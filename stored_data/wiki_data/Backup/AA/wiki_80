{"id": "8351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8351", "title": "David Mamet", "text": "David Mamet\n\nDavid Alan Mamet (; born November 30, 1947) is an American playwright, film director, screenwriter and author. He won a Pulitzer Prize and received Tony nominations for his plays \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1984) and \"Speed-the-Plow\" (1988). He first gained critical acclaim for a trio of off-Broadway 1970s plays: \"The Duck Variations,\" \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" and \"American Buffalo.\" His plays \"Race\" and \"The Penitent\", respectively, opened on Broadway in 2009 and previewed off-Broadway in 2017.\n\nFeature films that Mamet both wrote and directed include \"House of Games\" (1987), \"Homicide\" (1991), \"The Spanish Prisoner\" (1997) and his biggest commercial success \"Heist\" (2001). His screenwriting credits include \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1981), \"The Verdict\" (1982), \"The Untouchables\" (1987), \"Hoffa\" (1992), \"Wag the Dog\" (1997), and \"Hannibal\" (2001). Mamet himself wrote the screenplay for the 1992 adaptation of \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", and wrote and directed the 1994 adaptation of his play \"Oleanna\" (1992). He was the executive producer and frequent writer for the TV show \"The Unit\" (2006–2009).\n\nMamet's books include: \"On Directing Film\" (1991), a commentary and dialogue about film-making; \"The Old Religion\" (1997), a novel about the lynching of Leo Frank; \"Five Cities of Refuge: Weekly Reflections on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy\" (2004), a Torah commentary with Rabbi Lawrence Kushner; \"The Wicked Son\" (2006), a study of Jewish self-hatred and antisemitism; \"Bambi vs. Godzilla\", a commentary on the movie business; \"The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture\" (2011), a commentary on cultural and political issues; and \"Three War Stories\" (2013), a trio of novellas about the physical and psychological effects of war.\n\nMamet was born in 1947 in Chicago to Lenore June (née Silver), a teacher, and Bernard Morris Mamet, a labor attorney. His family was Jewish. His paternal grandparents were from Poland. One of Mamet's earliest jobs was as a busboy at Chicago's London House and The Second City. He also worked as an actor, editor for \"Oui\" magazine and as a cab-driver. He was educated at the progressive Francis W. Parker School and at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. At the Chicago Public Library Foundation 20th anniversary fundraiser in 2006, though, Mamet announced \"My alma mater is the Chicago Public Library. I got what little educational foundation I got in the third-floor reading room, under the tutelage of a Coca-Cola sign\".\n\nAfter a move to Chicago's North Side, Mamet encountered theater director Robert Sickinger, and began to work occasionally at Sickinger's Hull House Theatre. This represented the beginning of Mamet's lifelong involvement with the theater.\n\nMamet is a founding member of the Atlantic Theater Company; he first gained acclaim for a trio of off-Broadway plays in 1976, \"The Duck Variations,\" \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" and \"American Buffalo.\" He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" which received its first Broadway revival in the summer of 2005. His play \"Race\", which opened on Broadway on December 6, 2009 and featured James Spader, David Alan Grier, Kerry Washington, and Richard Thomas in the cast, received mixed reviews. His play \"The Anarchist\", starring Patti LuPone and Debra Winger, in her Broadway debut, opened on Broadway on November 13, 2012 in previews and was scheduled to close on December 16, 2012. His 2017 play \"The Penitent\" previewed off-Broadway on February 8, 2017.\n\nIn 2002, Mamet was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. Mamet later received the PEN/Laura Pels Theater Award for Grand Master of American Theater in 2010.\n\nIn 2017, Mamet released an online class for writers entitled \"David Mamet teaches dramatic writing\".\n\nIt was announced in 2019 that David Mamet will return to the London West End with his new play \"Bitter Wheat\" starring John Malkovich.\n\nMamet first film work was as a screenwriter, later directing his own scripts.\n\nMamet's first produced screenplay was the 1981 production of \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\", based on James M. Cain's novel. He received an Academy Award nomination one year later for \"The Verdict\", written in the late 1970s. He also wrote the screenplays for \"The Untouchables\" (1987), \"Hoffa\" (1992), \"The Edge\" (1997), \"Wag the Dog\" (1997), \"Ronin\" (1998), and \"Hannibal\" (2001). He received a second Academy Award nomination for \"Wag the Dog\".\n\nIn 1987, Mamet made his film directing debut with his screenplay \"House of Games\", which won Best Film and Best Screenplay awards at the 1987 Venice Film Festival and the Film of the Year in 1989 from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards. The film starred his then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, and many longtime stage associates and friends, including fellow Goddard College graduates. Mamet was quoted as saying, \"It was my first film as a director and I needed support, so I stacked the deck.\" After \"House of Games\", Mamet later wrote and directed two more films focusing on the world of con artists, \"The Spanish Prisoner\" (1997) and \"Heist\" (2001). Among those films, \"Heist\" enjoyed the biggest commercial success.\n\nOther films that Mamet both wrote and directed include: \"Things Change\" (1988), \"Homicide\" (1991) (nominated for the Palme d'Or at 1991 Cannes Film Festival and won a \"Screenwriter of the Year\" award for Mamet from the London Film Critics' Circle Awards), \"Oleanna\" (1994), \"The Winslow Boy\" (1999), \"State and Main\" (2000), \"Spartan\" (2004), \"Redbelt\" (2008), and the 2013 bio-pic TV movie \"Phil Spector\".\n\nA feature-length film, a thriller titled \"Blackbird\", was intended for release in 2015, but is still in development.\nWhen Mamet adapted his play for the 1992 film \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", he wrote an additional part (including the monologue \"Coffee's for closers\") for Alec Baldwin.\n\nMamet continues to work with an informal repertory company for his films, including Crouse, William H. Macy, Joe Mantegna, and Rebecca Pidgeon, as well as the aforementioned school friends.\n\nMamet did a rewrite of the script for \"Ronin\" under the pseudonym \"Richard Weisz\" and turned in an early version of a script for \"Malcolm X\" which was rejected by director Spike Lee. In 2000, Mamet directed a film version of \"Catastrophe,\" a one-act play by Samuel Beckett featuring Harold Pinter and John Gielgud (in his final screen performance). In 2008, he directed and wrote the mixed martial arts movie \"Redbelt,\" about a martial arts instructor tricked into fighting in a professional bout.\n\nIn \"On Directing Film,\" Mamet asserts that directors should focus on getting the point of a scene across, rather than simply following a protagonist, or adding visually beautiful or intriguing shots. Films should create order from disorder in search of the objective.\n\nIn 1990 Mamet published \"The Hero Pony\", a 55-page collection of poetry. He has also published a series of short plays, monologues and four novels, \"The Village\" (1994), \"The Old Religion\" (1997), \"Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources\" (2000), and \"Chicago\" (2018). He has written several non-fiction texts, and children's stories, including \"True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor\"(1997). In 2004 he published a lauded version of the classical Faust story, \"Faustus\", however, when the play was staged in San Francisco during the spring of 2004, it was not well received by critics. On May 1, 2010, Mamet released a graphic novel \"The Trials of Roderick Spode (The Human Ant)\".\n\nOn June 2, 2011, \"The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture\", Mamet's book detailing his conversion from modern liberalism to \"a reformed liberal\" was released.\n\nMamet published \"Three War Stories\", a collection of novellas, on November 11, 2013. In an interview with Newsmax TV, Mamet said he wanted to write about war, despite never having served. Moreover, the book allowed Mamet to free characters that had occupied his mind for years. On the subject of characters as a reason for writing, Mamet told the host, \"You want to get these guys out of your head. You just want them to stop talking to you.\"\n\nOne December 3, 2019, Mamet is set to publish a novel, \"The Diary of a Porn Star by Priscilla Wriston-Ranger: As Told to David Mamet With an Afterword by Mr. Mamet.\"\n\nMamet wrote the \"Wasted Weekend\" episode of \"Hill Street Blues\" that aired in 1987. His then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, appeared in numerous episodes (including that one) as Officer McBride. Mamet is also the creator, producer and frequent writer of the television series \"The Unit\", where he wrote a well-circulated memo to the writing staff. He directed a third-season episode of \"The Shield\" with Shawn Ryan. In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for Ford Motor Company. The two 30-second ads featured the Ford Edge and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery. Mamet's sister, Lynn, is a producer and writer for television shows, such as \"The Unit\" and \"Law & Order\".\n\nMamet has contributed several dramas to BBC Radio through Jarvis & Ayres Productions, including an adaptation of \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" for BBC Radio 3 and new dramas for BBC Radio 4. The comedy \"Keep Your Pantheon (or On the Whole I'd Rather Be in Mesopotamia)\" was aired in 2007.\n\nSince May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at \"The Huffington Post\", drawing satirical cartoons with themes including political strife in Israel. In a 2008 essay at \"The Village Voice\" titled \"Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal\" he revealed that he had gradually rejected so-called political correctness and progressivism and embraced conservatism. Mamet has spoken in interviews of changes in his views, highlighting his agreement with free market theorists such as Friedrich Hayek the historian Paul Johnson, and economist Thomas Sowell, whom Mamet called \"one of our greatest minds\".\n\nDuring promotion of a book, Mamet said British people had \"a taint of anti-semitism,\" claiming they \"want to give [Israel] away to some people whose claim is rather dubious.\" In the same interview, Mamet went on to say that \"there are famous dramatists and novelists [in the UK] whose works are full of anti-Semitic filth.\" He refused to give examples because of British libel laws (the interview was conducted in New York City for the \"Financial Times\"). He is known for his pro-Israel positions; in his book \"The Secret Knowledge\" he claimed that \"Israelis would like to live in peace within their borders; the Arabs would like to kill them all.\"\n\nMamet wrote an article for the November 2012 issue of \"The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles\" imploring fellow Jewish Americans to vote for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nIn an essay for \"Newsweek\", published on 29 January 2013, Mamet argued against gun control laws: \"It was intended to guard us against this inevitable decay of government that the Constitution was written. Its purpose was and is not to enthrone a Government superior to an imperfect and confused electorate, but to protect us from such a government.\"\n\nMamet has described the NFL anthem protests as “absolutely f***ing despicable”.\n\nMamet's style of writing dialogue, marked by a cynical, street-smart edge, precisely crafted for effect, is so distinctive that it has come to be called \"Mamet speak.\" Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write \"pretty\" at the expense of sound, logical plots. When asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, \"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed.\"\n\nOne instance of Mamet's dialogue style can be found in \"Glengarry Glen Ross\", in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employer's office. George Aaronow and Dave Moss equivocate on the meaning of \"talk\" and \"speak\", turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes:\n\nMamet dedicated \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" to Harold Pinter, who was instrumental in its being first staged at the Royal National Theatre, (London) in 1983, and whom Mamet has acknowledged as an influence on its success, and on his other work.\n\nMamet's plays have frequently sparked debate and controversy. During a staging of \"Oleanna\" in 1992, in which a post-secondary student accuses her professor of sexual harassment, a critic reported that the play divided the audience by gender and recounted \"couples emerged screaming at each other\".\n\nArthur Holmberg in his 2014 book \"David Mamet and Male Friendship\", has reconsidered the gender issue in many of Mamet's plays throughout his career by asserting a prominent and recurrent reversed sexual orientation of portrayed male gender preferences.\n\nMamet and actress Lindsay Crouse married in 1977 and divorced in 1990. The couple have two children, Willa and Zosia. Willa was a professional photographer and is now a singer/songwriter; Zosia is an actress. Mamet has been married to actress and singer-songwriter Rebecca Pidgeon since 1991. They live together in Santa Monica, California. They have two children, Clara and Noah.\n\nMamet is a Reform Jew and strongly pro-Israel.\n\nThe papers of David Mamet were sold to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 2007 and first opened for research in 2009. The growing collection consists mainly of manuscripts and related production materials for most of his plays, films, and other writings, but also includes his personal journals from 1966 to 2005. In 2015, the Ransom Center secured a second major addition to Mamet's papers that include more recent works. Additional materials relating to Mamet and his career can be found in the Ransom Center's collections of Robert De Niro, Mel Gussow, Tom Stoppard, Sam Shepard, Paul Schrader, Don DeLillo, and John Russell Brown.\n\nMamet is credited as writer of these works except where noted.

{"id": "8361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8361", "title": "Definable real number", "text": "Definable real number\n\nInformally, a definable real number is a real number that can be uniquely specified by its description. The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a formal language. For example, the positive square root of 2, formula_1, can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation formula_2, and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.\n\nDifferent choices of a formal language or its interpretation can give rise to different notions of definability. Specific varieties of definable numbers include the constructible numbers of geometry, the algebraic numbers, and the computable numbers.\n\nOne way of specifying a real number uses geometric techniques. A real number \"r\" is a constructible number if there is a method to construct a line segment of length \"r\" using a compass and straightedge, beginning with a fixed line segment of length 1.\n\nEach positive integer, and each positive rational number, is constructible. The positive square root of 2 is constructible. However, the cube root of 2 is not constructible; this is related to the impossibility of doubling the cube.\n\nA real number \"r\" is called an algebraic number if there is a polynomial \"p\"(\"x\"), with only integer coefficients, so that \"r\" is a root of \"p\", that is, \"p\"(\"r\")=0. \nEach algebraic number can be defined individually using the order relation on the reals. For example, if a polynomial \"q\"(\"x\") has 5 roots, the third one can be defined as the unique \"r\" such that \"q\"(\"r\") = 0 and such that there are two distinct numbers less than \"r\" for which \"q\" is zero.\n\nAll rational numbers are algebraic, and all constructible numbers are algebraic. There are numbers such as the cube root of 2 which are algebraic but not constructible.\n\nThe algebraic numbers form a subfield of the real numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are algebraic numbers and, moreover, if \"a\" and \"b\" are algebraic numbers, then so are \"a\"+\"b\", \"a\"−\"b\", \"ab\" and, if \"b\" is nonzero, \"a\"/\"b\".\n\nThe algebraic numbers also have the property, which goes beyond being a subfield of the reals, that for each positive integer \"n\" and each algebraic number \"a\", all of the \"n\"th roots of \"a\" that are real numbers are also algebraic.\n\nThere are only countably many algebraic numbers, but there are uncountably many real numbers, so in the sense of cardinality most real numbers are not algebraic. This nonconstructive proof that not all real numbers are algebraic was first published by\nGeorg Cantor in his 1874 paper \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\".\n\nNon-algebraic numbers are called transcendental numbers. Specific examples of transcendental numbers include π and Euler's number \"e\".\n\nA real number is a computable number if there is an algorithm that, given a natural number \"n\", produces a decimal expansion for the number accurate to \"n\" decimal places. This notion was introduced by Alan Turing in 1936.\n\nThe computable numbers include the algebraic numbers along with many transcendental numbers including π and \"e\". Like the algebraic numbers, the computable numbers also form a subfield of the real numbers, and the positive computable numbers are closed under taking \"n\"th roots for each positive \"n\".\n\nNot all real numbers are computable. The entire set of computable numbers is countable, so most reals are not computable. Specific examples of noncomputable real numbers include the limits of Specker sequences, and algorithmically random real numbers such as Chaitin's Ω numbers.\n\nAnother notion of definability comes from the formal theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic. The language of arithmetic has symbols for 0, 1, the successor operation, addition, and multiplication, intended to be interpreted in the usual way over the natural numbers. Because no variables of this language range over the real numbers, a different sort of definability is needed to refer to real numbers. A real number \"a\" is \"definable in the language of arithmetic\" (or \"arithmetical\") if its Dedekind cut can be defined as a predicate in that language; that is, if there is a first-order formula \"φ\" in the language of arithmetic, with three free variables, such that\n\nA real number \"a\" is first-order definable in the language of set theory, without parameters, if there is a formula \"φ\" in the language of set theory, with one free variable, such that \"a\" is the unique real number such that \"φ\"(\"a\") holds (see ). This notion cannot be expressed as a formula in the language of set theory.\n\nAll analytical numbers, and in particular all computable numbers, are definable in the language of set theory. Thus the real numbers definable in the language of set theory include all familiar real numbers such as 0, 1, π, \"e\", et cetera, along with all algebraic numbers. Assuming that they form a set in the model, the real numbers definable in the language of set theory over a particular model of ZFC form a field. \nEach set model \"M\" of ZFC set theory that contains uncountably many real numbers must contain real numbers that are not definable within \"M\" (without parameters). This follows from the fact that there are only countably many formulas, and so only countably many elements of \"M\" can be definable over \"M\". Thus, if \"M\" has uncountably many real numbers, we can prove from \"outside\" \"M\" that not every real number of \"M\" is definable over \"M\". \nThis argument becomes more problematic if it is applied to class models of ZFC, such as the von Neumann universe .

{"id": "8362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8362", "title": "Diego de Almagro", "text": "Diego de Almagro\n\nDiego de Almagro (; – July 8, 1538), also known as El Adelantado and El Viejo, was a Spanish conquistador known for his exploits in western South America. He participated with Francisco Pizarro in the Spanish conquest of Peru. From Peru Almagro led an expedition that made him the second European to set foot in central Chile (after ). Back in Peru a longstanding conflict with Pizarro over the control of the former Inca capital of Cuzco erupted into a civil war between the two bands of conquistadores. In the battle of Las Salinas in 1538 Almagro was defeated by the Pizarro brothers and months later he was executed.\n\nThe origins of Diego de Almagro remain obscure. He was born in 1475 in the village of Almagro, 1 in Ciudad Real, where he took the surname for being the illegitimate son of Juan de Montenegro and Elvira Gutiérrez. In order to save the honor of the mother, her relatives took her infant and moved him to the nearby town of Bolaños de Calatrava, being raised in this town and in Aldea del Rey, run by Sancha López del Peral.\n\nWhen he turned 4 he returned to Almagro, being under the tutelage of an uncle named Hernán Gutiérrez until he was 15 years old, when due to his uncle's hardness he ran away from home. He went to the home of his mother, who was now living with her new husband, to tell her what had happened and that he was going to travel the world, asking for some bread to help her live in her misery. His mother, anguished, gave him a piece of bread and some coins and said: \"\"Take, son, and do not give me more pressure, and go, and God help in your adventure.\"\"\n\nHe went to Seville and after probably stealing to survive the boy becomes a \"criado\" or servant and raised by Don Luis de Polanco, one of the four mayors of the Catholic Monarchs and later his counselor, and who was mayor of that city. While performing his duties as a servant, Almagro stabbed another servant for certain differences, leaving him with injuries so serious that they motivated that a trial against him be promoted.\n\nBeing wanted for justice, Don Luis de Polanco, making use of his influence, got Don Pedro Arias de Avila to allow him to embark in one of the ships that would go to the New World from the port of Sanlucar de Barrameda. The Casa de Contratacion demanded that the men who crossed the Indies carry their own weapons, clothes, and farming tools, which Don Polanco provided to his servant.\n\nDiego de Almagro arrived in the New World on June 30, 1514, under the expedition that Ferdinand II of Aragon had sent under the guidance of Pedrarias Dávila. The expedition had landed in the city of Santa María la Antigua del Darién, Panama, where many other future conquistadors had already arrived, among them Francisco Pizarro.\n\nThere are not many details of Almagro's activities during this period, but it is known that he accompanied various sailors who departed from the city of Darien between 1514 and 1515. De Almagro eventually returned and settled in Darien, where he was granted an encomienda. He built a house and made a living from agriculture.\n\nDe Almagro undertook his first conquest on November 1515, commanding 260 men as he founded Villa del Acla, named after the Indian place. Due to illness he had to leave behind this mission to the licenciate Gaspar de Espinosa.\n\nEspinosa decided to undertake a new expedition, which departed in December 1515 with 200 men, including De Almagro and Francisco Pizarro, who for the first time was designated as a captain. During this expedition, which lasted 14 months, De Almagro, Pizarro and Hernando de Luque became close friends.\n\nAlso during this time De Almagro established a friendship with Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who was in charge of Acla. De Almagro wanted to have a ship built with the remaining materials of the Espinosa expedition, to be finished on the coast of the \"Great South Sea\", as the Pacific Ocean was first called by the Spanish. Current historians do not believe that De Almagro was expected to participate in Balboa's expedition and probably returned to Darien.\n\nDe Almagro took part in the various expeditions that took place in the Gulf of Panama, taking part again in Espinosa's parties. Espinosa was supported by using Balboa's ships. De Almagro was recorded as a witness on the lists of natives whom Espinosa ordered to be carried. De Almagro remained as an early settler in the newly founded city of Panama. For four years he stayed there, working at the management of his properties and those of Pizarro. He took Ana Martínez, an indigenous woman, as a common-law wife. In this period, his first son, el \"Mozo\", was born to them.\n\nBy 1524 an association of conquest regarding South America was formalized among Almagro, Pizarro and Luque. By the beginning of August 1524, they had received the requisite permission to discover and conquer lands further south. De Almagro would remain in Panama to recruit men and gather supplies for the expeditions led by Pizarro.\n\nAfter several expeditions to South America, Pizarro secured his stay in Peru with the \"Capitulation\" on 6 July 1529. During Pizarro's continued exploration of Incan territory, he and his men succeeded in defeating the Inca army under Emperor Atahualpa during the Battle of Cajamarca in 1532. De Almagro joined Pizarro soon afterward, bringing more men and arms.\n\nAfter Peru fell to the Spanish, both Pizarro and De Almagro initially worked together in the founding of new cities to consolidate their dominions. As such, Pizarro dispatched De Almagro to pursue Quizquiz, fleeing to the Inca Empire's northern city of Quito. Their fellow conquistador Sebastián de Belalcázar, who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito and witnessed the destruction of the city by Inca general Rumiñawi. The Inca warrior had ordered the city to be burned and its gold to be buried at an undisclosed location where the Spanish could never find it. The arrival of Pedro de Alvarado from Guatemala, in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for Almagro and Belalcázar. Alvarado's presence, however, did not last long as he left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro.\n\nIn an attempt to claim Quito ahead of Belalcázar, in August 1534 De Almagro founded a city on the shores of Laguna de Colta (Colta Lake) in the foothills of Chimborazo, some south of present-day Quito, and named it \"Santiago de Quito.\" Four months later would come the foundation of the Peruvian city of Trujillo, which Almagro named as \"Villa Trujillo de Nueva Castilla\" (the Village of Trujillo in New Castille) in honor of Francisco Pizarro's birthplace, Trujillo in Extremadura, Spain. These events were the height of the Pizarro-Almagro friendship, which historians describe as one of the last events in which their friendship soon faded and entered a period of turmoil for the control of the Incan capital of Cuzco.\n\nAfter splitting the treasure of Inca emperor Atahualpa, both Pizarro and Almagro left towards Cuzco and took the city in 1533. However, De Almagro's friendship with Pizarro showed signs of deterioration in 1526 when Pizarro, in the name of the rest of the conquistadors, called forth the \"Capitulacion de Toledo\" law in which King Charles I of Spain had laid out his authorization for the conquest of Peru and the awards every conquistador would receive from it. Long before, however, each conquistador had promised to equally split the benefits. Pizarro managed to have a larger stake and awards for himself. Despite this, De Almagro still obtained an important fortune for his services, and the King awarded him in November 1532 the noble title of \"Don\" and he was assigned a personal coat of arms.\n\nAlthough by this time Diego de Almagro had already acquired sufficient wealth in the conquest of Peru and was living a luxurious life in Cuzco, the prospect of conquering the lands further south was very attractive to him. Given that the dispute with Pizarro over Cuzco had kept intensifying, Almagro spent a great deal of time and money equipping a company of 500 men for a new exploration south of Peru.\n\nBy 1534 the Spanish crown had determined to split the region in two parallel lines, forming the governorship of \"Nueva Castilla\" (from the 1° to the 14° latitude, close to Pisco), and that of \"Nueva Toledo\" (from the 14° to the 25° latitude, in Taltal, Chile), assigning the first to Francisco Pizarro and the second to Diego de Almagro. The crown had previously assigned Almagro the governorship of Cuzco, and as such De Almagro was heading there when Charles V divided the territory between Nueva Castilla and Nuevo Toledo. This might have been the reason why Almagro did not immediately confront Pizarro for Cuzco, and promptly decided to embark on his new quest for the discovery of the riches of Chile.\n\nCharles V had given Diego a grant extending two hundred leagues south of Francisco Pizarro's. Francisco and Diego concluded a new contract on 12 June 1535, in which they agreed to share future discoveries equally. Diego raised an expedition for Chile, expecting it \"would lead to even greater riches than they had found in Peru.\" Almagro prepared the way by sending ahead three of his Spanish soldiers, the religious chief of the Inca empire, Willaq Umu, and Paullo Topa, brother of Manco Inca Yupanqui. De Almagro sent Juan de Saavedra forward with one hundred and fifty men, and soon followed them with additional forces. Saavedra established on January 23, 1535 the first Spanish settlement in Bolivia near the Inca regional capital of Paria.\n\nAlmagro left Cuzco on July 3, 1535 with his supporters and stopped at Moina until the 20th of that month. Meanwhile, Francisco Pizarro's brother, Juan Pizarro, had arrested Inca Manco Inca Yupanqui, further complicating De Almagro's plans as it heavily increased the dissatisfaction of the Indians submitted to Spanish rule. Not having formally been appointed governor of any territories in the Capitulation of Toledo in 1528, however, forcing him to declare himself \"adelantado\" (governor) of Nueva Toledo, or southern Peru and present-day Chile. Some sources suggest Almagro received such a requirement in 1534 by the Spanish king and was officially declared governor of New Toledo.\n\nOnce he left Moina, De Almagro followed the Inca trail followed by 750 Spaniards deciding to join him in quest for the gold lost in the ransom of Atahualpa, which had mainly benefited the Pizarro brothers and their supporters. After crossing the Bolivian mountain range and traveling past Lake Titicaca, Almagro arrived on the shores of the Desaguadero River and finally set up camp in Tupiza. From there, the expedition stopped at Chicoana and then turned to the southeast to cross the Andes mountains.\n\nThe expedition turned out to be a difficult and exhausting endeavor. The hardest phase was the crossing of the Andean cordilleras: the cold, hunger and tiredness meant the death of various Spanish and natives, but mainly slaves who were not accustomed to such rigorous climate.\n\nUpon this point, De Almagro determined everything was a failure. He ordered a small group under Rodrigo Orgonez on a reconnaissance of the country to the south.\n\nBy luck, these men found the Valley of Copiapó, where Gonzalo Calvo Barrientos, a Spanish soldier whom Pizarro had expelled from Peru for stealing objects the Inca had offered for his ransom, had already established a friendship with the local natives. There, in the valley of the river Copiapó, Almagro took official possession of Chile and claimed it in the name of King Charles V.\n\nDe Almagro promptly initiated the exploration of the new territory, starting up the valley the Aconcagua River, where he was well received by the natives. However, the intrigues of his interpreter, Felipillo, who had previously helped Pizarro in dealing with \"Atahualpa\", almost thwarted De Almagro's efforts. Felipillo had secretly urged the local natives to attack the Spanish, but they desisted, not understanding the dangers that they posed. De Almagro directed Gómez de Alvarado along with 100 horsemen and 100 foot to continue the exploration, which ended in the confluence of the Ñuble and Itata rivers. The Battle of Reinohuelén between the Spanish and hostile Mapuche Indians forced the explorers to return to the north.\n\nDe Almagro's own reconnaissance of the land and the bad news of Gómez de Alvarado's encounter with the fierce Mapuche, along with the bitter cold winter that settled ferociously upon them, only served to confirm that everything had failed. He never found gold or the cities which Incan scouts had told him lay ahead, only communities of the indigenous population who lived from subsistence agriculture. Local tribes put up fierce resistance to the Spanish forces. The exploration of the territories of Nueva Toledo, which lasted 2 years, was marked by a complete failure for De Almagro. Despite this, at first he thought staying and founding a city would serve well for his honor. The initial optimism that led Almagro to bring his son he had with the indigenous Panamanian Ana Martínez to Chile had faded.\n\nSome historians have suggested that, but for the urging of his senior explorers, De Almagro would probably have stayed permanently in Chile. He was urged to return to Peru and this time take definitive possession of Cuzco, so as to consolidate an inheritance for his son. Dismayed with his experience in the south, Almagro made plans of return to Peru. He never officially founded a city in the territory of what is now Chile.\n\nThe withdrawal of the Spanish from valleys of Chile was violent: Almagro authorized his soldiers to ransack the natives' properties, leaving their soil desolate. In addition, the Spanish soldiers took natives captive to serve as slaves. The locals were captured, tied together, and forced to carry the heavy loads belonging to the conquistadors.\n\nAfter the exhausting crossing of the Atacama Desert, mainly due to the weather conditions, Almagro finally reached Cuzco, Peru, in 1537. According to some authors, it was during this time that the Spanish term \"\"roto\"\" (torn), used by Peruvians to refer to Chileans, was first coined. De Almagro's disappointed troops returned to Cuzco with their \"torn clothes\" due to the extensive and laborious passage on foot by the Atacama Desert.\n\nAfter his return, De Almagro was surprised to learn of the Inca Manco's rebellion. Diego de Almagro sent an embassy to the Inca, but they mistrusted all of the Spaniards by this time. Hernando Pizarro's men formed an uneasy truce with De Almagro's men, surveying to determine the boundaries of their leaders' royal grants. They needed to determine in which portion the city of Cuzco was located. However, De Almagro's troops quickly took the city and imprisoned the Pizarro brothers, Hernando and Gonzalo, on the night of 8 April 1537.\n\nAfter occupying Cuzco, De Almagro confronted an army sent by Francisco Pizarro to liberate his brothers. Alonso de Alvarado commanded it and was defeated during the Battle of Abancay on July 12, 1537. He and some of his men were imprisoned. Later, Gonzalo Pizarro and De Alvarado escaped prison. Subsequent negotiations between Francisco Pizarro and De Almagro concluded with the liberation of Hernando, the third Pizarro brother, in return for conceding control and administration of Cuzco to De Almagro. Pizarro never intended to give up the city permanently, but was buying time to organize an army strong enough to defeat Almagro's troops. \n\nDuring this time Almagro fell ill, and Pizarro and his brothers grabbed the opportunity to defeat him and his followers. The Almagristas were defeated at Las Salinas in April 1538, with Orgóñez being killed on the field of battle. De Almagro fled to Cuzco, still in the hands of his loyal supporters, but found only temporary refuge; the forces of the Pizarro brothers entered the city without resistance. Once captured, Almagro was humiliated by Hernando Pizarro and his requests to appeal to the King were ignored.\n\nWhen Diego de Almagro begged for his life, Hernando responded:\n\n\"-he was surprised to see Almagro demean himself in a manner so unbecoming a brave cavalier, that his fate was no worse than had befallen many a soldier before him; and that, since God had given him the grace to be a Christian, he should employ his remaining moments in making up his account with Heaven!\"\n\nAlmagro was condemned to death and executed by \"garrote\" in his dungeon, and then decapitated, on July 8, 1538. His corpse was taken to the public Plaza Mayor of Cuzco, where a herald proclaimed his crimes. Hernán Ponce de León took his body and buried him in the church of Our Lady of Mercy in Cuzco.\n\nDiego de Almagro II (1520–1542), known as \"El Mozo\" (The Lad), son of Diego de Almagro I, whose mother was an Indian girl of Panama, became the foil of the conspirators who had put Pizarro to the sword. Pizarro was murdered on June 26, 1541; the conspirators promptly proclaimed the lad De Almagro Governor of Peru. From various causes, all of the conspirators either died or were killed except for one, who was executed after the lad Almagro gave an order. The lad De Almagro fought the desperate battle of Chupas on September 16, 1542, escaped to Cuzco, but was arrested, immediately condemned to death, and executed in the great square of the city.\n\nBULLET::::- History of Cusco\nBULLET::::- List of conquistadors in Colombia\nBULLET::::- Spanish conquest of the Muisca\nBULLET::::- Spanish conquest of the Kuna\nBULLET::::- Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire\nBULLET::::- History of Chile\nBULLET::::- Pedro de Valdivia, Alonso de Ojeda\n\n\nBULLET::::- Documental sources and bibliographies for the study of the History of Chile by the University of Chile\nBULLET::::- The conquistadores, description of the profile of the conquistadors that arrived in America in search of honor and fortune in the name of the Spanish monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church\nBULLET::::- History of Chile by José Del Pozo\n"}
{"id": "8363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8363", "title": "Divinity", "text": "Divinity\n\nIn religion, divinity or Godhead is the state of things that are believed to come from a supernatural power or deity, such as God, the supreme being, creator deity, or spirits, and are therefore regarded as sacred and holy. Such things are regarded as divine due to their transcendental origins or because their attributes or qualities are superior or supreme relative to things of the Earth. Divine things are regarded as eternal and based in truth, while material things are regarded as ephemeral and based in illusion. Such things that may qualify as divine are apparitions, visions, prophecies, miracles, and in some views also the soul, or more general things like resurrection, immortality, grace, and salvation. Otherwise what is or is not divine may be loosely defined, as it is used by different belief systems.\n\nThe root of the word \"divine\" is literally \"godly\" (from the Latin \"deus\", cf. \"Dyaus\", closely related to Greek \"zeus\", \"div\" in Persian and \"deva\" in Sanskrit), but the use varies significantly depending on which deity is being discussed. This article outlines the major distinctions in the conventional use of the terms.\n\nFor specific related academic terms, see Divinity (academic discipline), or Divine (Anglican).\n\nDivinity as a quality has two distinct usages:\nBULLET::::- Divine force or power - powers or forces that are universal, or transcend human capacities\nBULLET::::- Divinity applied to mortals - qualities of individuals who are considered to have some special access or relationship to the divine.\n\nOverlap occurs between these usages because deities or godly entities are often identical with or identified by the powers and forces that are credited to them — in many cases a deity is merely a power or force personified — and these powers and forces may then be extended or granted to mortal individuals. For instance, Jehovah is closely associated with storms and thunder throughout much of the Old Testament. He is said to speak in thunder, and thunder is seen as a token of his anger. This power was then extended to prophets like Moses and Samuel, who caused thunderous storms to rain down on their enemies. (See and 1 Samuel 12:18.)\nDivinity always carries connotations of goodness, beauty, beneficence, justice, and other positive, pro-social attributes. In monotheistic faiths there is an equivalent cohort of malefic supernatural beings and powers, such as demons, devils, afreet, etc., which are not conventionally referred to as divine; \"demonic\" is often used instead. Pantheistic and polytheistic faiths make no such distinction; gods and other beings of transcendent power often have complex, ignoble, or even irrational motivations for their acts. Note that while the terms \"demon\" and \"demonic\" are used in monotheistic faiths as antonyms to \"divine\", they are in fact derived from the Greek word \"daimón\" (δαίμων), which itself translates as \"divinity\".\n\nThere are three distinct usages of \"divinity\" and \"divine\" in religious discourse:\n\nIn monotheistic faiths, the word \"divinity\" is often used to refer to the singular God central to that faith. Often the word takes the definite article and is capitalized — \"\"the Divinity\"\" — as though it were a proper name or definitive honorific. \n\"Divine\" — capitalized — may be used as an adjective to refer to the manifestations of such a Divinity or its powers: e.g. \"basking in the Divine presence...\"\n\nThe terms \"divinity\" and \"divine\" — uncapitalized, and lacking the definite article — are sometimes used as to denote 'god(s) or certain other beings and entities which fall short of absolute Godhood but lie outside the human realm. These include (by no means an exhaustive list):\n\nAs previously noted, divinities are closely related to the transcendent force(s) or power(s) credited to them, so much so that in some cases the powers or forces may themselves be invoked independently. This leads to the second usage of the word \"divine\" (and a less common usage of \"divinity\"): to refer to the operation of transcendent power in the world.\n\nIn its most direct form, the operation of transcendent power implies some form of divine intervention. For pan- and polytheistic faiths this usually implies the direct action of one god or another on the course of human events. In Greek legend, for instance, it was Poseidon (god of the sea) who raised the storms that blew Odysseus's craft off course on his return journey, and Japanese tradition holds that a god-sent wind saved them from Mongol invasion. Prayers or propitiations are often offered to specific gods of pantheisms to garner favorable interventions in particular enterprises: e.g. safe journeys, success in war, or a season of bountiful crops. Many faiths around the world — from Japanese Shinto and Chinese traditional religion, to certain African practices and the faiths derived from those in the Caribbean, to Native American beliefs — hold that ancestral or household deities offer daily protection and blessings. In monotheistic religions, divine intervention may take very direct forms: miracles, visions, or intercessions by blessed figures.\n\nTranscendent force or power may also operate through more subtle and indirect paths. Monotheistic faiths generally support some version of divine providence, which acknowledges that the divinity of the faith has a profound but unknowable plan always unfolding in the world. Unforeseeable, overwhelming, or seemingly unjust events are often thrown on 'the will of the Divine', in deferences like the Muslim \"inshallah\" ('as God wills it') and Christian 'God works in mysterious ways'. Often such faiths hold out the possibility of divine retribution as well, where the divinity will unexpectedly bring evil-doers to justice through the conventional workings of the world; from the subtle redressing of minor personal wrongs, to such large-scale havoc as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah or the biblical Great Flood. Other faiths are even more subtle: the doctrine of \"karma\" shared by Buddhism and Hinduism is a divine law similar to divine retribution but without the connotation of punishment: our acts, good or bad, intentional or unintentional, reflect back on us as part of the natural working of the universe. Philosophical Taoism also proposes a transcendent operant principle — transliterated in English as \"tao\" or \"dao\", meaning 'the way' — which is neither an entity or a being per se, but reflects the natural ongoing process of the world. Modern western mysticism and new age philosophy often use the term 'the Divine' as a noun in this latter sense: a non-specific principle or being that gives rise to the world, and acts as the source or wellspring of life. In these latter cases the faiths do not promote deference, as happens in monotheisms; rather each suggests a path of action that will bring the practitioner into conformance with the divine law: \"ahimsa\" — 'no harm' — for Buddhist and Hindu faiths; \"de\" or \"te\" — 'virtuous action' — in Taoism; and any of numerous practices of peace and love in new age thinking.\n\nIn the third usage, extensions of divinity and divine power are credited to living, mortal individuals. Political leaders are known to have claimed actual divinity in certain early societies — the ancient Egyptian Pharaohs being the premier case — taking a role as objects of worship and being credited with superhuman status and powers. More commonly, and more pertinent to recent history, leaders merely claim some form of divine mandate, suggesting that their rule is in accordance with the will of God. The doctrine of the divine right of kings was introduced as late as the 17th century, proposing that kings rule by divine decree; Japanese Emperors ruled by divine mandate until the inception of the Japanese constitution after World War II.\n\nLess politically, most faiths have any number of people that are believed to have been touched by divine forces: saints, prophets, heroes, oracles, martyrs, and enlightened beings, among others. Saint Francis of Assisi, in Catholicism, is said to have received instruction directly from God and it is believed that he grants plenary indulgence to all who confess their sins and visit his chapel on the appropriate day. In Greek mythology, Achilles' mother bathed him in the river Styx to give him immortality, and Hercules — as the son of Zeus — inherited near-godly powers. In religious Taoism, Lao Tsu is venerated as a saint with his own powers. Various individuals in the Buddhist faith, beginning with Siddhartha, are considered to be enlightened, and in religious forms of Buddhism they are credited with divine powers. Christ in the Bible is said to be God's Son and is said to have performed divine miracles.\n\nIn general, mortals with divine qualities are carefully distinguished from the deity or deities in their religion's main pantheon. Even the Christian faith, which generally holds Christ to be identical to God, distinguishes between God the Father and Christ the begotten Son. There are, however, certain esoteric and mystical schools of thought, present in many faiths — Sufis in Islam, Gnostics in Christianity, Advaitan Hindus, Zen Buddhists, as well as several non-specific perspectives developed in new age philosophy — which hold that all humans are in essence divine, or unified with the Divine in a non-trivial way. Such divinity, in these faiths, would express itself naturally if it were not obscured by the social and physical worlds we live in; it needs to be brought to the fore through appropriate spiritual practices.\n\nIn traditional Christian theology, the concept and nature of divinity always has its source ultimately from God himself. It's the state or quality of being divine, and the term can denote Godly nature or character. In Hebrew, the terms would usually be \"el\", \"elohim\", and in Greek usually \"theos\", or \"theias\". The divinity in the Bible is considered the Godhead itself, or God in general. Or it may have reference to a deity. Even angels in the Psalms are considered divine or \"elohim\", as spirit beings, in God's form.\n\nIn the New Testament the Greek word θεῖον (\"theion\") in the Douay Version, is translated as \"divinity\". Examples are below:\nBULLET::::- Acts 17:29\nBULLET::::- Romans 1:20\nBULLET::::- Revelation 5:12\n\nThe word translated as either \"deity\", \"Godhead\", or \"divinity\" in the Greek New Testament is also the Greek word θεότητος (\"theotētos\"), and the one Verse that contains it is this:\nColossians 2:9\n\nThe word \"divine\" in the New Testament is the Greek word θείας (\"theias\"), and is the adjective form of \"divinity\". Biblical examples from the King James Bible are below:\nBULLET::::- 2 Peter 1:3\nBULLET::::- 2 Peter 1:4\n\nThe most prominent conception of divine entities in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the Godhead, a divine council of three distinct beings: Elohim (the Father), Jehovah (the Son, or Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Joseph Smith described a nontrinitarian Godhead, with God the Father and Jesus Christ each having individual physical bodies, and the Holy Spirit as a distinct personage with a spirit body. Smith also introduced the existence of a Heavenly Mother in the King Follett Discourse, but very little is acknowledged or known beyond her existence.\n\nMormons hold a belief in the divine potential of humanity; Smith taught a form of divinization where mortal men and women can become like god through salvation and exaltation. Lorenzo Snow succinctly summarized this using a couplet, which is often repeated within the LDS Church: \"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.\"\n\nBULLET::::- Apotheosis\nBULLET::::- Catholic views on God\nBULLET::::- Christology\nBULLET::::- Deity\nBULLET::::- Ho'oponopono (Morrnah section)\nBULLET::::- List of deities\nBULLET::::- Theosis\n"}
{"id": "8367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8367", "title": "Depth of field", "text": "Depth of field\n\nFor many cameras, depth of field (DOF) is the distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image. The depth of field can be calculated based on focal length, distance to subject, the acceptable circle of confusion size, and aperture. A particular depth of field may be chosen for technical or artistic purposes. Limitations of depth of field can sometimes be overcome with various techniques/equipment.\n\nFor Cameras that can only focus on one object distance at a time, Depth of field is the distance between the nearest and the farthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus. \"Acceptably sharp focus\" is defined using a property called the \"circle of confusion\".\n\nThe depth of field can be determined by focal length, distance to subject, the acceptable circle of confusion size, and aperture. The approximate depth of field can be given by:\n\nfor a given circle of confusion, c, focal length, f, F-number, N, and distance to subject, u.\n\nAs distance or the size of the acceptable circle of confusion increases, the depth of field increases; however, increasing the size of the aperture or increasing the focal length reduces the depth of field. Depth of Field changes linearly with F-number and circle of confusion, but changes in proportional to the square of the focal length and the distance to the subject. As a result, photos taken at extremely close range have a proportionally much smaller depth of field.\n\nSensor size affects DOF only in that changing the sensor size on a camera requires changing the focal length to get the same picture. It is the change in focal length that then affects the DOF.\n\nFor a given subject framing and camera position, the DOF is controlled by the lens aperture diameter, which is usually specified as the f-number (the ratio of lens focal length to aperture diameter). Reducing the aperture diameter (increasing the f-number) increases the DOF because only the light travelling at shallower angles passes through the aperture. Because the angles are shallow, the light rays are within the acceptable circle of confusion for a greater distance.\n\nMotion pictures make only limited use of this control; to produce a consistent image quality from shot to shot, cinematographers usually choose a single aperture setting for interiors and another for exteriors, and adjust exposure through the use of camera filters or light levels. Aperture settings are adjusted more frequently in still photography, where variations in depth of field are used to produce a variety of special effects.\n\nPrecise focus is only possible at an exact distance from the lens; at that distance, a point object will produce a point image. Otherwise, a point object will produce a blur spot shaped like the aperture, typically and approximately a circle. When this circular spot is sufficiently small, it is visually indistinguishable from a point, and appears to be in focus. The diameter of the largest circle that is indistinguishable from a point is known as the acceptable circle of confusion, or informally, simply as the circle of confusion. Points that produce a blur spot smaller than this acceptable circle of confusion are considered acceptably sharp.\n\nThe acceptable circle of confusion depends on how the final image will be used. It is generally accepted to be 0.25 mm for an image viewed from 25 cm away.\n\nFor 35 mm motion pictures, the image area on the film is roughly 22 mm by 16 mm. The limit of tolerable error was traditionally set at 0.05 mm (0.002 in) diameter, while for 16 mm film, where the size is about half as large, the tolerance is stricter, 0.025 mm (0.001 in). More modern practice for 35 mm productions set the circle of confusion limit at 0.025 mm (0.001 in).\n\nThe plane of focus (POF) in object space is normally parallel to the image plane. However, tilting the lens relative to the sensor can rotate the POF.\n\nWhen the POF is rotated, the near and far limits of DOF are no longer parallel; the DOF becomes wedge-shaped, with the apex of the wedge nearest the camera.\n\nIn some cases, rotating the POF can better fit the DOF to the scene, and achieve the required sharpness at a smaller f-number. Alternatively, rotating the POF, in combination with a small f-number, can minimize the part of an image that is within the DOF.\n\nTraditional depth-of-field formulas can be hard to use in practice. As an alternative, the same effective calculation can be done without regard to the focal length and f-number. Moritz von Rohr and later Merklinger observe that the effective absolute aperture diameter can be used for similar formula in certain circumstances.\n\nMoreover, traditional depth-of-field formulas assume equal acceptable circles of confusion for near and far objects. Merklinger suggested that distant objects often need to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, do not need to be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the \"object field method\" by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.\n\nOther authors such as Ansel Adams have taken the opposite position, maintaining that slight unsharpness in foreground objects is usually more disturbing than slight unsharpness in distant parts of a scene.\n\nSome methods and equipment allow altering the apparent DOF, and some even allow the DOF to be determined after the image is made. For example, Focus stacking combines multiple images focused on different planes, resulting in an image with a greater (or less, if so desired) apparent depth of field than any of the individual source images. Similarly, in order to reconstruct the 3-dimensional shape of an object, a depth map can be generated from multiple photographs with different depths of field. This method is called \"shape from focus.\"\n\nOther technologies use a combination of lens design and post-processing: Wavefront coding is a method by which controlled aberrations are added to the optical system so that the focus and depth of field can be improved later in the process.\n\nThe lens design can be changed even more: in colour apodization the lens is modified such that each colour channel has a different lens aperture. For example, the red channel may be \"f\"/2.4, green may be \"f\"/2.4, whilst the blue channel may be \"f\"/5.6. Therefore, the blue channel will have a greater depth of field than the other colours. The image processing identifies blurred regions in the red and green channels and in these regions copies the sharper edge data from the blue channel. The result is an image that combines the best features from the different \"f\"-numbers.\n\nAt the extreme, a plenoptic camera captures 4D light field information about a scene, so the focus and depth of field can be altered after the photo is taken.\n\nDiffraction causes images to lose sharpness at high F-numbers, and hence limits the potential depth of field. In general photography this is rarely an issue; because large f-numbers typically require long exposure times, motion blur may cause greater loss of sharpness than the loss from diffraction. However, diffraction is a greater issue in close-up photography, and the tradeoff between DOF and overall sharpness can become quite noticeable as photographers are trying to maximise depth of field with very small apertures.\n\nHansma and Peterson have discussed determining the combined effects of defocus and diffraction using a root-square combination of the individual blur spots. Hansma's approach determines the f-number that will give the maximum possible sharpness; Peterson's approach determines the minimum f-number that will give the desired sharpness in the final image, and yields a maximum depth of field for which the desired sharpness can be achieved. In combination, the two methods can be regarded as giving a maximum and minimum f-number for a given situation, with the photographer free to choose any value within the range, as conditions (e.g., potential motion blur) permit. Gibson gives a similar discussion, additionally considering blurring effects of camera lens aberrations, enlarging lens diffraction and aberrations, the negative emulsion, and the printing paper. Couzin gave a formula essentially the same as Hansma's for optimal \"f\"-number, but did not discuss its derivation.\n\nHopkins, Stokseth, and Williams and Becklund have discussed the combined effects using the modulation transfer function.\n\nMany lenses include scales that indicate the DOF for a given focus distance and f-number; the 35 mm lens in the image is typical. That lens includes distance scales in feet and meters; when a marked distance is set opposite the large white index mark, the focus is set to that distance. The DOF scale below the distance scales includes markings on either side of the index that correspond to f-numbers. When the lens is set to a given f-number, the DOF extends between the distances that align with the f-number markings.\n\nPhotographers can use the lens scales to work backwards from the desired depth of field to find the necessary focus distance and aperture. For the 35 mm lens shown, if it were desired for the DOF to extend from 1 m to 2 m, focus would be set so that index mark was centered between the marks for those distances, and the aperture would be set to f/11.\n\nOn a view camera, the focus and f-number can be obtained by measuring the depth of field and performing simple calculations. Some view cameras include DOF calculators that indicate focus and f-number without the need for any calculations by the photographer.\n\nSome cameras have their hyperfocal distance marked on the focus dial. For example, on the Minox LX focusing dial there is a red dot between 2 m and infinity; when the lens is set at the red dot, that is, focused at the hyperfocal distance, the depth of field stretches from 2 m to infinity.\n\nThe DOF beyond the subject is always greater than the DOF in front of the subject. When the subject is at the hyperfocal distance or beyond, the far DOF is infinite, so the ratio is 1:∞; as the subject distance decreases, near:far DOF ratio increases, approaching unity at high magnification. For large apertures at typical portrait distances, the ratio is still close to 1:1.\n\nThis section covers some additional formula for evaluating depth of field; however they are all subject to significant simplifying assumptions: for example, they assume paraxial (Gaussian). They are suitable for practical photography, lens designers would use significantly more complex ones.\n\nFor given near and far DOF limits formula_2 and formula_3, the required f-number is smallest when focus is set to\n\nthe harmonic mean of the near and far distances. In practice, this is equivalent to the arithmetic mean for shallow depths of field. Sometimes, view camera users refer to the difference formula_5 as the \"focus spread\".\n\nIf a subject is at distance formula_6 and the foreground or background is at distance formula_7, let the distance between the subject and the foreground or background be indicated by\n\nThe blur disk diameter formula_9 of a detail at distance formula_10 from the subject can be expressed as a function of the subject magnification formula_11, focal length formula_12, f-number formula_13, or alternatively the aperture formula_14, according to\n\nThe minus sign applies to a foreground object, and the plus sign applies to a background object.\n\nThe blur increases with the distance from the subject; when formula_9 is less than the circule of confusion, the detail is within the depth of field.\n\nBULLET::::- Available as GIF images on the Large Format page.\n\nBULLET::::- Hummel, Rob (editor). 2001. \"American Cinematographer Manual\". 8th ed.

{"id": "8368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8368", "title": "Dumnonii", "text": "Dumnonii\n\nThe Dumnonii or Dumnones were a British tribe who inhabited Dumnonia, the area now known as Devon and Cornwall (and some areas of present-day Dorset and Somerset) in the further parts of the South West peninsula of Britain, from at least the Iron Age up to the early Saxon period. They were bordered to the east by the Durotriges tribe.\n\nWilliam Camden, in his 1607 edition of \"Britannia\", describes Cornwall and Devon as being two parts of the same 'country' which:\nCamden had learnt some Welsh during the course of his studies and it would appear that he is the origin of the interpretation of Dumnonii as \"deep valley dwellers\" from his understanding of the Welsh of his time. John Rhys later theorized that the tribal name was derived from the name of a goddess, \"Domnu\", probably meaning \"the goddess of the deep\". The proto-Celtic root *dubno- or *dumno- meaning \"the deep\" or \"the earth\" (or alternatively meaning \"dark\" or \"gloomy\") appears in personal names such as Dumnorix and Dubnovellaunus. Another group with a similar name but with no known links were the Fir Domnann of Connacht.\n\nThe Roman name of the town of Exeter, \"Isca Dumnoniorum\" (\"Isca of the Dumnonii\"), contains the root \"*iska-\" \"water\" for \"Water of the Dumnonii\". The Latin name suggests that the city was already an \"oppidum\", or walled town, on the banks on the River Exe before the foundation of the Roman city, in about AD 50. The Dumnonii gave their name to the English county of Devon, and their name is represented in Britain's two extant Brythonic languages as \"Dewnans\" in Cornish and \"Dyfnaint\" in Welsh. Amédée Thierry (\"Histoire des Gaulois\", 1828), one of the inventors of the \"historic race\" of Gauls, could confidently equate them with the Cornish (\"les Cornouailles\").\n\nVictorian historians often referred to the tribe as the Damnonii, which is also the name of another people from lowland Scotland, although there are no known links between the two populations.\n\nThe people of Dumnonia spoke a Southwestern Brythonic dialect similar to the forerunner of more recent Cornish and Breton. Irish immigrants, the Déisi, are evidenced by the Ogham-inscribed stones they have left behind, confirmed and supplemented by toponymical studies. The stones are sometimes inscribed in Latin, sometimes in both scripts. Tristram Risdon suggested the continuance of a Brythonic dialect in the South Hams, Devon, as late as the 14th century, in addition to its use in Cornwall.\n\nPtolemy's 2nd century \"Geography\" places the Dumnonii to the west of the Durotriges. The name \"purocoronavium\" that appears in the Ravenna Cosmography implies the existence of a sub-tribe called the Cornavii or Cornovii, perhaps the ancestors of the Cornish people.\n\nIn the sub-Roman period a Brythonic kingdom called Dumnonia emerged, covering the entire peninsula, although it is believed by some to have effectively been a collection of sub-kingdoms.\n\nA kingdom of Domnonée (and of Cornouaille alongside) was established in the province of Armorica directly across the English Channel, and has apparent links with the British population, suggesting an ancient connection of peoples along the western Atlantic seaboard.\n\nThe Latin name for Exeter is Isca Dumnoniorum (\"Water of the Dumnonii\"). This oppidum (a Latin term meaning an important town) on the banks of I River Exe certainly existed prior to the foundation of the Roman city in about AD 50. \"Isca\" is derived from the Brythonic word for flowing water, which was given to the River Exe. This is reflected in the Welsh name for Exeter: \"Caerwysg\" meaning \"fortified settlement on the river Uisc\".\n\nIsca Dumnoniorum originated with a settlement that developed around the Roman fortress of the Legio II Augusta and is one of the four \"poleis\" (cities) attributed to the tribe by Ptolemy. It is also listed in two routes of the late 2nd century Antonine Itinerary.\n\nA legionary bath-house was built inside the fortress sometime between 55 and 60 and underwent renovation shortly afterwards (c. 60-65) but by c. 68 (perhaps even 66) the legion had transferred to a newer fortress at Gloucester. This saw the dismantling of the Isca fortress, and the site was then abandoned. Around AD 75, work on the \"civitas forum\" and \"basilica\" had commenced on the site of the former \"principia\" and by the late 2nd century the \"civitas\" walls had been completed. They were 3 metres thick and 6 metres high and enclosed exactly the same area as the earlier fortress. However, by the late 4th century the \"civitas\" was in decline.\n\nAs well as Isca Dumnoniorum, Ptolemy's 2nd century \"Geography\" names three other towns:\nBULLET::::- Voliba, which remains unidentified,\nBULLET::::- Uxella, possibly on the River Axe, or at Launceston, and\nBULLET::::- Tamara, generally considered to be somewhere on the River Tamar.\n\nThe Ravenna Cosmography includes the last two names (in slightly different forms, as \"Tamaris\" and \"Uxelis\"), and adds several more names which may be settlements in the territory. These include:\nBULLET::::- Nemetostatio, a name relating to \"nemeton\", signifying \"sanctuary' or \"sacred grove\". Probably to be identified with North Tawton in Devon where there is a Roman earthwork that may be military, or possibly a tax collection station.\nBULLET::::- Purocoronavis, which may refer to an important native hill fort, such as Carn Brea or Tintagel. The name has led to speculation about the Cornish Cornovii.\n\nOther Romano-British sites in Dumnonia include:\nBULLET::::- Topsham, Devon - a settlement and harbour that served Isca Dumnoniorum to which it was connected by road and river.\nBULLET::::- Nanstallon (Cornwall) - a square military enclosure, seemingly associated with tin workings at nearby Boscarne.\nBULLET::::- Mount Batten (Devon) - an Iron Age tin port that continued into Roman times.\nBULLET::::- Plymouth (Devon) - evidence of a Roman settlement has been found on the north side of the harbour.\nBULLET::::- Ictis - an ancient port trading in tin.\n\nNew settlements continued to be built throughout the Roman period, including sites at Chysauster and Trevelgue Head. The style is native in form with no Romanised features. Near Padstow, a site of some importance that was inhabited from the late Bronze/early Iron Age to the mid 6th century now lies buried under the sands on the opposite side of the Camel estuary near St. Enodoc's Church, and may have been a western coastal equivalent of a Saxon Shore Fort. Byzantine and African pottery has been discovered at the site. At Magor Farm in Illogan, near Camborne, an archaeological site has been identified as being a villa.\n\nThe Dumnonii are thought to have occupied relatively isolated territory in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and possibly part of Dorset. Their cultural connections, as expressed in their ceramics, were with the peninsula of Armorica across the Channel, rather than with the southeast of Britain. They do not seem to have been politically centralised: coins are relatively rare, none of them locally minted, and the structure, distribution and construction of Bronze Age and Iron Age hill forts, \"rounds\" and defensible farmsteads in the south west point to a number of smaller tribal groups living alongside each other.\n\nDumnonia is noteworthy for its many settlements that have survived from the Romano-British period, but also for its lack of a villa system. Local archaeology has revealed instead the isolated enclosed farmsteads known locally as \"rounds\". These seem to have survived the Roman abandonment of Britain, but were subsequently replaced, in the 6th and 7th centuries, by the unenclosed farms taking the Brythonic toponymic \"tre-\".\n\nAs in most other Brythonic areas, Iron Age hill forts, such as Hembury Castle, were refortified for the use of chieftains or kings. Other high-status settlements such as Tintagel seem to have been reconstructed during this period. Post-Roman imported pottery has been excavated from many sites across the region, and the apparent surge in late 5th century Mediterranean and/or Byzantine imports is yet to be explained satisfactorily.\n\nApart from fishing and agriculture, the main economic resource of the Dumnonii was tin mining. The area of Dumnonia had been mined since ancient times, and the tin was exported from the ancient trading port of Ictis (St Michael's Mount). Tin extraction (mainly by streaming) had existed here from the early Bronze Age around the 22nd century BC. West Cornwall, around Mount's Bay, was traditionally thought to have been visited by metal traders from the eastern Mediterranean\n\nDuring the first millennium BC trade became more organised, first with the Phoenicians, who settled Gades (Cadiz) around 1100 BC, and later with the Greeks, who had settled Massilia (Marseilles) and Narbo (Narbonne) around 600 BC. Smelted Cornish tin was collected at Ictis whence it was conveyed across the Bay of Biscay to the mouth of the Loire and then to Gades via the Loire and Rhone valleys. It went then through the Mediterranean Sea in ships to Gades.\n\nDuring the period c. 500-450 BC, the tin deposits seem to have become more important, and fortified settlements appear such as at Chun Castle and Kenidjack Castle, to protect both the tin smelters and mines.\n\nThe earliest account of Cornish tin mining was written by Pytheas of Massilia late in the 4th century BC after his circumnavigation of the British Isles. Underground mining was described in this account, although it cannot be determined when it had started. Pytheas's account was noted later by other writers including Pliny the Elder and Diodorus Siculus.\n\nIt is likely that tin trade with the Mediterranean was later on under the control of the Veneti. Britain was one of the places proposed for the \"Cassiterides\", that is Tin Islands. Tin working continued throughout Roman occupation although it appears that output declined because of new supplies brought in from the deposits discovered in Iberia (Spain and Portugal). However, when these supplies diminished, production in Dumnonia increased and appears to have reached a peak during the 3rd century AD.\n\nThe Sub-Roman or Post-Roman history of Dumnonia comes from a variety of sources and is considered exceedingly difficult to interpret given that historical fact, legend and confused pseudo-history are compounded by a variety of sources in Middle Welsh and Latin. The main sources available for discussion of this period include Gildas's \"De Excidio Britanniae\" and Nennius's \"Historia Brittonum\", the \"Annales Cambriae\", \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta Regum Anglorum\" and \"De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Ecclesiae\", along with texts from the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\" and the \"Red Book of Hergest\", and Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" as well as \"The Descent of the Men of the North\" (\"Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd\", in Peniarth MS 45 and elsewhere) and the \"Book of Baglan\".\n\nBULLET::::- Cornovii (details of the three tribes bearing the name)\nBULLET::::- Damnonii (tribe in central Scotland)\nBULLET::::- Dark Ages (historiography)\n\nBULLET::::- Ptolemy. \"Geography\"\nBULLET::::- Piguet, Marie-France. \"Observation et histoire: Race chez Amédée Thierry et William F.

{"id": "8373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8373", "title": "Drag racing", "text": "Drag racing\n\nDrag racing is a type of motor racing in which automobiles or motorcycles (usually specially prepared for the purpose) compete, usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line. The race follows a short, straight course from a standing start over a measured distance, most commonly , with a shorter () becoming increasingly popular, as it has become the standard for Top Fuel dragsters and funny cars, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies have adopted it as the standard, while the is also popular in some circles. Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s.\n\nThe history of automobiles and motorcycles being used for drag racing is nearly as long as the history of motorized vehicles themselves, and has taken the form of both illegal street racing, and as an organized and regulated motorsport. This article covers the legal sport.\n\nPush starts to get engines running were necessary until the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) mandated self-starters in 1976. After burnouts, cars would be pushed back by crews; this persisted until NHRA required reversing systems in 1980. Don Garlits was the first to do burnouts across the starting line, which is now standard practise. Each driver then backs up to and stages at the starting line.\n\nBefore each race (commonly known as a pass), each driver is allowed to perform a burnout, which heats the driving tires and lays rubber down at the beginning of the track, improving traction. The cars run through a \"water box\" (formerly a \"bleach box\", before bleach was replaced by flammable traction compound, which produced spectacular, and dangerous, flame burnouts; the hazard led NHRA to mandate use of water in the 1970s).\n\nModern races are started electronically by a system known as a \"Christmas tree\", which consists of a column of lights for each driver/lane, and two light beam sensors per lane on the track at the starting line. Current NHRA trees, for example, feature one blue light (split into halves), then three amber, one green, and one red. When the first light beam is broken by a vehicle's front tire(s), the vehicle is \"pre-staged\" (approximately from the starting line), and the pre-stage indicator on the tree is lit. When the second light beam is broken, the vehicle is \"staged\", and the stage indicator on the tree is lit. Vehicles may then leave the pre-stage beam, but must remain in the stage beam until the race starts.\n\nOnce one competitor is staged, their opponent has a set amount of time to stage or they will be instantly disqualified, indicated by a red light on the tree. Otherwise, once both drivers are staged, the system chooses a short delay at random (to prevent a driver being able to anticipate the start), then starts the race. The light sequence at this point varies slightly. For example, in NHRA Professional classes, three amber lights on the tree flash simultaneously, followed 0.4 seconds later by a green light (this is also known as a \"pro tree\"). In NHRA Sportsman classes, the amber lights illuminate in sequence from top to bottom, 0.5 seconds apart, followed 0.5 seconds later by the green light (this is also known as a \"sportsman tree\" or \"full tree\"). If a vehicle leaves the starting line before the green light illuminates, the red light for that lane illuminates instead, and the driver is disqualified (also known as \"red lighting\"). In a handicap start, the green light automatically lights up for the first driver, and the red light is only lit in the proper lane after both cars have launched if one driver leaves early, or if both drivers left early, the driver whose reaction time is worse (if one lane has a -.015 and the other lane has a -.022, the lane of the driver who committed a 0.022 is given the red light after both cars have left), as a red light infraction is only assessed to the driver with the worse infraction, if both drivers leave early. Even if both drivers leave early, the green light is automatically lit for the driver that left last, and they still may win the pass (as in the 2014 NHRA Auto Club Pro Stock final, Erica Enders-Stevens and Jason Line both committed red light infractions; only Line was assessed with a red light, as he was -.011 versus Enders-Stevens' -.002).\n\nSeveral measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the green light illuminating to the vehicle leaving the staging beams or breaking the guard beam. Elapsed time is the period from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a speed trap covering the final to the finish line, indicating average speed of the vehicle in that distance.\n\nExcept where a breakout rule is in place, the winner is the first vehicle to cross the finish line, and therefore the driver with the lowest combined reaction time and elapsed time. Because these times are measured separately, a driver with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's advantage in reaction time exceeds the elapsed time difference. In heads-up racing, this is known as a \"holeshot win\". In categories where a breakout rule is in effect (for example, NHRA Junior Dragster, Super Comp, Super Gas, Super Stock, and Stock classes, as well as some dial-in classes), if a competitor is faster than his or her predetermined time (a \"breakout\"), that competitor loses. If both competitors are faster than their predetermined times, the competitor who breaks out by less time wins. Regardless, a red light foul is worse than a breakout, except in Junior Dragster where exceeding the absolute limit is a cause for disqualification.\n\nMost race events use a traditional bracket system, where the losing car and driver are eliminated from the event while the winner advances to the next round, until a champion is crowned. Events can range from 16 to over 100 car brackets. Drivers are typically seeded by elapsed times in qualifying. In bracket racing without a breakout (such as NHRA Competition Eliminator), pairings are based on times compared to their index (faster than index for class is better). In bracket racing with a breakout (Stock, Super Stock, but also the NHRA's Super classes), the closest to the index is favourable.\n\nA popular alternative to the standard eliminations format is the Chicago Style format (also called the Three Round format in Australia), named for the US 30 Dragstrip in suburban Gary, Indiana where a midweek meet featured this format. All entered cars participate in one qualifying round, and then are paired for the elimination round. The two fastest times among winners from this round participate in the championship round. Depending on the organisation, the next two fastest times may play for third, then fifth, and so forth, in consolation rounds. Currently, an IHRA 400 Thunder championship race in Australia uses the format.\n\nThe standard distance of a drag race is 1,320 feet, 402 m, or 1/4 mile. However, due to safety concerns, certain sanctioning bodies (notably the NHRA for its Top Fuel and Funny Car classes) have shortened races to 1,000 feet. Some drag strips are even shorter and run 660 feet, 201 m, or 1/8 mile. The 1,000 foot distance is now also popular with bracket racing, especially in meets where there are 1/8 mile cars and 1/4 mile cars racing together, and is used by the revived American Drag Racing League for its primary classes (not Jr Dragster). Some organisations that deal with Pro Modified and \"Mountain Motor\" Pro Stock cars (Professional Drag Racers Association) use the 1/8 mile distance, even if the tracks are 1/4 mile tracks.\n\nThe National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) oversees the majority of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization is the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA). Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other.\n\nBesides NHRA and IHRA, there are niche organizations for muscle cars and nostalgia vehicles. The Nostalgia Drag Racing League (NDRL) based in Brownsburg, IN, runs a series of 1/4 mile (402m) drag races in the Midwest for 1979 and older nostalgic appearing cars, with four classes of competition running in an index system. Pro 7.0 and Pro 7.50 run heads up 200 mile per hour (320 kilometre per hour) passes, while Pro Comp and Pro Gas run 8.0 to 10.0 indices. NDRL competition vehicles typically include Front Engine Dragsters, Altereds, Funny Cars, early Pro Stock clones, Super Stocks and Gassers.\n\nThe National Electric Drag Racing Association (NEDRA) races electric vehicles against high performance gasoline-powered vehicles such as Dodge Vipers or classic muscle cars in 1/4 and 1/8 mile (402m & 201m) races. The current electric drag racing record is 6.940 seconds at 201.37 mph (324.0736 km/h) for a quarter mile (402m). Another niche organization is the VWDRC which run a VW-only championship with vehicles running under 7 seconds.\n\nPrior to the founding of the NHRA and IHRA, smaller organizations sanctioned drag racing in the early years, which included the competing AHRA in the United States from 1955 to 2005.\n\nThe first Australian Nationals event was run in 1965 at Riverside raceway, near Melbourne. The Australian National Drag Racing Association (ANDRA) was established in 1973, and today they claim they are the \"best in the world outside the United States\". ANDRA sanctions races throughout Australia and throughout the year at all levels, from Junior Dragster to Top Fuel.\n\nThe ANDRA Drag Racing Series is for professional drivers and riders and includes Top Fuel, Top Alcohol, Top Doorslammer (similar to the USA Pro Modified class), Pro Stock (using 400 cubic inch engines (6.5 litres)), Top Bike and Pro Stock Motorcycle.\n\nThe Summit Sportsman Series is for ANDRA sportsman drivers and riders and includes Competition, Super Stock, Super Compact, Competition Bike, Supercharged Outlaws, Top Sportsman, Modified, Super Sedan, Modified Bike, Super Street and Junior Dragster.\n\nIn 2015, after a dispute with ANDRA, Sydney Dragway, Willowbank Raceway and the Perth Motorplex invited the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) to sanction events at their tracks. Since then the Perth Motorplex has reverted to an ANDRA sanction and Springmount Raceway has embraced the IHRA umbrella. The 400 Thunder Series now attracts professional racers to its races at Sydney Dragway and Willowbank Raceway and is the premiere series in Australia.\n\nCommunications provider OVO Mobile provides a live stream of all 400 Thunder Australian Professional Drag Racing Series events to fans globally. The 400 Thunder Series is aired on SBS Speedweek.\n\nDrag racing was imported to Europe by American NATO troops during the Cold War. Races were held in West Germany beginning in the 1960s at the airbases at Ramstein and Sembach and in the UK at various airstrips and racing circuits before the opening of Europe's first permanent drag strip at Santa Pod Raceway in 1966.\n\nThe FIA organises a Europe-wide four wheeled championship for the Top Fuel, Top Methanol Dragster, Top Methanol Funny Car, Pro Modified and Pro Stock classes. FIM Europe organises a similar championship for bike classes. In addition, championships are run for sportsman classes in many countries throughout Europe by the various national motorsport governing bodies.\n\nDrag racing in New Zealand started in the 1960s. The New Zealand Hot Rod Association (NZHRA) sanctioned what is believed to have been the first drag meeting at an open cut coal mine at Kopuku, south of Auckland, sometime in 1966. In 1973, the first and only purpose built drag strip opened in Meremere by the Pukekohe Hot Rod Club. In April 1993 the governance of drag racing was separated from the NZHRA and the New Zealand Drag Racing Association (NZDRA) was formed. In 2014, New Zealand's second purpose built drag strip – Masterton Motorplex – opened.\n\nThe first New Zealand Drag Racing Nationals was held in the 1966/67 season at Kopuku, near Auckland.\n\nThere are now two governing bodies operating drag racing in New Zealand with the Florida-based International Hot Rod Association sanctioning both of New Zealands major tracks at Ruapuna (Pegasus Bay Drag Racing Association) in the South Island and Meremere Dragway Inc in the North Island. However, the official ASN of the sport, per FIA regulations, is the New Zealand Drag Racing Association.\n\nMany countries in South America race 200 meters, unlike in the United States and Australia, where 400 meters or 1/4 mile is typical.\n\nOrganized drag racing in Colombia is the responsibility of Club G3, a private organization. The events take place at Autódromo de Tocancipá.\n\nCuraçao\n\nOn the island of Curaçao, organization of drag racing events is handled by the Curaçao Autosport Foundation (FAC)\nAll racing events, including street legal competitions, happen at the Curaçao International Raceway.\n\n'Aruba'\n\nOn the island of Aruba all racing events, including street legal competitions, happen at Palomarga international raceway.\n\nBarbados\n\nOn the island of Barbados, organization of drag racing events is done by the Barbados Association of Dragsters and Drifters. Currently the drag racing is done at Bushy Park racing circuit over 1/8 mile, while \"acceleration tests\" of 1/4 mile are done at the Paragon military base.\n\nSaint Lucia\n\nOn the Island of Saint Lucia, organization of drag racing events is done by Time Line Events, currently races are held at the US Old military base also known as the \"Ca Ca Beff\", \"The Base\" near the Hewanorra International Airport in Vieux Fort.\n\nDominican Republic\n\nOn Santo Domingo, organization of drag racing events is done by Autodromo Sunix and they happen at the Autodromo Sunix, close to the Airport SDQ.\n\nOrganized drag racing is rapidly growing in India. The country's first drag race meet was organized by \"Autocar India\" in Mumbai in 2002. Since then there have been many drag racing events in India. The most popular event is Elite Octanes' Valley Run which is held at Ambey Valley air strip in Loanavla every year. \n\nThe biggest drag series event was organized by India Speed Week with three different locations around India. After the series two riders were chosen to represent the country 2017 initiative to bring 11 times world drag racing champion Rickey Gadson to India. The initiative was executed during the Valley Run 2017 event, which gave the participants a platform to perform at the highest level globally. Rickey Gadson, as an extension of the initiative invited two of the top performing drag racers to visit USA to train and get an opportunity to represent India at the World Finals of drag racing held on 16-18 November 2018 in Valdosta GA, USA.\nAs a result the two riders performed in their maiden event outside India. Also during the event, Amit Sharma, the fastest drag racer in Indian drag racing history, produced a time slip of 8.87 sec's – the fastest ever by any Indian.\n\nDrag racing is also gaining popularity in Pakistan, with private organizations sponsoring such events. The Bahria Town housing project recently organized a drag racing event in Rawalpindi with the help of some of the country's best drivers.\n\n[[Sri Lanka]] has seen an immense growth in drag racing due to legal meets held by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club, an FIA sanctioned body. In recent years, exotic cars and Japanese power houses have been taking part in these popular events.\n\nDrag racing is an established sport in South Africa, with a number of strips around the country including [[Tarlton International Raceway]] and ODI Raceway. Drag racing is controlled by Motorsport South Africa and all drivers are required to hold a valid Motorsport South Africa license. Drivers can compete in a number of categories including Top Eliminator, Senior Eliminator, Super Competition Eliminator, Competition Eliminator, Pro Street Bikes, Superbike Eliminator, Supersport Shootout (motorcycle), Street Modified, and Factory Stock.\n\n[[Image:Caterpiller-sponsored dragster.jpgthumbrightCaterpillar-sponsored dragster. Note wide slicks and high-mounted wing, to assist traction.]]\n\nThere are hundreds of classes in drag racing, each with different requirements and restrictions on things such as weight, engine size, body style, modifications, and many others. [[NHRA]] and [[International Hot Rod AssociationIHRA]] share some of these classes, but many are solely used by one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA boasts over 200 classes, while the IHRA has fewer. Some IHRA classes have multiple sub-classes in them to differentiate by engine components and other features. There is even a class for aspiring youngsters, [[Junior Dragster]], which typically uses an eighth-mile track, also favored by VW racers.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Fédération Internationale de l'AutomobileFIA]] (cars) and [[Union Européenne de MotocyclismeUEM]] (bikes) began sanctioning drag racing in Europe with a fully established European Drag Racing Championship, in cooperation (and rules compliance) with NHRA. The major European drag strips include Santa Pod Raceway in Podington, England; Alastaro Circuit, Finland; [[Mantorp Park]], Sweden; Gardermoen Raceway, Norway and the [[Hockenheimring]] in Germany.\n\n[[Image:'Pain Killer' jr. dragster.JPGthumb\"Pain Killer\" J/D. Note the driver, helmet off, is still in the car, which is under tow on the return road, headed for the pits.]]\n\nThere is a somewhat arbitrary definition of what constitutes a \"professional\" class. The NHRA includes 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, Pro Modified and Pro Stock Motorcycle. The FIA features a different set of 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Top Methanol Dragster, Top Methanol Funny Car, Pro Modified and Pro Stock. Other sanctioning bodies have similarly different definitions. A partial list of classes includes:\n\n[[File:Top Fuel.JPGthumbTop Fuel dragsters]]\nBULLET::::- [[Top Fuel]] Dragster (TF/D). The dragsters, or \"diggers\", are the fastest class. Among the fastest-accelerating machines in the world, these cars can cover the dragstrip in less than 3.7 seconds and record trap speeds over . Modern Top Fuel dragsters are long and weigh in race-ready trim. Methanol mixed with up to 90% [[nitromethane]] is used as fuel.\n\nBULLET::::- Top Fuel [[Funny Car]] (TF/FC) Similar to their dragster counterparts but with a shorter wheelbase and a carbon-fiber body that loosely resembles a production-based automobile, Funny Cars, or “floppers,” routinely run in the 4.0s and can exceed 315 mph. In 2017 NHRA driver [[Robert Hight]] ran a career best ET. 3.793 and speed of 339.87 mph.\n\n[[File:Pro Stock.JPGthumbA typical Pro Stock car.]]\nBULLET::::- [[Pro Stock]] (NHRA, IHRA/MMPSA) Often called “factory hot rods” because of their resemblance to production-based cars (and because they must maintain a relatively stock appearance), and commonly known as \"doorslammers\", Pro Stockers can record quarter-mile times in the 6.4 second range, and speeds over . They can rev to more than 10,500 rpm and make in excess of . NHRA engines can be no more than [[Engine displacementdisplacement]] while MMPSA cars can run a maximum of (called \"Mountain Motors\"). IHRA engines can be no more than . Both classes require the motors to be naturally aspirated.\nBULLET::::- [[Pro Stock Motorcycle]] (NHRA and IHRA) These highly modified vehicles, which can run under 6.8 seconds at more than 195 mph, feature a purpose-built tube chassis and a lightweight, aerodynamically enhanced replica of original bodywork.\nBULLET::::- [[Pro Modified]] (Pro Mod). Known as [[Top Doorslammer]] in Australia. Some engine restrictions, very high power. Cars can run superchargers, turbochargers, or nitrous oxide. Cars running blowers are limited to while cars with nitrous can run up to . This class is globally recognised, although the name differs between North America and Australia.\nBULLET::::- [[Top Alcohol Dragster]] (TA/D). Known as Top Methanol Dragster in FIA competition. Top Alcohol Dragsters resemble Top Fuelers, but have significant differences. They may use a supercharged methanol-burning engine or an injected nitromethane combination. They can run in the 5.1s at more than 280 mph.\nBULLET::::- [[Top Alcohol Funny Car]] (TA/FC). Known as Top Methanol Funny Car in FIA competition. Similar in physical appearance to their nitro-burning Funny Car counterparts, Top Alcohol Funny Cars are restricted to the use of methanol fuel and have three-speed transmissions. They can run in the 5.4s at more than 265 mph. In the IHRA, Alcohol Funny Car is the fifth pro category, replacing NHRA's Pro Stock Bike.\n\nBULLET::::- [[Competition Eliminator]] This is the NHRA class with the most variety. Each of its 88 sections is assigned an index based on what a well-built car should run, and races are handicapped according to those indexes.\nBULLET::::- [[Outlaw Series]]\nBULLET::::- [[Pro FWD]]\nBULLET::::- [[Sport Front-Wheel-Drive]] (SFWD) This is a class that is dedicated to solely front wheel drive vehicles. One of the motivations behind the creation of this class was to keep cars as original looking as they could possibly be. SFWD is one of the most common and popular import drag racing classes. The two most common vehicles in this class are the Honda Civic and the Acura Integra. In this class, the number one restriction is that each vehicle must retain its original chassis. No modification to the OEM floorboard or Firewall is permitted. In addition, at least one headlight and both brake lights must be fully functional. Suspension and brake modifications are allowed to a certain extent. Aftermarket components are permitted as long as the original mounting points are not modified. All four brakes must be retained and parachutes are permitted. The stock dashboard and windshield must be retained along with the car's original interior from the front seats forward, while rear seats as well as passenger-side seat may be removed. Racing gas or E85 may be used; methanol may not. Internal engine modifications of all types, aftermarket engine blocks, and engine swaps are permitted. Engines may use nitrous oxide or be turbocharged. Tires may be a maximum of tall and in tread width. All cars must meet a minimum weight requirement of , plus any weight penalties teams may incur for having certain equipment installed that would have given them too much of an advantage over the competition.\nBULLET::::- [[Stick Shift]] Reserved for vehicles with a [[Manual transmission]]. The rising popularity of automatic transmissions in drag racing created the demand for these classes. Popular sanctioning bodies include United Manual Transmission Racers, Pro Stick Racing, Rocky Mountain Stick Shifters, and Ozark Mountain Super Shifters.\nBULLET::::- [[Super Comp]]/[[Quick Rod]] The quickest of the heads-up Super classes (8.90 index) is composed primarily of dragsters. Most cars are capable of running well under the index but use electronic aids to run close to it without breaking out.\n\nBULLET::::- [[Super Gas]]/[[Super Rod]] Super Gas entries, which run on a 9.90 index, are primarily full-bodied cars and street roadsters. No dragsters or altereds are permitted. As in Super Comp, competitors use electronic aids to run as close to the class standard without going under.\nBULLET::::- [[Super Street]]/[[Hot Rod (drag racing class)Hot Rod]] Racers compete on a fixed 10.90 index. All vehicles must be full-bodied cars and weigh no less than 2,800 pounds except for six-cylinder cars (2,000) and four-cylinder and rotary-powered cars (1,200). Engine and chassis modifications are virtually unlimited.\n\n[[File:Super Street Mustang.JPGthumbSuper Street Mustang]]\nBULLET::::- [[Super Stock]] Super Stock vehicles resemble ordinary passenger cars, but are actually heavily modified. Entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower and compete on indexes. The breakout rule is enforced.\nBULLET::::- [[Stock (drag racing class)Stock]] Stock cars are similar to Super Stockers, but rules regarding everything from engine modifications to body alterations are much stricter. Virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower.\nBULLET::::- [[Sport Compact]]\nBULLET::::- Top Sportsman (NHRA, IHRA, ANDRA) Competitors in these full-bodied entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.99 seconds. Full Tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than .\n\nBULLET::::- Top Dragster (T/D) (NHRA, IHRA, ANDRA) Competitors in these open-wheel entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.70 seconds. Full tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than . Cars can run any combination of motor: blown, turbo, nitrous or just all motor.\nBULLET::::- Top Fuel Funny Bike (high performance 5 second bikes)\nBULLET::::- [[Nostalgia Super Stock]]\nBULLET::::- NHRA and ANDRA [[Summit Racing]] series Super Pro, Pro, and bike.\nBULLET::::- Junior Dragster (racers between the ages of 8 and 18 may race a half scale version of the sport's fastest car, Top Fuel Dragster. Juniors run as follows: 12.90-slower for 8-9 year olds, 10-12 year olds at 8.90, and 13-18 year olds 7.90 and slower at a top speed of 85 mph). These cars race at 1/8 mile or 1/16 mile.\nBULLET::::- NHRA new class for Juniors is JR COMP running 6.90s at a top speed of (1/8 mile or 1/16 mile).\nA complete listing of all classes can be found on the respective NHRA and IHRA official websites.\n\n[[Image:Dragster engine.jpgthumbleftDragster engine with dual-plug heads, dual ignition magnetos, and intake snorkel]]\n\nThe UEM also has a different structure of professional categories with Top Fuel Bike, Super Twin Top Fuel Bike, and Pro Stock Bike contested, leaving the entire European series with a total of 8 professional categories.\n\nTo allow different cars to compete against each other, some competitions are raced on a handicap basis, with faster cars delayed on the starting line enough to theoretically even things up with the slower car. This may be based on rule differences between the cars in stock, super stock, and modified classes, or on a competitor's chosen \"dial-in\" in [[bracket racing]].\n\nFor a list of drag racing [[world record]]s in each class, see [[Dragstrip#Quarter mile times]].\n\nA 'dial-in' is a time the driver estimates it will take his or her car to cross the finish line, and is generally displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the starting lights on the tree accordingly. The slower car will then get a [[Head start (positioning)head start]] equal to the difference in the two dial-ins, so if both cars perform perfectly, they would cross the finish line dead even. If either car goes faster than its dial-in (called breaking out), it is disqualified regardless of who has the lower elapsed time; if both cars break out, the one who breaks out by the smallest amount wins. However, if a driver had jump-started (red light) or crossed a boundary line, both violations override any break out (except in some classes with an absolute break out rule such as Junior classes).\n\nThe effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed, in that victory goes to the driver able to precisely predict elapsed time, whether it is fast or slow. This in turn makes victory much less dependent on budget, and more dependent on skill, making it popular with casual weekend racers.\n\n[[File:Blazing Angel Jet Dragster.jpgthumbBlazing Angel Jet Dragster]]\n\nThe [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) was founded in 1951, to take illegal racing off the [[Street racingstreet]].\n\nThe organization banned the use of [[nitromethane]] in 1957, calling it unsafe, in part through the efforts of [[C. J. Hart (drag racing)C. J.

{"id": "8375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8375", "title": "Draugr", "text": "Draugr\n\nThe draugr or draug (, plural ; modern , and Danish, Swedish, and ) is an undead creature from Norse mythology, also called , literally \"again-walker\" ().\n\nThe word \"draugr\" can be traced to a Proto-Indo European stem \"*\" \"phantom\", from \"*\" \"deceive\" (see also Avestan \"druj\").\nThe Old Norse meaning of the word is a revenant. In Swedish, \"draug\" is a modern loanword from West Norse, as the native Swedish form \"drög\" has acquired the meaning of \"a pale, ineffectual, and slow-minded person that drags himself along\".\n\nThe will appears to be strong, strong enough to draw the \"hugr\" [animate will] back to one's body. These reanimated individuals were known as \"draugar\". However, though the dead might live again, they could also die again. \"Draugar\" die a \"second death\" as Chester Gould calls it, when their bodies decay, are burned, dismembered or otherwise destroyed.\n\nDraugar live in their graves, often guarding treasure buried with them in their burial mound. They are animated corpses with a corporeal body, unlike ghosts, with similar physical abilities as in life. Older literature makes clear distinctions between sea-draugar and land-draugar.\n\nDraugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. According to Gregg Smith, \"The appearance of a \"draugr\" was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at.\" They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic mythology which appear to retain some semblance of intelligence. They exist to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who wronged them in life. The draugr's ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf of Eyrbyggja saga was \"uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about him… swollen to the size of an ox,\" and his body was so heavy that it could not be raised without levers. They are also noted for the ability to rise from the grave as wisps of smoke and \"swim\" through solid rock. \n\nIn folklore, draugar slay their victims through various methods including crushing them with their enlarged forms, devouring their flesh, devouring them whole in their enlarged forms, indirectly killing them by driving them mad, and by drinking their blood. Animals feeding near the grave of a draugr might be driven mad by the creature's influence. They may also die from being driven mad. Thorolf, for example, caused birds to drop dead when they flew over his bowl barrow.\n\nThe draugr's victims were not limited to trespassers in its home. The roaming undead devastated livestock by running the animals to death either by riding them or pursuing them in some hideous, half-flayed form. Shepherds' duties kept them outdoors at night, and they were particular targets for the hunger and hatred of the undead:\nDraugar are noted for having numerous magical abilities (referred to as \"trollskap\") resembling those of living witches and wizards, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future. A draugr can change into a seal, a great flayed bull, a grey horse with a broken back but no ears or tail, and a cat that would sit upon a sleeper's chest and grow steadily heavier until the victim suffocated. The draugr Þráinn (Thrain) shape-shifted into a cat-like creature (\"kattakyn\") in \"Hrómundar saga Gripssonar\":\nDraugar have the ability to enter into the dreams of the living, and they will frequently leave a gift behind so that \"the living person may be assured of the tangible nature of the visit\". Draugar also have the ability to curse a victim, as shown in the Grettis saga, where Grettir is cursed to be unable to become any stronger. Draugar also brought disease to a village and could create temporary darkness in daylight hours. They preferred to be active during the night, although it did not appear to be vulnerable to sunlight like some other revenants. Draugr can also kill people with bad luck.\n\nA draugr's presence might be shown by a great light that glowed from the mound like foxfire. This fire would form a barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead. The draugr could also move magically through the earth, swimming through solid stone as does Killer-Hrapp:\n\nSome draugar are immune to weapons, and only a hero has the strength and courage needed to stand up to so formidable an opponent. In legends, the hero would often have to wrestle the draugr back to his grave, thereby defeating him, since weapons would do no good. A good example of this is found in \"Hrómundar saga Gripssonar\". Iron could injure a draugr, as is the case with many supernatural creatures, although it would not be sufficient to stop it. Sometimes the hero is required to dispose of the body in unconventional ways. The preferred method is to cut off the draugr's head, burn the body, and dump the ashes in the sea—the emphasis being on making absolutely sure that the draugr was dead and gone.\n\nThe draugar were said to be either \"hel-blár\" (\"death-blue\") or \"nár-fölr\" (\"corpse-pale\"). The death-blue color was not actually grey but was a dark blue or maroon hue which covered the entire body. Glámr, the undead shepherd of \"Grettis saga\", was reported to be dark blue, and Laxdæla saga describes how bones were dug up belonging to a dead sorceress who had appeared in dreams, and they were \"blue and evil looking.\"\n\nThe resting place of the draugr was a tomb which they were able to leave during the night to visit the living. Such visits are supposed to be horrible events that often end in death for one or more of the living, which would then warrant the exhumation of the draugr by a hero.\n\nThe draugr's motivation was primarily jealousy and greed. Greed causes it to viciously attack any would-be grave robbers, but the draugr also expresses an innate jealousy of the living stemming from a longing for the things of life which it once had. They also exhibit an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, as shown in the encounter of Aran and Asmund, sword brothers who made an oath that, if one should die, the other would sit vigil with him for three days inside the burial mound. When Aran died, Asmund brought his own possessions into the barrow—banners, armor, hawk, hound, and horse—then set himself to wait the three days:\n\nThe main indication that a deceased person will become a draugr is that the corpse is not in a horizontal position but is found in an upright or sitting position, indicating that the dead might return. Any mean, nasty, or greedy person can become a draugr. As Ármann notes, \"most medieval Icelandic ghosts are evil or marginal people. If not dissatisfied or evil, they are unpopular\".\n\nTraditionally, a pair of open iron scissors was placed on the chest of the recently deceased, and straws or twigs might be hidden among their clothes. The big toes were tied together or needles were driven through the soles of the feet in order to keep the dead from being able to walk. Tradition also held that the coffin should be lifted and lowered in three different directions as it was carried from the house to confuse a possible draugr's sense of direction.\n\nThe most effective means of preventing the return of the dead was believed to be a corpse door, a special door through which the corpse was carried feet-first with people surrounding it so that the corpse couldn't see where it was going. The door was then bricked up to prevent a return. It is speculated that this belief began in Denmark and spread throughout the Norse culture, founded on the idea that the dead could only leave through the way they entered.\n\nIn \"Eyrbyggja saga\", draugar are driven off by holding a \"door-doom\". One by one, they are summoned to the door-doom and given judgment and forced out of the home by this legal method. The home was then purified with holy water to ensure that they never came back.\n\nA variation of the draugr is the \"haugbui\" (from Old Norse \"haugr\"' \"howe, barrow, tumulus\") which was a mound-dweller, the dead body living on within its tomb. The notable difference between the two was that the haugbui is unable to leave its grave site and only attacks those who trespass upon their territory.\n\nThe haugbui was rarely found far from its burial place and is a type of undead commonly found in Norse sagas. The creature is said to either swim alongside boats or sail around them in a partially submerged vessel, always on their own. In some accounts, witnesses portray them as shapeshifters who take on the appearance of seaweed or moss-covered stones on the shoreline.\n\nOne of the best-known draugar is Glámr, who is defeated by the hero in \"Grettis saga\". After Glámr dies on Christmas Eve, \"people became aware that Glámr was not resting in peace. He wrought such havoc that some people fainted at the sight of him, while others went out of their minds\". After a battle, Grettir eventually gets Glámr on his back. Just before Grettir kills him, Glámr curses Grettir because \"Glámr was endowed with more evil force than most other ghosts\", and thus he was able to speak and leave Grettir with his curse after his death.\n\nA somewhat ambivalent, alternative view of the draugr is presented by the example of Gunnar Hámundarson in \"Njáls saga\": \"It seemed as though the howe was agape, and that Gunnar had turned within the howe to look upwards at the moon. They thought that they saw four lights within the howe, but not a shadow to be seen. Then they saw that Gunnar was merry, with a joyful face.\"\n\nIn the \"Eyrbyggja saga\", a shepherd is assaulted by a blue-black draugr. The shepherd's neck is broken during the ensuing scuffle. The shepherd rises the next night as a draugr.\n\nIn more recent Scandinavian folklore, the draug (the modern spelling used in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) is often identified with the spirits of mariners drowned at sea. The creature is said to possess a distinctly human form, with the exception that its head is composed entirely of seaweed. In other tellings, the draug is described as being a headless fisherman, dressed in oilskin and sailing in half a boat (the Norwegian municipality of Bø, Nordland has the half-boat in its coat-of-arms). This trait is common in the northernmost part of Norway, where life and culture was based on fishing more than anywhere else. The reason for this may be that the fishermen often drowned in great numbers, and the stories of restless dead coming in from sea were more common in the north than any other region of the country.\n\nA recorded legend from Trøndelag tells how a cadaver lying on a beach became the object of a quarrel between the two types of draug (headless and seaweed-headed). A similar source even tells of a third type, the \"gleip\", known to hitch themselves to sailors walking ashore and make them slip on the wet rocks.\n\nBut, though the draug usually presages death, there is an amusing account in Northern Norway of a northerner who managed to outwit him:\n\nThe modern and popular connection between the draug and the sea can be traced back to authors like Jonas Lie and Regine Nordmann, whose works include several books of fairy tales, as well as the drawings of Theodor Kittelsen, who spent some years living in Svolvær. Up north, the tradition of sea-draugs is especially vivid.\n\nArne Garborg describes land-draugs coming fresh from the graveyards, and the term \"draug\" is even used of vampires. The notion of draugs who live in the mountains is present in the poetic works of Henrik Ibsen (\"Peer Gynt\"), and Aasmund Olavsson Vinje. The Nynorsk translation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" used the term for both Nazgûl and the dead men of Dunharrow. Tolkien's Barrow-Wights bear obvious similarity to, and were inspired by the haugbui. In the video game \"\", draugr are the undead skeletal remains of fallen warriors that inhabit the ancient burial sites of a Nordic-inspired race of man. Draugr are a common enemy, the first encountered by the player, in the 2018 video game \"God of War\", with a variety of different powers and abilities.\n\nThe exoplanet PSR B1257+12 A has been named \"Draugr\".\n\nBULLET::::- Gjenganger\nBULLET::::- Norse funeral\nBULLET::::- Selkolla\nBULLET::::- Spriggan\nBULLET::::- Wiedergänger\n\n\nBULLET::::- \"Norwegian Folk Narrative in America\" \"Norwegian-American Studies\"\n"}
{"id": "8376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8376", "title": "Day", "text": "Day\n\nA day is approximately the period of time during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis. A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.\n\nIn 1960, the second was redefined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, and was designated the SI base unit of time. The unit of measurement \"day\", was redefined as 86,400 SI seconds and symbolized \"d\". In 1967, the second and so the day were redefined by atomic electron transition. A civil day is usually 86,400 seconds, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time.\n\nDay can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis. However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next. However, in order to be clear when using 'day' in that sense, \"daytime\" should be used to distinguish it from \"day\" referring to a 24-hour period; this is since daytime usually means 'the time of the day between sunrise and sunset. The word \"day\" may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, \"On which day?\" The life patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species are related to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.\nSeveral definitions of this universal human concept are used according to context, need and convenience. Besides the day of 24 hours (86, 400 seconds), the word \"day\" is used for several different spans of time based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis. An important one is the solar day, defined as the time it takes for the Sun to return to its culmination point (its highest point in the sky). Because celestial orbits are not perfectly circular, and thus objects travel at different speeds at various positions in their orbit, a solar day is not the same length of time throughout the orbital year. Because the Earth orbits the Sun elliptically as the Earth spins on an inclined axis, this period can be up to 7.9 seconds more than (or less than) 24 hours. In recent decades, the average length of a solar day on Earth has been about 86, 400.002 seconds \n(24.000 000 6 hours) and there are currently about 365.242199 solar days in one mean tropical year.\n\nAncient custom has a new day start at either the rising or setting of the Sun on the local horizon (Italian reckoning, for example, being 24 hours from sunset, oldstyle). The exact moment of, and the interval between, two sunrises or sunsets depends on the geographical position (longitude as well as latitude), and the time of year (as indicated by ancient hemispherical sundials).\n\nA more constant day can be defined by the Sun passing through the local meridian, which happens at local noon (upper culmination) or midnight (lower culmination). The exact moment is dependent on the geographical longitude, and to a lesser extent on the time of the year. The length of such a day is nearly constant (24 hours ± 30 seconds). This is the time as indicated by modern sundials.\n\nA further improvement defines a fictitious mean Sun that moves with constant speed along the celestial equator; the speed is the same as the average speed of the real Sun, but this removes the variation over a year as the Earth moves along its orbit around the Sun (due to both its velocity and its axial tilt).\n\nA \"day\", understood as the span of time it takes for the Earth to make one entire rotation with respect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed), is called a \"stellar day\". This period of rotation is about 4 minutes less than 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds) and there are about 366.2422 stellar days in one mean tropical year (one stellar day more than the number of solar days). Other planets and moons have stellar and solar days of different lengths from Earth's.\n\nA day, in the sense of daytime that is distinguished from night time, is commonly defined as the period during which sunlight directly reaches the ground, assuming that there are no local obstacles. The length of daytime averages slightly more than half of the 24-hour day. Two effects make daytime on average longer than nights. The Sun is not a point, but has an apparent size of about 32 minutes of arc. Additionally, the atmosphere refracts sunlight in such a way that some of it reaches the ground even when the Sun is below the horizon by about 34 minutes of arc. So the first light reaches the ground when the centre of the Sun is still below the horizon by about 50 minutes of arc. Thus, daytime is on average around 7 minutes longer than 12 hours.\n\nThe term comes from the Old English \"dæg\", with its cognates such as \"dagur\" in Icelandic, \"Tag\" in German, and \"dag\" in Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and Dutch. All of them from the Indo-European root dyau which explains the similarity with Latin dies though the word is known to come from the Germanic branch. , \"day\" is the 205th most common word in US English, and the 210th most common in UK English.\n\nA day, symbol \"d\", defined as 86, 400 seconds, is not an SI unit, but is accepted for use with SI. The Second is the base unit of time in SI units.\n\nIn 1967–68, during the 13th CGPM (Resolution 1), the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) redefined a second as ... the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.\nThis makes the SI-based day last exactly 794, 243, 384, 928, 000 of those periods.\n\nMainly due to tidal effects, the Earth's rotational period is not constant, resulting in minor variations for both solar days and stellar \"days\". The Earth's day has increased in length over time due to tides raised by the Moon which slow Earth's rotation. Because of the way the second is defined, the mean length of a day is now about 86, 400.002 seconds, and is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds per century (an average over the last 2, 700 years). The length of a day circa 620 million years ago has been estimated from rhythmites (alternating layers in sandstone) as having been about 21.9 hours.\n\nIn order to keep the civil day aligned with the apparent movement of the Sun, a day according to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) can include a negative or positive leap second. Therefore, although typically 86, 400 SI seconds in duration, a civil day can be either 86, 401 or 86, 399 SI seconds long on such a day.\n\nLeap seconds are announced in advance by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), which measures the Earth's rotation and determines whether a leap second is necessary.\n\nFor civil purposes, a common clock time is typically defined for an entire region based on the local mean solar time at a central meridian. Such \"time zones\" began to be adopted about the middle of the 19th century when railroads with regularly occurring schedules came into use, with most major countries having adopted them by 1929. As of 2015, throughout the world, 40 such zones are now in use: the central zone, from which all others are defined as offsets, is known as , which uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nThe most common convention starts the civil day at midnight: this is near the time of the lower culmination of the Sun on the central meridian of the time zone. Such a day may be referred to as a calendar day.\n\nA day is commonly divided into 24 hours of 60 minutes, with each minute composed of 60 seconds.\n\nIn the 19th century, an idea circulated to make a decimal fraction ( or ) of an astronomical day the base unit of time. This was an afterglow of the short-lived movement toward a decimalisation of timekeeping and the calendar, which had been given up already due to its difficulty in transitioning from traditional, more familiar units. The most successful alternative is the \"centiday\", equal to 14.4 minutes (864 seconds), being not only a shorter multiple of an hour (0.24 vs 2.4) but also closer to the SI multiple \"kilosecond\" (1, 000 seconds) and equal to the traditional Chinese unit, \"kè\".\n\nThe word refers to various similarly defined ideas, such as:\nBULLET::::- Full day\nBULLET::::- 24 hours (exactly)\nBULLET::::- The full day covering both the dark and light periods, beginning from the start of the dark period or from a point near the middle of the dark period\nBULLET::::- A full dark and light period, sometimes called a \"nychthemeron\" in English, from the Greek for \"night-day\"; or more colloquially the term . In other languages, is also often used. Other languages also have a separate word for a full day.\nBULLET::::- Daytime\nBULLET::::- The period of light when the Sun is above the local horizon (that is, the time period from sunrise to sunset)\nBULLET::::- The time period from 06:00–18:00 (6:00 am – 6:00 pm) or 21:00 (9:00 pm) or another fixed clock period overlapping or offset from other time periods such as \"morning\", \"evening\", or \"night\".\nBULLET::::- The time period from first-light \"dawn\" to last-light \"twilight\".\n\nFor most diurnal animals, the day naturally begins at dawn and ends at sunset. Humans, with their cultural norms and scientific knowledge, have employed several different conceptions of the day's boundaries. Common convention among the ancient Romans, ancient Chinese and in modern times is for the civil day to begin at midnight, i.e. 00:00, and last a full 24 hours until 24:00 (i.e. 00:00 of the next day). \nIn ancient Egypt, the day was reckoned from sunrise to sunrise. The Jewish day begins at either sunset or nightfall (when three second-magnitude stars appear).\n\nMedieval Europe also followed this tradition, known as Florentine reckoning: in this system, a reference like \"two hours into the day\" meant \"two hours after sunset\" and thus times during the evening need to be shifted back one calendar day in modern reckoning. Days such as Christmas Eve, Halloween, and the Eve of Saint Agnes are remnants of the older pattern when holidays began during the prior evening. Prior to 1926, Turkey had two time systems: Turkish (counting the hours from sunset) and French (counting the hours from midnight).\n\nValidity of tickets, passes, etc., for a day or a number of days may end at midnight, or closing time, when that is earlier. However, if a service (e.g., public transport) operates from for example, 6:00 to 1:00 the next day (which may be noted as 25:00), the last hour may well count as being part of the previous day. For services depending on the day (\"closed on Sundays\", \"does not run on Fridays\", and so on) there is a risk of ambiguity. For example, a day ticket on the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Dutch Railways) is valid for 28 hours, from 0:00 to 28:00 (that is, 4:00 the next day); the validity of a pass on Transport for London (TfL) services is until the end of the \"transport day\" – that is to say, until 4:30 am on the day after the \"expires\" date stamped on the pass.\n\nIn places which experience the midnight sun (polar day), daytime may extend beyond one 24-hour period and could even extend to months.\n\nBesides a stellar day on Earth, determined to be 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds, there are related such days for bodies in the Solar System other than the Earth. For example:\n\nBULLET::::- Mercury: 58 days, 15 hours, 30 minutes\nBULLET::::- Venus: 243 days\nBULLET::::- Earth's Moon: 27 days, 7 hours, 12 minutes\nBULLET::::- Mars: 1 day, 37 minutes\nBULLET::::- Ceres: 9 hours, 4 minutes\nBULLET::::- Jupiter: 9 hours, 56 minutes\nBULLET::::- Saturn: 10 hours, 33 minutes, 38 seconds (+1m52s;-1m19s)\nBULLET::::- Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes\nBULLET::::- Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes\nBULLET::::- Pluto: 6 days, 9 hours\n\nBULLET::::- 24-hour clock\nBULLET::::- Daylight\nBULLET::::- Day length fluctuations\nBULLET::::- Determination of the day of the week\nBULLET::::- Holiday\nBULLET::::- ISO 8601\nBULLET::::- Season, for a discussion of daylight and darkness at various latitudes\nBULLET::::- Synodic day\nBULLET::::- Sidereal time\nBULLET::::- World Meteorological day\nBULLET::::- Zmanim\n"}

In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as NoSQL because they use different query languages.\n\nFormally, a \"database\" refers to a set of related data and the way it is organized. Access to this data is usually provided by a \"database management system\" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database (although restrictions may exist that limit access to particular data). The DBMS provides various functions that allow entry, storage and retrieval of large quantities of information and provides ways to manage how that information is organized.\n\nBecause of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it.\n\nOutside the world of professional information technology, the term \"database\" is often used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet or a card index) as size and usage requirements typically necessitate use of a database management system.\n\nExisting DBMSs provide various functions that allow management of a database and its data which can be classified into four main functional groups:\n\nBULLET::::- Data definition – Creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of the data.\nBULLET::::- Update – Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data.\nBULLET::::- Retrieval – Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other applications. The retrieved data may be made available in a form basically the same as it is stored in the database or in a new form obtained by altering or combining existing data from the database.\nBULLET::::- Administration – Registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.\n\nBoth a database and its DBMS conform to the principles of a particular database model. \"Database system\" refers collectively to the database model, database management system, and database.\n\nPhysically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions.\n\nSince DBMSs comprise a significant market, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.\n\nDatabases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the query language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, scalability, resilience, and security.\n\nThe sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational, SQL/relational, and post-relational.\n\nThe two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL model (network model)\n\nThe relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and they remain dominant: IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS. The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.\n\nObject databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object-relational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also the development of hybrid object-relational databases.\n\nThe next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL databases, introducing fast key-value stores and document-oriented databases. A competing \"next generation\" known as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs.\n\nThe introduction of the term \"database\" coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.\n\nAs computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and Charles Bachman, author of one such product, the Integrated Data Store (IDS), founded the \"Database Task Group\" within CODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of COBOL. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the \"CODASYL approach\", and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market.\n\nThe CODASYL approach relied on the \"manual\" navigation of a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods:\nBULLET::::1. Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented by hashing)\nBULLET::::2. Navigating relationships (called sets) from one record to another\nBULLET::::3. Scanning all the records in a sequential order\n\nLater systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a very straightforward query language. However, in the final tally, CODASYL was very complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications.\n\nIBM also had their own DBMS in 1966, known as Information Management System (IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed, and Bachman's 1973 Turing Award presentation was \"The Programmer as Navigator\". IMS is classified by IBM as a hierarchical database. IDMS and Cincom Systems' TOTAL database are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use .\n\nEdgar F. Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in one of their offshoot offices that was primarily involved in the development of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks\".\n\nIn this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a \"table\" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing \"sparse\" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or \"relations\"), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed. Data may be freely inserted, deleted and edited in these tables, with the DBMS doing whatever maintenance needed to present a table view to the application/user.\nThe relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers. The relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship, like a traditional hierarchical model, and many-to-many relationship, like a navigational (network) model. Thus, a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models, as well as its native tabular model, allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models, as the application requires.\n\nFor instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single record, and unused items would simply not be placed in the database. In the relational approach, the data would be \"normalized\" into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided.\n\nLinking the information back together is the key to this system. In the relational model, some bit of information was used as a \"key\", uniquely defining a particular record. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional tables would be found by searching for this key. For instance, if the login name of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key. This simple \"re-linking\" of related data back into a single collection is something that traditional computer languages are not designed for.\n\nJust as the navigational approach would require programs to loop in order to collect records, the relational approach would require loops to collect information about any \"one\" record. Codd's suggestions was a set-oriented language, that would later spawn the ubiquitous SQL. Using a branch of mathematics known as tuple calculus, he demonstrated that such a system could support all the operations of normal databases (inserting, updating etc.) as well as providing a simple system for finding and returning \"sets\" of data in a single operation.\n\nCodd's paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker. They started a project known as INGRES using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to System R in a number of ways, including the use of a \"language\" for data access, known as QUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard.\n\nIBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, PRTV, and a production one, Business System 12, both now discontinued. Honeywell wrote MRDS for Multics, and now there are two new implementations: Alphora Dataphor and Rel. Most other DBMS implementations usually called \"relational\" are actually SQL DBMSs.\n\nIn 1970, the University of Michigan began development of the MICRO Information Management System based on D.L. Childs' Set-Theoretic Data model. MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by the US Department of Labor, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using the Michigan Terminal System. The system remained in production until 1998.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at lower cost. Examples were IBM System/38, the early offering of Teradata, and the Britton Lee, Inc. database machine.\n\nAnother approach to hardware support for database management was ICL's CAFS accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However this idea is still pursued for certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle (Exadata).\n\nIBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd's concepts as \"System R\" in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query language – SQL – had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as \"SQL/DS\", and, later, \"Database 2\" (DB2).\n\nLarry Ellison's Oracle Database (or more simply, Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM's papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it wasn't until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.\n\nStonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary data store, as do many large companies and financial institutions).\n\nIn Sweden, Codd's paper was also read and Mimer SQL was developed from the mid-1970s at Uppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise.\n\nAnother data model, the entity–relationship model, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for database design as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entity–relationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model, and the difference between the two have become irrelevant.\n\nThe 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 and database software like dBASE. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box. C. Wayne Ratliff, the creator of dBASE, stated: \"dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.\" dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe 1990s, along with a rise in object-oriented programming, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be relations to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term \"object-relational impedance mismatch\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object-relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as object-relational mappings (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem.\n\nXML databases are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on XML document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records.\n\nNoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing denormalized data, and are designed to scale horizontally.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency.\n\nNewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.\n\nDatabases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see Enterprise software).\n\nDatabases are used to hold administrative information and more specialized data, such as engineering data or economic models. Examples include computerized library systems, flight reservation systems, computerized parts inventory systems, and many content management systems that store websites as collections of webpages in a database.\n\nOne way to classify databases involves the type of their contents, for example: bibliographic, document-text, statistical, or multimedia objects. Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases.\n\nBULLET::::- An in-memory database is a database that primarily resides in main memory, but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment.\nBULLET::::- An active database includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of database triggers.\nBULLET::::- A cloud database relies on cloud technology. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, \"in the cloud\", while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a web browser and Open APIs.\nBULLET::::- Data warehouses archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use UPCs so that they can be compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and mining data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.\nBULLET::::- A deductive database combines logic programming with a relational database.\nBULLET::::- A distributed database is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers.\nBULLET::::- A document-oriented database is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases.\nBULLET::::- An embedded database system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application's end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance.\nBULLET::::- End-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases. Some of them are much simpler than full-fledged DBMSs, with more elementary DBMS functionality.\nBULLET::::- A federated database system comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a heterogeneous database system), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.\nBULLET::::- Sometimes the term \"multi-database\" is used as a synonym to federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically middleware is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the two-phase commit protocol, to allow distributed (global) transactions across the participating databases.\nBULLET::::- A graph database is a kind of NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and network databases.\nBULLET::::- An array DBMS is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional arrays such as satellite images and climate simulation output.\nBULLET::::- In a hypertext or hypermedia database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be hyperlinked to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users can conveniently jump around the text. The World Wide Web is thus a large distributed hypertext database.\nBULLET::::- A knowledge base (abbreviated KB, kb or Δ) is a special kind of database for knowledge management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. Also a collection of data representing problems with their solutions and related experiences.\n\nBULLET::::- A mobile database can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device.\nBULLET::::- Operational databases store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions. Examples include customer databases that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business's customers, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, enterprise resource planning systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the organization's money, accounting and financial dealings.\nBULLET::::- A parallel database seeks to improve performance through parallelization for tasks such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.\n\nBULLET::::- Probabilistic databases employ fuzzy logic to draw inferences from imprecise data.\nBULLET::::- Real-time databases process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away.\nBULLET::::- A spatial database can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location-based queries, like \"Where is the closest hotel in my area?\".\nBULLET::::- A temporal database has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time.\nBULLET::::- A terminology-oriented database builds upon an object-oriented database, often customized for a specific field.\nBULLET::::- An unstructured data database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging.\n\nConnolly and Begg define Database Management System (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\".\n\nThe DBMS acronym is sometime extended to indicated the underlying database model, with RDBMS for relational, OODBMS or ORDBMS for the object (orientated) model and ORDBMS for Object-Relational. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristic, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.\n\nThe functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously. The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data. Codd proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose DBMS should provide:\nBULLET::::- Data storage, retrieval and update\nBULLET::::- User accessible catalog or data dictionary describing the metadata\nBULLET::::- Support for transactions and concurrency\nBULLET::::- Facilities for recovering the database should it become damaged\nBULLET::::- Support for authorization of access and update of data\nBULLET::::- Access support from remote locations\nBULLET::::- Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain rules\n\nIt is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities. The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the database engine.\n\nOften DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use. The trend is to minimise the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as embedded databases the need to target zero-administration is paramount.\n\nThe large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and can have involved thousands of human years of development effort through their lifetime.\n\nEarly multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via terminals or terminal emulation software. The client–server architecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a multitier architecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a web browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.\n\nA general-purpose DBMS will provide public application programming interfaces (API) and optionally a processor for database languages such as SQL to allow applications to be written to interact with the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customised and linked to a single application. For example, an email system performing many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email.\n\nExternal interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS. This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a web site that happens to use a database to store and search information.\n\nA programmer will code interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a datasource) via an application program interface (API) or via a database language. The particular API or language chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possible indirectly via a pre-processor or a bridging API. Some API's aim to be database independent, ODBC being a commonly known example. Other common API's include JDBC and ADO.NET.\n\nDatabase languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:\n\nBULLET::::- Data control language (DCL) – controls access to data;\nBULLET::::- Data definition language (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;\nBULLET::::- Data manipulation language (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;\nBULLET::::- Data query language (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.\n\nDatabase languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include:\n\nBULLET::::- SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and is supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs.\nBULLET::::- OQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL.\nBULLET::::- XQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and DB2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.\nBULLET::::- SQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.\n\nA database language may also incorporate features like:\nBULLET::::- DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management\nBULLET::::- Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing\nBULLET::::- Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car)\nBULLET::::- Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience\n\nDatabase storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the \"internal\" (physical) \"level\" in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, \"data about the data\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the \"conceptual level\" and \"external level\" from the internal level when needed. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration setting are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look in the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database).\n\nSome DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database.\n\nVarious low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases.\n\nOften storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing \"materialized views\", which consist of frequently needed \"external views\" or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing of them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy.\n\nOccasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to a same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated.\n\nDatabase security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program).\n\nDatabase access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) is allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces.\n\nThis may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases.\n\nData security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see physical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see data encryption).\n\nChange and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this to the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches.\n\nDatabase transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands).\n\nThe acronym ACID describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.\n\nA database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help importing databases from other popular DBMSs.\n\nAfter designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.).\n\nWhen the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation.\n\nAfter the database is created, initialised and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc.\n\nSometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state.\n\nStatic analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *Abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques. The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database system has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine grained access control, watermarking, etc.\n\nOther DBMS features might include:\nBULLET::::- Database logs – This helps in keeping a history of the executed functions.\nBULLET::::- Graphics component for producing graphs and charts, especially in a data warehouse system.\nBULLET::::- Query optimizer – Performs query optimization on every query to choose an efficient \"query plan\" (a partial order (tree) of operations) to be executed to compute the query result. May be specific to a particular storage engine.\nBULLET::::- Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program maintenance, database performance analysis and monitoring, database configuration monitoring, DBMS hardware configuration (a DBMS and related database may span computers, networks, and storage units) and related database mapping (especially for a distributed DBMS), storage allocation and database layout monitoring, storage migration, etc.\n\nIncreasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as \"DevOps for database\".\n\nThe first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity-relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes.\n\nProducing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from business processes, or the analysis of workflow in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data.\n\nHaving produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms \"data model\" and \"database model\" are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use \"data model\" for the design of a specific database, and \"database model\" for the modeling notation used to express that design).\n\nThe most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency.\n\nThe final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called \"physical database design\", and the output is the physical data model. A key goal during this stage is data independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS.\n\nAnother aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself.\n\nA database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.\n\nCommon logical data models for databases include:\nBULLET::::- Navigational databases\nBULLET::::- Hierarchical database model\nBULLET::::- Network model\nBULLET::::- Graph database\nBULLET::::- Relational model\nBULLET::::- Entity–relationship model\nBULLET::::- Enhanced entity–relationship model\nBULLET::::- Object model\nBULLET::::- Document model\nBULLET::::- Entity–attribute–value model\nBULLET::::- Star schema\n\nAn object-relational database combines the two related structures.\n\nPhysical data models include:\nBULLET::::- Inverted index\nBULLET::::- Flat file\n\nOther models include:\nBULLET::::- Associative model\nBULLET::::- Multidimensional model\nBULLET::::- Array model\nBULLET::::- Multivalue model\n\nSpecialized models are optimized for particular types of data:\nBULLET::::- XML database\nBULLET::::- Semantic model\nBULLET::::- Content store\nBULLET::::- Event store\nBULLET::::- Time series model\n\nA database management system provides three views of the database data:\n\nBULLET::::- The external level defines how each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database. A single database can have any number of views at the external level.\nBULLET::::- The conceptual level unifies the various external views into a compatible global view. It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators.\nBULLET::::- The internal level (or \"physical level\") is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as indexes to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.\n\nWhile there is typically only one conceptual (or logical) and physical (or internal) view of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are the interest of the human resources department. Thus different departments need different \"views\" of the company's database.\n\nThe three-level database architecture relates to the concept of \"data independence\" which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance.\n\nThe conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types.\n\nSeparating the \"external\", \"conceptual\" and \"internal\" levels was a major feature of the relational database model implementations that dominate 21st century databases.\n\nDatabase technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research). Research activity includes theory and development of prototypes. Notable research topics have included models, the atomic transaction concept, and related concurrency control techniques, query languages and query optimization methods, RAID, and more.\n\nThe database research area has several dedicated academic journals (for example, \"ACM Transactions on Database Systems\"-TODS, \"Data and Knowledge Engineering\"-DKE) and annual conferences (e.g., ACM SIGMOD, ACM PODS, VLDB, IEEE ICDE).\n\nBULLET::::- Comparison of database tools\nBULLET::::- Comparison of object database management systems\nBULLET::::- Comparison of object-relational database management systems\nBULLET::::- Comparison of relational database management systems\nBULLET::::- Data hierarchy\nBULLET::::- Data bank\nBULLET::::- Data store\nBULLET::::- Database theory\nBULLET::::- Database testing\nBULLET::::- Database-centric architecture\nBULLET::::- Journal of Database Management\nBULLET::::- Question-focused dataset\n\nBULLET::::- Ling Liu and Tamer M.

{"id": "8378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8378", "title": "Dipole", "text": "Dipole\n\nIn electromagnetism, there are two kinds of dipoles:\nBULLET::::- An electric dipole deals with the separation of the positive and negative charges found in any electromagnetic system. A simple example of this system is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign separated by some typically small distance. (A permanent electric dipole is called an electret.)\nBULLET::::- A magnetic dipole is the closed circulation of an electric current system. A simple example is a single loop of wire with constant current through it. A bar magnet is an example of a magnet with a permanent magnetic dipole moment.\n\nWhether electric or magnetic, dipoles can be characterized by their dipole moment, a vector quantity. For the simple electric dipole, the electric dipole moment points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges. (To be precise: for the definition of the dipole moment, one should always consider the \"dipole limit\", where, for example, the distance of the generating charges should \"converge\" to 0 while simultaneously, the charge strength should \"diverge\" to infinity in such a way that the product remains a positive constant.)\n\nFor the magnetic (dipole) current loop, the magnetic dipole moment points through the loop (according to the right hand grip rule), with a magnitude equal to the current in the loop times the area of the loop.\n\nSimilar to magnetic current loops, the electron particle and some other fundamental particles have magnetic dipole moments, as an electron generates a magnetic field identical to that generated by a very small current loop. However, an electron's magnetic dipole moment is not due to a current loop, but to an intrinsic property of the electron. The electron may also have an \"electric\" dipole moment though such has yet to be observed (see electron electric dipole moment).\nA permanent magnet, such as a bar magnet, owes its magnetism to the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of the electron. The two ends of a bar magnet are referred to as poles—not to be confused with monopoles, see Classification below)—and may be labeled \"north\" and \"south\". In terms of the Earth's magnetic field, they are respectively \"north-seeking\" and \"south-seeking\" poles: if the magnet were freely suspended in the Earth's magnetic field, the north-seeking pole would point towards the north and the south-seeking pole would point towards the south. The dipole moment of the bar magnet points from its magnetic south to its magnetic north pole. In a magnetic compass, the north pole of a bar magnet points north. However, that means that Earth's geomagnetic north pole is the \"south\" pole (south-seeking pole) of its dipole moment and vice versa.\n\nThe only known mechanisms for the creation of magnetic dipoles are by current loops or quantum-mechanical spin since the existence of magnetic monopoles has never been experimentally demonstrated.\n\nThe term comes from the Greek (\"dis\"), \"twice\" and (\"polos\"), \"axis\".\n\nA \"physical dipole\" consists of two equal and opposite point charges: in the literal sense, two poles. Its field at large distances (i.e., distances large in comparison to the separation of the poles) depends almost entirely on the dipole moment as defined above. A \"point (electric) dipole\" is the limit obtained by letting the separation tend to 0 while keeping the dipole moment fixed. The field of a point dipole has a particularly simple form, and the order-1 term in the multipole expansion is precisely the point dipole field.\n\nAlthough there are no known magnetic monopoles in nature, there are magnetic dipoles in the form of the quantum-mechanical spin associated with particles such as electrons (although the accurate description of such effects falls outside of classical electromagnetism). A theoretical magnetic \"point dipole\" has a magnetic field of exactly the same form as the electric field of an electric point dipole. A very small current-carrying loop is approximately a magnetic point dipole; the magnetic dipole moment of such a loop is the product of the current flowing in the loop and the (vector) area of the loop.\n\nAny configuration of charges or currents has a 'dipole moment', which describes the dipole whose field is the best approximation, at large distances, to that of the given configuration. This is simply one term in the multipole expansion when the total charge (\"monopole moment\") is 0—as it \"always\" is for the magnetic case, since there are no magnetic monopoles. The dipole term is the dominant one at large distances: Its field falls off in proportion to , as compared to for the next (quadrupole) term and higher powers of for higher terms, or for the monopole term.\n\nMany molecules have such dipole moments due to non-uniform distributions of positive and negative charges on the various atoms. Such is the case with polar compounds like hydrogen fluoride (HF), where electron density is shared unequally between atoms. Therefore, a molecule's dipole is an electric dipole with an inherent electric field that should not be confused with a magnetic dipole which generates a magnetic field.\n\nThe physical chemist Peter J. W. Debye was the first scientist to study molecular dipoles extensively, and, as a consequence, dipole moments are measured in units named \"debye\" in his honor.\n\nFor molecules there are three types of dipoles:\nBULLET::::- Permanent dipoles: These occur when two atoms in a molecule have substantially different electronegativity: One atom attracts electrons more than another, becoming more negative, while the other atom becomes more positive. A molecule with a permanent dipole moment is called a \"polar\" molecule. See dipole–dipole attractions.\nBULLET::::- Instantaneous dipoles:These occur due to chance when electrons happen to be more concentrated in one place than another in a molecule, creating a temporary dipole. These dipoles are smaller in magnitude than permanent dipoles, but still play a large role in chemistry and biochemistry due to their prevalence. See instantaneous dipole.\nBULLET::::- Induced dipoles: These can occur when one molecule with a permanent dipole repels another molecule's electrons, \"inducing\" a dipole moment in that molecule. A molecule is \"polarized\" when it carries an induced dipole. See induced-dipole attraction.\n\nMore generally, an induced dipole of \"any\" polarizable charge distribution \"ρ\" (remember that a molecule has a charge distribution) is caused by an electric field external to \"ρ\". This field may, for instance, originate from an ion or polar molecule in the vicinity of \"ρ\" or may be macroscopic (e.g., a molecule between the plates of a charged capacitor). The size of the induced dipole moment is equal to the product of the strength of the external field and the dipole polarizability of \"ρ\".\n\nDipole moment values can be obtained from measurement of the dielectric constant. Some typical gas phase values in debye units are:\n\nBULLET::::- carbon dioxide: 0\nBULLET::::- carbon monoxide: 0.112 D\nBULLET::::- ozone: 0.53 D\nBULLET::::- phosgene: 1.17 D\nBULLET::::- water vapor: 1.85 D\nBULLET::::- hydrogen cyanide: 2.98 D\nBULLET::::- cyanamide: 4.27 D\nBULLET::::- potassium bromide: 10.41 D\nPotassium bromide (KBr) has one of the highest dipole moments because it is an ionic compound that exists as a molecule in the gas phase.\nThe overall dipole moment of a molecule may be approximated as a vector sum of bond dipole moments. As a vector sum it depends on the relative orientation of the bonds, so that from the dipole moment information can be deduced about the molecular geometry.\n\nFor example, the zero dipole of CO implies that the two C=O bond dipole moments cancel so that the molecule must be linear. For HO the O−H bond moments do not cancel because the molecule is bent. For ozone (O) which is also a bent molecule, the bond dipole moments are not zero even though the O−O bonds are between similar atoms. This agrees with the Lewis structures for the resonance forms of ozone which show a positive charge on the central oxygen atom. \nAn example in organic chemistry of the role of geometry in determining dipole moment is the \"cis\" and \"trans\" isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene. In the \"cis\" isomer the two polar C−Cl bonds are on the same side of the C=C double bond and the molecular dipole moment is 1.90 D. In the \"trans\" isomer, the dipole moment is zero because the two C−Cl bonds are on opposite sides of the C=C and cancel (and the two bond moments for the much less polar C−H bonds also cancel).\n\nAnother example of the role of molecular geometry is boron trifluoride, which has three polar bonds with a difference in electronegativity greater than the traditionally cited threshold of 1.7 for ionic bonding. However, due to the equilateral triangular distribution of the fluoride ions about the boron cation center, the molecule as a whole does not exhibit any identifiable pole: one cannot construct a plane that divides the molecule into a net negative part and a net positive part.\n\nConsider a collection of \"N\" particles with charges \"q\" and position vectors r. For instance, this collection may be a molecule consisting of electrons, all with charge −\"e\", and nuclei with charge \"eZ\", where \"Z\" is the atomic number of the \"i\" th nucleus.\nThe dipole observable (physical quantity) has the quantum mechanical dipole operator:\n\nNotice that this definition is valid only for neutral atoms or molecules, i.e. total charge equal to zero. In the ionized case, we have\nwhere formula_3 is the center of mass of the molecule/group of particles.\n\nA non-degenerate (\"S\"-state) atom can have only a zero permanent dipole. This fact follows quantum mechanically from the inversion symmetry of atoms. All 3 components of the dipole operator are antisymmetric under inversion with respect to the nucleus,\n\nwhere formula_5 is the dipole operator and formula_6 is the inversion operator.\n\nThe permanent dipole moment of an atom in a non-degenerate state (see degenerate energy level) is given as the expectation (average) value of the dipole operator,\n\nwhere formula_8 is an \"S\"-state, non-degenerate, wavefunction, which is symmetric or antisymmetric under inversion: formula_9. Since the product of the wavefunction (in the ket) and its complex conjugate (in the bra) is always symmetric under inversion and its inverse,\n\nit follows that the expectation value changes sign under inversion. We used here the fact that formula_11, being a symmetry operator, is unitary: formula_12 and by definition the Hermitian adjoint formula_13 may be moved from bra to ket and then becomes formula_14. Since the only quantity that is equal to minus itself is the zero, the expectation value vanishes,\n\nIn the case of open-shell atoms with degenerate energy levels, one could define a dipole moment by the aid of the first-order Stark effect. This gives a non-vanishing dipole (by definition proportional to a non-vanishing first-order Stark shift) only if some of the wavefunctions belonging to the degenerate energies have opposite parity; i.e., have different behavior under inversion. This is a rare occurrence, but happens for the excited H-atom, where 2s and 2p states are \"accidentally\" degenerate (see article Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector for the origin of this degeneracy) and have opposite parity (2s is even and 2p is odd).\n\nThe far-field strength, \"B\", of a dipole magnetic field is given by\n\nwhere\n\nConversion to cylindrical coordinates is achieved using and\n\nwhere \"ρ\" is the perpendicular distance from the \"z\"-axis. Then,\n\nThe field itself is a vector quantity:\n\nwhere\n\nThis is \"exactly\" the field of a point dipole, \"exactly\" the dipole term in the multipole expansion of an arbitrary field, and \"approximately\" the field of any dipole-like configuration at large distances.\n\nThe vector potential A of a magnetic dipole is\n\nwith the same definitions as above.\n\nThe electrostatic potential at position r due to an electric dipole at the origin is given by:\n\nwhere p is the (vector) dipole moment, and \"є\" is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThis term appears as the second term in the multipole expansion of an arbitrary electrostatic potential Φ(r). If the source of Φ(r) is a dipole, as it is assumed here, this term is the only non-vanishing term in the multipole expansion of Φ(r). The electric field from a dipole can be found from the gradient of this potential:\n\nThis is formally identical to the expression for the magnetic field of a point magnetic dipole with only a few names changed. In a real dipole, however, where the charges are physically separate, the \"internal\" field lines are different, since the magnetic field lines are continuous, while those of the electric field diverge or converge from the point charges. For further discussions about the internal field of dipoles, see or Magnetic moment#Internal magnetic field of a dipole. \n\nSince the direction of an electric field is defined as the direction of the force on a positive charge, electric field lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.\n\nWhen placed in an homogeneous electric or magnetic field, equal but opposite forces arise on each side of the dipole creating a torque }:\n\nfor an electric dipole moment p (in coulomb-meters), or\n\nfor a magnetic dipole moment m (in ampere-square meters).\n\nThe resulting torque will tend to align the dipole with the applied field, which in the case of an electric dipole, yields a potential energy of\n\nThe energy of a magnetic dipole is similarly\n\nIn addition to dipoles in electrostatics, it is also common to consider an electric or magnetic dipole that is oscillating in time. It is an extension, or a more physical next-step, to spherical wave radiation.\n\nIn particular, consider a harmonically oscillating electric dipole, with angular frequency \"ω\" and a dipole moment \"p\" along the ẑ direction of the form\n\nIn vacuum, the exact field produced by this oscillating dipole can be derived using the retarded potential formulation as:\n\nFor  ≫ 1, the far-field takes the simpler form of a radiating \"spherical\" wave, but with angular dependence embedded in the cross-product:\n\nThe time-averaged Poynting vector\n\nis not distributed isotropically, but concentrated around the directions lying perpendicular to the dipole moment, as a result of the non-spherical electric and magnetic waves. In fact, the spherical harmonic function (sin \"θ\") responsible for such toroidal angular distribution is precisely the \"l\" = 1 \"p\" wave.\n\nThe total time-average power radiated by the field can then be derived from the Poynting vector as\n\nNotice that the dependence of the power on the fourth power of the frequency of the radiation is in accordance with the Rayleigh scattering, and the underlying effects why the sky consists of mainly blue colour.\n\nA circular polarized dipole is described as a superposition of two linear dipoles.\n\nBULLET::::- Polarization density\nBULLET::::- Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field\nBULLET::::- Electret\nBULLET::::- Indian Ocean Dipole and Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole, two oceanographic phenomena\nBULLET::::- Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction\nBULLET::::- Spin magnetic moment\nBULLET::::- Monopole\nBULLET::::- Solid harmonics\nBULLET::::- Axial multipole moments\nBULLET::::- Cylindrical multipole moments\nBULLET::::- Spherical multipole moments\nBULLET::::- Laplace expansion\nBULLET::::- Molecular solid\nBULLET::::- Magnetic moment#Internal magnetic field of a dipole\n\nBULLET::::- USGS Geomagnetism Program\nBULLET::::- Fields of Force: a chapter from an online textbook\nBULLET::::- Electric Dipole Potential by Stephen Wolfram and Energy Density of a Magnetic Dipole by Franz Krafft.

Draught beer served from a pressurised keg is also known as \n\nUntil Joseph Bramah patented the beer engine in 1785, beer was served directly from the barrel and carried to the customer. The Old English \"\" (\"carry; pull\") developed into a series of related words including \"drag\", \"draw\", and \"draught\". By the time Bramah's beer pumps became popular, the use of the term \"draught\" to refer to the acts of serving or drinking beer was well established and transferred easily to beer served via the hand pumps. In time, the word came to be restricted to only such beer. The usual spelling is now \"draught\" in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand and more commonly \"draft\" in North America, although it can be spelt either way. Regardless of spelling, the word is pronounced or depending on the region the speaker is from.\n\nCanned draught is beer served from a pressurised container featuring a widget. Smooth flow (also known as cream flow, nitrokeg, or smooth) is the name brewers give to draught beers pressurised with a partial nitrogen gas blend.\n\nIn 1691, an article in the \"London Gazette\" mentioned John Lofting, who held a patent for a fire engine: \"The said patentee has also projected a very useful engine for starting of beer, and other liquors which will draw from 20 to 30 barrels an hour, which are completely fixed with brass joints and screws at reasonable rates\".\n\nIn the early 20th century, draught beer started to be served from pressurised containers. Artificial carbonation was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1936, with Watney’s experimental pasteurised beer Red Barrel. Though this method of serving beer did not take hold in the UK until the late 1950s, it did become the favored method in the rest of Europe, where it is known by such terms as \"en pression\". The carbonation method of serving beer subsequently spread to the rest of the world; by the early 1970s the term \"draught beer\" almost exclusively referred to beer served under pressure as opposed to the traditional cask or barrel beer.\n\nIn Britain, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) was founded in 1971 to protect traditional—unpressurised—beer and brewing methods. The group devised the term \"real ale\" to differentiate between beer served from the cask and beer served under pressure. The term \"real ale\" has since been expanded to include bottle-conditioned beer.\n\nKeg beer is often filtered and/or pasteurised, both of which are processes that render the yeast inactive.\n\nIn brewing parlance, a keg is different from a cask. A cask has a tap hole near the edge of the top, and a spile hole on the side used for conditioning the unfiltered and unpasteurised beer. A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after fermentation with carbon dioxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas.\n\n\"Keg\" has become a term of contempt used by some, particularly in the UK, since the 1960s when pasteurised draught beers started replacing traditional cask beers.\n\nKeg beer was replacing traditional cask ale in all parts of the UK, primarily because it requires less care to handle. Since 1971, CAMRA has conducted a consumer campaign on behalf of those who prefer traditional cask beer. CAMRA has lobbied the British Parliament to ensure support for cask ale and microbreweries have sprung up to serve those consumers who prefer traditional cask beer.\n\nPressurised CO in the keg's headspace maintains carbonation in the beer. The CO pressure varies depending on the amount of CO already in the beer and the keg storage temperature. Occasionally the CO gas is blended with nitrogen gas. CO / nitrogen blends are used to allow a higher operating pressure in complex dispensing systems.\n\nNitrogen is used under high pressure when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO to (artificially) form a rich tight head and a less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a foamy appearance. Premixed bottled gas for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO. This premixed gas which only works well with creamy beers is often referred to as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal (an Air Liquide brand name). Using \"Beer Gas\" with other beer styles can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat and lifeless. In the UK, the term \"keg beer\" would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurized.\n\nCask beer should be stored and served at a cellar temperature of . Once a cask is opened, it should be consumed within three days. Keg beer is given additional cooling just prior to being served either by flash coolers or a remote cooler in the cellar. This chills the beer down to temperatures between .\n\nThe words \"draft\" and \"draught\" have been used as marketing terms to describe canned or bottled beers, implying that they taste and appear like beers from a cask or keg. Commercial brewers use this as a marketing tool although it is incorrect to call any beer not drawn from a cask or keg \"draught\". Two examples are Miller Genuine Draft, a pale lager which is produced using a cold filtering system, and Guinness stout in patented \"Draught-flow\" cans and bottles. Guinness is an example of beers that use a nitrogen widget to create a smooth beer with a very dense head. Guinness has recently replaced the widget system from their bottled \"draught\" beer with a coating of cellulose fibres on the inside of the bottle. Statements indicate a new development in bottling technology that enables the mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide to be present in the beer without using a widget, making it according to Guinness \"more drinkable\" from the bottle.\n\nIn some countries, such as Japan, the term \"draft\" applied to canned or bottled beer indicates that the beer is not pasteurized (though it may be filtered), giving it a fresher taste but shorter shelf life than conventional packaged beers.\n\nBULLET::::- Cask ale\nBULLET::::- Beer tap\nBULLET::::- Growler (jug)\n\nBULLET::::- Draught Beer Information: Lots of information regarding draught beer storage and equipment.\nBULLET::::- Irish Specification: PDF version of The Irish Draught Beer Specification\nBULLET::::- Serving a draught beer - Information about how to use properly a draught beer dispensing device\n"}

{"id": "8389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8389", "title": "Major depressive disorder", "text": "Major depressive disorder\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at least two weeks of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal, while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal life, work life, or education, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–8% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and about 50% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.\nThe cause is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance abuse. About 40% of the risk appears to be related to genetics. The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the person's reported experiences and a mental status examination. There is no laboratory test for major depression. Testing, however, may be done to rule out physical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Major depression is more severe and lasts longer than sadness, which is a normal part of life. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for depression among those over the age 12, while a prior Cochrane review found that the routine use of screening questionnaires has little effect on detection or treatment.\nTypically, people are treated with counseling and antidepressant medication. Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed. It is unclear whether medications affect the risk of suicide. Types of counseling used include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy. If other measures are not effective, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered. Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with a risk of harm to self and may occasionally occur against a person's wishes.\nMajor depressive disorder affected approximately 216 million people (3% of the world's population) in 2015. The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France. Lifetime rates are higher in the developed world (15%) compared to the developing world (11%). It causes the second-most years lived with disability, after lower back pain. The most common time of onset is in a person's 20s and 30s. Females are affected about twice as often as males. The American Psychiatric Association added \"major depressive disorder\" to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-III) in 1980. It was a split of the previous depressive neurosis in the DSM-II, which also encompassed the conditions now known as dysthymia and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Those currently or previously affected may be stigmatized.\n\nMajor depression significantly affects a person's family and personal relationships, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. Its impact on functioning and well-being has been compared to that of other chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes.\n\nA person having a major depressive episode usually exhibits a very low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an inability to experience pleasure in activities that were formerly enjoyed. Depressed people may be preoccupied with, or ruminate over, thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt or regret, helplessness, hopelessness, and self-hatred. In severe cases, depressed people may have symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms include delusions or, less commonly, hallucinations, usually unpleasant. Other symptoms of depression include poor concentration and memory (especially in those with melancholic or psychotic features), withdrawal from social situations and activities, reduced sex drive, irritability, and thoughts of death or suicide. Insomnia is common among the depressed. In the typical pattern, a person wakes very early and cannot get back to sleep. Hypersomnia, or oversleeping, can also happen. Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect.\n\nA depressed person may report multiple physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or digestive problems; physical complaints are the most common presenting problem in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization's criteria for depression. Appetite often decreases, with resulting weight loss, although increased appetite and weight gain occasionally occur. Family and friends may notice that the person's behavior is either agitated or lethargic. Older depressed people may have cognitive symptoms of recent onset, such as forgetfulness, and a more noticeable slowing of movements. Depression often coexists with physical disorders common among the elderly, such as stroke, other cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nDepressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed one, and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation. Most lose interest in school and show a decline in academic performance. They may be described as clingy, demanding, dependent, or insecure. Diagnosis may be delayed or missed when symptoms are interpreted as \"normal moodiness.\"\n\nMajor depression frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 \"National Comorbidity Survey\" (US) reports that half of those with major depression also have lifetime anxiety and its associated disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptoms can have a major impact on the course of a depressive illness, with delayed recovery, increased risk of relapse, greater disability and increased suicide attempts. There are increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse and particularly dependence, and around a third of individuals diagnosed with ADHD develop comorbid depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression often co-occur. Depression may also coexist with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), complicating the diagnosis and treatment of both. Depression is also frequently comorbid with alcohol abuse and personality disorders. Depression can also be exacerbated during particular months (usually winter) for those with seasonal affective disorder. While overuse of digital media has been associated with depressive symptoms, digital media may also be utilised in some situations to improve mood.\n\nDepression and pain often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome can worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.\n\nDepression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating and preventing cardiovascular disorders, which further increases their risk of medical complications. In addition, cardiologists may not recognize underlying depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.\n\nThe cause of major depressive disorder is unknown. The biopsychosocial model proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role in causing depression. The diathesis–stress model specifies that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or diathesis, is activated by stressful life events. The preexisting vulnerability can be either genetic, implying an interaction between nature and nurture, or schematic, resulting from views of the world learned in childhood.\n\nChildhood abuse, either physical, sexual or psychological, are all risk factors for depression, among other psychiatric issues that co-occur such as anxiety and drug abuse. Childhood trauma also correlates with severity of depression, lack of response to treatment and length of illness. However, some are more susceptible to developing mental illness such as depression after trauma, and various genes have been suggested to control susceptibility.\n\nFamily and twin studies find that nearly 40% of individual differences in risk for major depressive disorder can be explained by genetic factors. Like most psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder is likely to be influenced by many individual genetic changes. In 2018, a genome-wide association study discovered 44 variants in the genome linked to risk for major depression. This was followed by a 2019 study that found 102 variants in the genome linked to depression. These results have enabled scientists to calculate polygenic risk scores, which combine the estimated effects across the genome into a single score in order to estimate a person's genetic liability for depression. Although these scores explain a small proportion (less than 2%) of individual differences in the risk for major depressive disorder.\n\nThe 5-HTTLPR, or serotonin transporter promoter gene's short allele has been associated with increased risk of depression. However, since the 1990s, results have been inconsistent, with three recent reviews finding an effect and two finding none. Other genes that have been linked to a gene-environment interaction include CRHR1, FKBP5 and BDNF, the first two of which are related to the stress reaction of the HPA axis, and the latter of which is involved in neurogenesis. There is no conclusive effects of candidate gene on depression, either alone or in combination with life stress. Research focusing on specific candidate genes has been criticized for its tendency to generate false positive findings. There are also other efforts to examine interactions between life stress and polygenic risk for depression.\n\nDepression may also come secondary to a chronic or terminal medical condition, such as HIV/AIDS or asthma, and may be labeled \"secondary depression.\" It is unknown whether the underlying diseases induce depression through effect on quality of life, of through shared etiologies (such as degeneration of the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease or immune dysregulation in asthma). Depression may also be iatrogenic (the result of healthcare), such as drug-induced depression. Therapies associated with depression include interferons, beta-blockers, isotretinoin, contraceptives, cardiac agents, anticonvulsants, antimigraine drugs, antipsychotics, and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Drug abuse in early age is also associated with increased risk of developing depression later in life. Depression that occurs as a result of pregnancy is called postpartum depression, and is thought to be the result of hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression associated with seasonal changes in sunlight, is thought to be the result of decreased sunlight.\n\nThe pathophysiology of depression is not yet understood, but the current theories center around monoaminergic systems, the circadian rhythm, immunological dysfunction, HPA axis dysfunction and structural or functional abnormalities of emotional circuits.\n\nThe monoamine theory, derived from the efficacy of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, was the dominant theory until recently. The theory postulates that insufficient activity of monoamine neurotransmitters is the primary cause of depression. Evidence for the monoamine theory comes from multiple areas. Firstly, acute depletion of tryptophan, a necessary precursor of serotonin, a monoamine, can cause depression in those in remission or relatives of depressed patients; this suggests that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission is important in depression. Secondly, the correlation between depression risk and polymorphisms in the 5-HTTLPR gene, which codes for serotonin receptors, suggests a link. Third, decreased size of the locus coeruleus, decreased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, increased density of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, and evidence from rat models suggest decreased adrenergic neurotransmission in depression. Furthermore, decreased levels of homovanillic acid, altered response to dextroamphetamine, responses of depressive symptoms to dopamine receptor agonists, decreased dopamine receptor D1 binding in the striatum, and polymorphism of dopamine receptor genes implicate dopamine, another monoamine, in depression. Lastly, increased activity of monoamine oxidase, which degrades monoamines, has been associated with depression. However, this theory is inconsistent with the fact that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, the fact that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway. One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in raphe nuclei by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants. However, disinhibition of the dorsal raphe has been proposed to occur as a result of \"decreased\" serotonergic activity in tryptophan depletion, resulting in a depressed state mediated by increased serotonin. Further countering the monoamine hypothesis is the fact that rats with lesions of the dorsal raphe are not more depressive than controls, the finding of increased jugular 5-HIAA in depressed patients that normalized with SSRI treatment, and the preference for carbohydrates in depressed patients. Already limited, the monoamine hypothesis has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.\n\nImmune system abnormalities have been observed, including increased levels of cytokines involved in generating sickness behavior (which shares overlap with depression). The effectiveness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors in treating depression, and normalization of cytokine levels after successful treatment further suggest immune system abnormalities in depression.\n\nHPA axis abnormalities have been suggested in depression given the association of CRHR1 with depression and the increased frequency of dexamethasone test non-suppression in depressed patients. However, this abnormality is not adequate as a diagnosis tool, because its sensitivity is only 44%. These stress-related abnormalities have been hypothesized to be the cause of hippocampal volume reductions seen in depressed patients. Furthermore, a meta-analysis yielded decreased dexamethasone suppression, and increased response to psychological stressors. Further abnormal results have been obscured with the cortisol awakening response, with increased response being associated with depression.\n\nTheories unifying neuroimaging findings have been proposed. The first model proposed is the \"Limbic Cortical Model\", which involves hyperactivity of the ventral paralimbic regions and hypoactivity of frontal regulatory regions in emotional processing. Another model, the \"Corito-Striatal model\", suggests that abnormalities of the prefrontal cortex in regulating striatal and subcortical structures results in depression. Another model proposes hyperactivity of salience structures in identifying negative stimuli, and hypoactivity of cortical regulatory structures resulting in a negative emotional bias and depression, consistent with emotional bias studies.\n\nA diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained general practitioner, or by a psychiatrist or psychologist, who records the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The broad clinical aim is to formulate the relevant biological, psychological, and social factors that may be impacting on the individual's mood. The assessor may also discuss the person's current ways of regulating mood (healthy or otherwise) such as alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a mental state examination, which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or pessimism, self-harm or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans. Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to primary-care clinicians. This issue is even more marked in developing countries. The mental health examination may include the use of a rating scale such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Beck Depression Inventory or the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised. The score on a rating scale alone is insufficient to diagnose depression to the satisfaction of the DSM or ICD, but it provides an indication of the severity of symptoms for a time period, so a person who scores above a given cut-off point can be more thoroughly evaluated for a depressive disorder diagnosis. Several rating scales are used for this purpose.\n\nPrimary-care physicians and other non-psychiatrist physicians have more difficulty with underrecognition and undertreatment of depression compared to psychiatric physicians, in part because of the physical symptoms that often accompany depression, in addition to many potential patient, provider, and system barriers. A review found that non-psychiatrist physicians miss about two-thirds of cases, though this has improved somewhat in more recent studies.\n\nBefore diagnosing a major depressive disorder, in general a doctor performs a medical examination and selected investigations to rule out other causes of symptoms. These include blood tests measuring TSH and thyroxine to exclude hypothyroidism; basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance; and a full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease. Adverse affective reactions to medications or alcohol misuse are often ruled out, as well. Testosterone levels may be evaluated to diagnose hypogonadism, a cause of depression in men. Vitamin D levels might be evaluated, as low levels of vitamin D have been associated with greater risk for depression.\n\nSubjective cognitive complaints appear in older depressed people, but they can also be indicative of the onset of a dementing disorder, such as Alzheimer's disease. Cognitive testing and brain imaging can help distinguish depression from dementia. A CT scan can exclude brain pathology in those with psychotic, rapid-onset or otherwise unusual symptoms. In general, investigations are not repeated for a subsequent episode unless there is a medical indication.\n\nNo biological tests confirm major depression. Biomarkers of depression have been sought to provide an objective method of diagnosis. There are several potential biomarkers, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and various functional MRI (fMRI) techniques. One study developed a decision tree model of interpreting a series of fMRI scans taken during various activities. In their subjects, the authors of that study were able to achieve a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 87%, corresponding to a negative predictive value of 98% and a positive predictive value of 32% (positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.15, 0.23, respectively). However, much more research is needed before these tests can be used clinically.\n\nThe most widely used criteria for diagnosing depressive conditions are found in the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" and the World Health Organization's \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\" which uses the name \"depressive episode\" for a single episode and \"recurrent depressive disorder\" for repeated episodes. The latter system is typically used in European countries, while the former is used in the US and many other non-European nations, and the authors of both have worked towards conforming one with the other.\n\nBoth DSM-5 and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms. ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine the depressive disorder diagnosis. According to DSM-5, there are two main depressive symptoms- a depressed mood and loss of interest/pleasure in activities (anhedonia). These symptoms, as well as five out of the nine more specific symptoms listed, must frequently occur for more than two weeks (to the extent in which it impairs functioning) for the diagnosis.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in DSM-5. The diagnosis hinges on the presence of single or recurrent major depressive episodes. Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category Unspecified Depressive Disorder is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The ICD-10 system does not use the term \"major depressive disorder\" but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term \"recurrent\" may be added if there have been multiple episodes without mania.\n\nA major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks. Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning). An episode with psychotic features—commonly referred to as \"psychotic depression\"—is automatically rated as severe. If the patient has had an episode of mania or markedly elevated mood, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder is made instead. Depression without mania is sometimes referred to as \"unipolar\" because the mood remains at one emotional state or \"pole\".\n\nDSM-IV-TR excludes cases where the symptoms are a result of bereavement, although it is possible for normal bereavement to evolve into a depressive episode if the mood persists and the characteristic features of a major depressive episode develop. The criteria were criticized because they do not take into account any other aspects of the personal and social context in which depression can occur. In addition, some studies have found little empirical support for the DSM-IV cut-off criteria, indicating they are a diagnostic convention imposed on a continuum of depressive symptoms of varying severity and duration. Bereavement is no longer an exclusion criterion in DSM-5, and it is now up to the clinician to distinguish between normal reactions to a loss and MDD. Excluded are a range of related diagnoses, including dysthymia, which involves a chronic but milder mood disturbance; recurrent brief depression, consisting of briefer depressive episodes; minor depressive disorder, whereby only some symptoms of major depression are present; and adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which denotes low mood resulting from a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor. Three new depressive disorders were added to the DSM-5: disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, classified by significant childhood irritability and tantrums, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), causing periods of anxiety, depression, or irritability in the week or two before a woman's menstruation, and persistent depressive disorder.\n\nThe DSM-5 recognizes six further subtypes of MDD, called \"specifiers\", in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:\nBULLET::::- \"Melancholic depression\" is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of grief or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, psychomotor retardation, excessive weight loss (not to be confused with anorexia nervosa), or excessive guilt.\nBULLET::::- \"Atypical depression\" is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant weight gain or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness (hypersomnia), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection.\nBULLET::::- \"Catatonic depression\" is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here, the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in schizophrenia or in manic episodes, or may be caused by neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\nBULLET::::- \"Depression with anxious distress\" was added into the DSM-V as a means to emphasize the common co-occurrence between depression or mania and anxiety, as well as the risk of suicide of depressed individuals with anxiety. Specifying in such a way can also help with the prognosis of those diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar disorder.\nBULLET::::- \"Depression with peri-partum onset\" refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth or while a woman is pregnant. DSM-IV-TR used the classification \"postpartum depression,\" but this was changed in order to not exclude cases of depressed woman during pregnancy. Depression with peripartum onset has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-V mandates that, in order to qualify as depression with peripartum onset, onset occur during pregnancy or within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.\nBULLET::::- \"Seasonal affective disorder\" (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.\n\nIn 2016, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening in the adult populations with evidence that it increases the detection of people with depression and with proper treatment improves outcomes. They recommend screening in those between the age of 12 to 18 as well.\n\nA Cochrane review from 2005 found screening programs do not significantly improve detection rates, treatment, or outcome.\n\nTo confirm major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other potential diagnoses must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. Dysthymia is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as \"double depression\"). Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar disorder, also known as \"manic–depressive disorder\", is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or hypomania. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum. Further differential diagnoses involve chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nOther disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, medications, and substance abuse. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination. When the depression is caused by a medication, drug of abuse, or exposure to a toxin, it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called \"substance-induced mood disorder\" in the DSM-IV-TR).\n\nPreventive efforts may result in decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%. Eating large amounts of fish may also reduce the risk.\n\nBehavioral interventions, such as interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are effective at preventing new onset depression. Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the Internet.\n\nHowever, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behavior-oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported attrition rates, and had a well-defined intervention.\n\nThe Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the \"Coping with Depression\" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.\n\nThe three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:\n\nThe guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy. Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned. There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.\n\nTreatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition. A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of psychological versus medical therapy in children.\n\nPhysical exercise is recommended for management of mild depression, and has a moderate effect on symptoms. Exercise has also been found to be effective for (unipolar) major depression. It is equivalent to the use of medications or psychological therapies in most people. In older people it does appear to decrease depression. Exercise may be recommended to people who are willing, motivated, and physically healthy enough to participate in an exercise program as treatment.\n\nThere is a small amount of evidence that skipping a night's sleep may improve depressive symptoms, with the effects usually showing up within a day. This effect is usually temporary. Besides sleepiness, this method can cause a side effect of mania or hypomania.\n\nIn observational studies, smoking cessation has benefits in depression as large as or larger than those of medications.\n\nBesides exercise, sleep and diet may play a role in depression, and interventions in these areas may be an effective add-on to conventional methods.\n\nTalking therapy (psychotherapy) can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals. A 2017 review found that cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be similar to antidepressant medication in terms of effect. A 2012 review found psychotherapy to be better than no treatment but not other treatments. With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used. A 2014 Cochrane review found that work-directed interventions combined with clinical interventions helped to reduce sick days taken by people with depression. There is moderate-quality evidence that psychological therapies are a useful addition to standard antidepressant treatment of treatment-resistant depression in the short term.\n\nPsychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people. Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been stopped or replaced by occasional booster sessions.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) currently has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression. In people under 18, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to reduce the number of sick days taken by people with depression, when used in conjunction with primary care.\n\nThe most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors. Research beginning in the mid-1990s suggested that CBT could perform as well as or better than antidepressants in patients with moderate to severe depression. CBT may be effective in depressed adolescents, although its effects on severe episodes are not definitively known. Several variables predict success for cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents: higher levels of rational thoughts, less hopelessness, fewer negative thoughts, and fewer cognitive distortions. CBT is particularly beneficial in preventing relapse.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.\n\nSeveral variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being rational emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Mindfulness-based stress reduction programs may reduce depression symptoms. Mindfulness programs also appear to be a promising intervention in youth.\n\nPsychoanalysis is a school of thought, founded by Sigmund Freud, which emphasizes the resolution of unconscious mental conflicts. Psychoanalytic techniques are used by some practitioners to treat clients presenting with major depression. A more widely practiced therapy, called psychodynamic psychotherapy, is in the tradition of psychoanalysis but less intensive, meeting once or twice a week. It also tends to focus more on the person's immediate problems, and has an additional social and interpersonal focus. In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.\n\nConflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic (dysthymia) or severe.\n\nWhile small benefits were found, researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore state they may be due to issues with the trials rather than a true effect of the medication. In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance. Similar results were obtained in a meta-analysis by Fornier.\n\nA review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline, have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.\n\nIn 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012. The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.\n\nTo find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried. Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50–75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement. Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 16 to 20 weeks after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence, and even up to one year of continuation is recommended. People with chronic depression may need to take medication indefinitely to avoid relapse.\n\nSSRIs are the primary medications prescribed, owing to their relatively mild side-effects, and because they are less toxic in overdose than other antidepressants. People who do not respond to one SSRI can be switched to another antidepressant, and this results in improvement in almost 50% of cases. Another option is to switch to the atypical antidepressant bupropion. Venlafaxine, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, may be modestly more effective than SSRIs. However, venlafaxine is not recommended in the UK as a first-line treatment because of evidence suggesting its risks may outweigh benefits, and it is specifically discouraged in children and adolescents.\nFor children, some research has supported the use of the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine. The benefit however appears to be slight in children, while other antidepressants have not been shown to be effective. Medications are not recommended in children with mild disease. There is also insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness in those with depression complicated by dementia. Any antidepressant can cause low blood sodium levels; nevertheless, it has been reported more often with SSRIs. It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating atypical antidepressant mirtazapine can be used in such cases.\n\nIrreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, an older class of antidepressants, have been plagued by potentially life-threatening dietary and drug interactions. They are still used only rarely, although newer and better-tolerated agents of this class have been developed. The safety profile is different with reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as moclobemide, where the risk of serious dietary interactions is negligible and dietary restrictions are less strict.\nFor children, adolescents, and probably young adults between 18 and 24 years old, there is a higher risk of both suicidal ideations and suicidal behavior in those treated with SSRIs. For adults, it is unclear whether SSRIs affect the risk of suicidality. One review found no connection; another an increased risk; and a third no risk in those 25–65 years old and a decreased risk in those more than 65. A black box warning was introduced in the United States in 2007 on SSRIs and other antidepressant medications due to the increased risk of suicide in patients younger than 24 years old. Similar precautionary notice revisions were implemented by the Japanese Ministry of Health.\n\nThere is some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids fish oil supplements containing high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are effective in the treatment of, but not the prevention of major depression. However, a Cochrane review determined there was insufficient high quality evidence to suggest omega-3 fatty acids were effective in depression. There is limited evidence that vitamin D supplementation is of value in alleviating the symptoms of depression in individuals who are vitamin D-deficient. There is some preliminary evidence that COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, have a beneficial effect on major depression. Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression to nearly the same levels as the general population. There is a narrow range of effective and safe dosages of lithium thus close monitoring may be needed. Low-dose thyroid hormone may be added to existing antidepressants to treat persistent depression symptoms in people who have tried multiple courses of medication. Limited evidence suggests stimulants, such as amphetamine and modafinil, may be effective in the short term, or as adjuvant therapy. Also, it is suggested that folate supplements may have a role in depression management. There is tentative evidence for benefit from testosterone in males.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a standard psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses. ECT is used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder.\n\nA round of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is unipolar or bipolar. Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond relapse within twelve months.\n\nAside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia. Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss. ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.\n\nA usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week, until the patient is no longer suffering symptoms. ECT is administered under anesthesia with a muscle relaxant. Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus. These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission. After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some patients receive maintenance ECT.\n\nECT appears to work in the short term via an anticonvulsant effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via neurotrophic effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain. TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (trMDD) in 2008 and as of 2014 evidence supports that it is probably effective. The American Psychiatric Association the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders, and the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have endorsed TMS for trMDD.\n\nBright light therapy reduces depression symptom severity, with benefit for both seasonal affective disorder and for nonseasonal depression, and an effect similar to those for conventional antidepressants. For nonseasonal depression, adding light therapy to the standard antidepressant treatment was not effective. For nonseasonal depression, where light was used mostly in combination with antidepressants or wake therapy, a moderate effect was found, with response better than control treatment in high-quality studies, in studies that applied morning light treatment, and with people who respond to total or partial sleep deprivation. Both analyses noted poor quality, short duration, and small size of most of the reviewed studies. There is insufficient evidence for Reiki and dance movement therapy in depression. As of 2019 cannabis is specifically not recommended as a treatment.\n\nMajor depressive episodes often resolve over time whether or not they are treated. Outpatients on a waiting list show a 10–15% reduction in symptoms within a few months, with approximately 20% no longer meeting the full criteria for a depressive disorder. The median duration of an episode has been estimated to be 23 weeks, with the highest rate of recovery in the first three months.\n\nStudies have shown that 80% of those suffering from their first major depressive episode will suffer from at least one more during their life, with a lifetime average of 4 episodes. Other general population studies indicate that around half those who have an episode recover (whether treated or not) and remain well, while the other half will have at least one more, and around 15% of those experience chronic recurrence. Studies recruiting from selective inpatient sources suggest lower recovery and higher chronicity, while studies of mostly outpatients show that nearly all recover, with a median episode duration of 11 months. Around 90% of those with severe or psychotic depression, most of whom also meet criteria for other mental disorders, experience recurrence.\n\nA high proportion of people who experience full symptomatic remission still have at least one not fully resolved symptom after treatment. Recurrence or chronicity is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment. Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six months after remission to prevent relapse. Evidence from many randomized controlled trials indicate continuing antidepressant medications after recovery can reduce the chance of relapse by 70% (41% on placebo vs. 18% on antidepressant). The preventive effect probably lasts for at least the first 36 months of use.\n\nPeople experiencing repeated episodes of depression require ongoing treatment in order to prevent more severe, long-term depression. In some cases, people must take medications for the rest of their lives.\n\nCases when outcome is poor are associated with inappropriate treatment, severe initial symptoms including psychosis, early age of onset, previous episodes, incomplete recovery after one year of treatment, pre-existing severe mental or medical disorder, and family dysfunction.\n\nDepressed individuals have a shorter life expectancy than those without depression, in part because depressed patients are at risk of dying of suicide. However, they also have a higher rate of dying from other causes, being more susceptible to medical conditions such as heart disease. Up to 60% of people who die of suicide have a mood disorder such as major depression, and the risk is especially high if a person has a marked sense of hopelessness or has both depression and borderline personality disorder. The lifetime risk of suicide associated with a diagnosis of major depression in the US is estimated at 3.4%, which averages two highly disparate figures of almost 7% for men and 1% for women (although suicide attempts are more frequent in women). The estimate is substantially lower than a previously accepted figure of 15%, which had been derived from older studies of hospitalized patients.\n\nDepression is often associated with unemployment and poverty. Major depression is currently the leading cause of disease burden in North America and other high-income countries, and the fourth-leading cause worldwide. In the year 2030, it is predicted to be the second-leading cause of disease burden worldwide after HIV, according to the WHO. Delay or failure in seeking treatment after relapse and the failure of health professionals to provide treatment are two barriers to reducing disability.\n\nMajor depressive disorder affects approximately 216 million people in 2015 (3% of the global population). The percentage of people who are affected at one point in their life varies from 7% in Japan to 21% in France. In most countries the number of people who have depression during their lives falls within an 8–18% range. In North America, the probability of having a major depressive episode within a year-long period is 3–5% for males and 8–10% for females. Major depression is about twice as common in women as in men, although it is unclear why this is so, and whether factors unaccounted for are contributing to this. The relative increase in occurrence is related to pubertal development rather than chronological age, reaches adult ratios between the ages of 15 and 18, and appears associated with psychosocial more than hormonal factors. Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide.\n\nPeople are most likely to develop their first depressive episode between the ages of 30 and 40, and there is a second, smaller peak of incidence between ages 50 and 60. The risk of major depression is increased with neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis, and during the first year after childbirth. It is also more common after cardiovascular illnesses, and is related more to those with a poor cardiac disease outcome than to a better one. Studies conflict on the prevalence of depression in the elderly, but most data suggest there is a reduction in this age group. Depressive disorders are more common in urban populations than in rural ones and the prevalence is increased in groups with poorer socioeconomic factors, e.g., homelessness.\n\nThe Ancient Greek physician Hippocrates described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all \"fears and despondencies, if they last a long time\" as being symptomatic of the ailment. It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.\n\nThe term \"depression\" itself was derived from the Latin verb \"deprimere\", \"to press down\". From the 14th century, \"to depress\" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author Richard Baker's \"Chronicle\" to refer to someone having \"a great depression of spirit\", and by English author Samuel Johnson in a similar sense in 1753. The term also came into use in physiology and economics. An early usage referring to a psychiatric symptom was by French psychiatrist Louis Delasiauve in 1856, and by the 1860s it was appearing in medical dictionaries to refer to a physiological and metaphorical lowering of emotional function. Since Aristotle, melancholia had been associated with men of learning and intellectual brilliance, a hazard of contemplation and creativity. The newer concept abandoned these associations and through the 19th century, became more associated with women.\nAlthough \"melancholia\" remained the dominant diagnostic term, \"depression\" gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as \"depressive states\".\n\nSigmund Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper \"Mourning and Melancholia\". He theorized that objective loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in subjective loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an unconscious, narcissistic process called the \"libidinal cathexis\" of the ego. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively but the ego itself is compromised. The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness. He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor. Adolf Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing \"reactions\" in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term \"depression\" should be used instead of \"melancholia\". The first version of the DSM (DSM-I, 1952) contained \"depressive reaction\" and the DSM-II (1968) \"depressive neurosis\", defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms. The chemical imbalance theory has never been proven.\n\nThe term \"unipolar\" (along with the related term \"bipolar\") was coined by the neurologist and psychiatrist Karl Kleist, and subsequently used by his disciples Edda Neele and Karl Leonhard.\n\nThe term \"Major depressive disorder\" was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the \"Research Diagnostic Criteria\", building on earlier Feighner Criteria), and was incorporated into the DSM-III in 1980. To maintain consistency the ICD-10 used the same criteria, with only minor alterations, but using the DSM diagnostic threshold to mark a \"mild depressive episode\", adding higher threshold categories for moderate and severe episodes. The ancient idea of \"melancholia\" still survives in the notion of a melancholic subtype.\n\nThe new definitions of depression were widely accepted, albeit with some conflicting findings and views. There have been some continued empirically based arguments for a return to the diagnosis of melancholia. There has been some criticism of the expansion of coverage of the diagnosis, related to the development and promotion of antidepressants and the biological model since the late 1950s.\n\nThe term \"depression\" is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or simply to a low mood. People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. \"Because of the lack of scientific certainty,\" one commentator has observed, \"the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it.\" There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.\n\nThe diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as China. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or somatize emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified). Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status. Australian professor Gordon Parker and others have argued that the Western concept of depression \"medicalizes\" sadness or misery. Similarly, Hungarian-American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz and others argue that depression is a metaphorical illness that is inappropriately regarded as an actual disease. There has also been concern that the DSM, as well as the field of descriptive psychiatry that employs it, tends to reify abstract phenomena such as depression, which may in fact be social constructs. American archetypal psychologist James Hillman writes that depression can be healthy for the soul, insofar as \"it brings refuge, limitation, focus, gravity, weight, and humble powerlessness.\" Hillman argues that therapeutic attempts to eliminate depression echo the Christian theme of resurrection, but have the unfortunate effect of demonizing a soulful state of being.\n\nHistorical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to social stigma about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings, or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression. People who may have had depression include English author Mary Shelley, American-British writer Henry James, and American president Abraham Lincoln. Some well-known contemporary people with possible depression include Canadian songwriter Leonard Cohen and American playwright and novelist Tennessee Williams. Some pioneering psychologists, such as Americans William James and John B. Watson, dealt with their own depression.\n\nThere has been a continuing discussion of whether neurological disorders and mood disorders may be linked to creativity, a discussion that goes back to Aristotelian times. British literature gives many examples of reflections on depression. English philosopher John Stuart Mill experienced a several-months-long period of what he called \"a dull state of nerves\", when one is \"unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement; one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times, becomes insipid or indifferent\". He quoted English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Dejection\" as a perfect description of his case: \"A grief without a pang, void, dark and drear, / A drowsy, stifled, unimpassioned grief, / Which finds no natural outlet or relief / In word, or sigh, or tear.\" English writer Samuel Johnson used the term \"the black dog\" in the 1780s to describe his own depression, and it was subsequently popularized by depression sufferer former British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nSocial stigma of major depression is widespread, and contact with mental health services reduces this only slightly. Public opinions on treatment differ markedly to those of health professionals; alternative treatments are held to be more helpful than pharmacological ones, which are viewed poorly. In the UK, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners conducted a joint Five-year Defeat Depression campaign to educate and reduce stigma from 1992 to 1996; a MORI study conducted afterwards showed a small positive change in public attitudes to depression and treatment.\n\nDepression is especially common among those over 65 years of age and increases in frequency beyond this age. In addition, the risk of depression increases in relation to the frailty of the individual. Depression is one of the most important factors which negatively impact quality of life in adults, as well as the elderly. Both symptoms and treatment among the elderly differ from those of the rest of the population.\n\nAs with many other diseases, it is common among the elderly not to present with classical depressive symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases. Treatment differs in that studies of SSRIs have shown lesser and often inadequate effects among the elderly, while other drugs, such as duloxetine (a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), with more clear effects have adverse effects, such as dizziness, dryness of the mouth, diarrhea and constipation, which can be especially difficult to handle among the elderly.\n\nProblem solving therapy was, as of 2015, the only psychological therapy with proven effect, and can be likened to a simpler form of cognitive behavioral therapy. However, elderly with depression are seldom offered any psychological treatment, and the evidence proving other treatments effective is incomplete. ECT has been used in the elderly, and register-studies suggest it is effective, although less so as compared to the rest of the population. The risks involved with treatment of depression among the elderly as opposed to benefits are not entirely clear.\n\nMRI scans of patients with depression have revealed a number of differences in brain structure compared to those who are not depressed. Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies in major depression reported that, compared to controls, depressed patients had increased volume of the lateral ventricles and adrenal gland and smaller volumes of the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, and frontal lobe (including the orbitofrontal cortex and gyrus rectus). Hyperintensities have been associated with patients with a late age of onset, and have led to the development of the theory of vascular depression.\n\nTrials are looking at the effects of botulinum toxins on depression. The idea is that the drug is used to make the person look less frowning and that this stops the negative facial feedback from the face. In 2015 results showed, however, that the partly positive effects that had been observed until then could have been due to placebo effects.\n\nIn 2018-2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough therapy designation to Compass Pathways and, separately, Usona Institute. Compass is a for-profit company studying psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression; Usona is a non-profit organization studying psilocybin for major depressive disorder more broadly. \n\nModels of depression in animals for the purpose of study include iatrogenic depression models (such as drug-induced), forced swim tests, tail suspension test, and learned helplessness models. Criteria frequently used to assess depression in animals include expression of despair, neurovegetative changes, and anhedonia, as many other criteria for depression are untestable in animals, such as guilt and suicidality.\n\n"}
{"id": "8391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8391", "title": "Diana (mythology)", "text": "Diana (mythology)\n\nDiana () is a Roman goddess of the hunt, the Moon, and nature, associated with wild animals and woodland. She is equated with the Greek goddess Artemis, and absorbed much of Artemis' mythology early in Roman history, including a birth on the island of Delos to parents Jupiter and Latona, and a twin brother, Apollo, though she had an independent origin in Italy.\n\nDiana was known as the virgin goddess of childbirth and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, along with Minerva and Vesta, who swore never to marry. Oak groves and deer were especially sacred to her. Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities; Egeria the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and Virbius, the woodland god.\n\nDiana is revered in modern Neopagan religions including Roman Neopaganism, Stregheria, and Wicca. From the medieval to the modern period, as folklore attached to her developed and was eventually adapted into neopagan religions, the mythology surrounding Diana grew to include a consort (Lucifer) and daughter (Aradia), figures sometimes recognized by modern traditions. In the ancient, medieval, and modern periods, Diana has been considered a triple deity, merged with a goddess of the moon (Luna/Selene) and the underworld (usually Hecate).\n\nDīāna is an adjectival form developed from an ancient *\"divios\", corresponding to later \"dīvus\", \"dius\", as in Dius Fidius, Dea Dia, and in the neuter form \"dium\" 'sky'.\nIt is derived from Proto-Indo-European \"*dyew-\" '(bright) sky'; the same word is also the root behind the name of the Vedic sky god Dyaus, as well as the Latin words \"deus\" 'god', \"diēs\" 'day, daylight', and \"diurnus\" 'daily'.\n\nOn the tablets of Pylos a theonym \"di-wi-ja\" is supposed as referring to a deity precursor of Artemis. Modern scholars mostly accept the identification.\n\nThe ancient Latin writers Varro and Cicero considered the etymology of Dīāna as allied to that of \"dies\" and connected to the shine of the Moon.\n\n... people regard Diana and the moon as one and the same. ... the moon \"(luna)\" is so called from the verb to shine \"(lucere)\". Lucina is identified with it, which is why in our country they invoke Juno Lucina in childbirth, just as the Greeks call on Diana the Light-bearer. Diana also has the name \"Omnivaga\" (\"wandering everywhere\"), not because of her hunting but because she is numbered as one of the seven planets; her name Diana derives from the fact that she turns darkness into daylight \"(dies)\". She is invoked at childbirth because children are born occasionally after seven, or usually after nine, lunar revolutions ...\n\nThe persona of Diana is complex, and contains a number of archaic features. Diana was originally considered to be a goddess of the wilderness and of the hunt, a central sport in both Roman and Greek culture. Early Roman inscriptions to Diana celebrated her primarily as a huntress and patron of hunters. Later, in the Hellenistic period, Diana came to be equally or more revered as a goddess not of the wild woodland but of the \"tame\" countryside, or \"villa rustica\", the idealization of which was common in Greek thought and poetry. This dual role as goddess of both civilization and the wild, and therefore the civilized countryside, first applied to the Greek goddess Artemis (for example, in the 3rd century BCE poetry of Anacreon). By the 3rd century CE, after Greek influence had a profound impact on Roman religion, Diana had been almost fully combined with Artemis and took on many of her attributes, both in her spiritual domains and in the description of her appearance. The Roman poet Nemesianus wrote a typical description of Diana: She carried a bow and a quiver full of golden arrows, wore a golden cloak, purple half-boots, and a belt with a jeweled buckle to hold her tunic together, and wore her hair gathered in a ribbon. By the 5th century CE, almost a millennia after her cult's entry into Rome, the philosopher Proclus could still characterize Diana as \"the inspective guardian of every thing rural, [who] represses every thing rustic and uncultivated.\"\n\nDiana was often considered an aspect of a triple goddess, known as \"Diana triformis\": Diana, Luna, and Hecate. According to historian C.M. Green, \"these were neither different goddesses nor an amalgamation of different goddesses. They were Diana...Diana as huntress, Diana as the moon, Diana of the underworld.\" At her sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi, Diana was venerated as a triple goddess beginning in the late 6th century BCE.\n\nAndreas Alföldi interpreted an image on a late Republican coin as the Latin Diana \"conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate\". This coin, minted by P. Accoleius Lariscolus in 43 BCE, has been acknowledged as representing an archaic statue of Diana Nemorensis. It represents Artemis with the bow at one extremity, Luna-Selene with flowers at the other and a central deity not immediately identifiable, all united by a horizontal bar. The iconographical analysis allows the dating of this image to the 6th century at which time there are Etruscan models. The coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the \"lucus\" of Nemi in 43 BCE. Lake Nemi was called \"Triviae lacus\" by Virgil (\"Aeneid\" 7.516), while Horace called Diana \"montium custos nemoremque virgo\" (\"keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi\") and \"diva triformis\" (\"three-form goddess\").\n\nTwo heads found in the sanctuary and the Roman theatre at Nemi, which have a hollow on their back, lend support to this interpretation of an archaic triple Diana.\n\nThe earliest epithet of Diana was \"Trivia\", and she was addressed with that title by Virgil, Catullus, and many others. \"Trivia\" comes from the Latin \"trivium\", \"triple way\", and refers to Diana's guardianship over roadways, particularly Y-junctions or three-way crossroads. This role carried a somewhat dark and dangerous connotation, as it metaphorically pointed the way to the underworld. In the 1st-century CE play \"Medea\", Seneca's titular sorceress calls on Trivia to cast a magic spell. She evokes the triple goddess of Diana, Selene, and Hecate, and specifies that she requires the powers of the latter. The 1st century poet Horace similarly wrote of a magic incantation invoking the power of both Diana and Proserpina. The symbol of the crossroads is relevant to several aspects of Diana's domain. It can symbolize the paths hunters may encounter in the forest, lit only by the full moon; this symbolizes making choices \"in the dark\" without the light of guidance.\n\nDiana's role as a goddess of the underworld, or at least of ushering people between life and death, caused her early on to be conflated with Hecate (and occasionally also with Proserpina). However, her role as an underworld goddess appears to pre-date strong Greek influence (though the early Greek colony of Cumae had a cult of Hekate and certainly had contacts with the Latins). A theater in her sanctuary at Lake Nemi included a pit and tunnel that would have allowed actors to easily descend on one side of the stage and ascend on the other, indicating a connection between the phases of the moon and a descent by the moon goddess into the underworld. It is likely that her underworld aspect in her original Latin worship did not have a distinct name, like Luna was for her moon aspect. This is due to a seeming reluctance or taboo by the early Latins to name underworld deities, and the fact that they believed the underworld to be silent, precluding naming. Hekate, a Greek goddess also associated with the boundary between the earth and the underworld, became attached to Diana as a name for her underworld aspect following Greek influence.\n\nDiana was often considered to be a goddess associated with fertility and childbirth, and the protection of women during labor. This probably arose as an extension of her association with the moon, whose cycles were believed to parallel the menstrual cycle, and which was used to track the months during pregnancy. At her shrine in Aricia, worshipers left votive terracotta offerings for the goddess in the shapes of babies and wombs, and the temple there also offered care of pups and pregnant dogs. This care of infants also extended to the training of both young people and dogs, especially for hunting. In her role as a protector of childbirth, Diana was called \"Diana Lucina\" or even \"Juno Lucina\", because her domain overlapped with that of the goddess Juno. The title of Juno may also have had an independent origin as it applied to Diana, with the literal meaning of \"helper\" - Diana as \"Juno Lucina\" would be the \"helper of childbirth\".\n\nAccording to a theory proposed by Georges Dumézil, Diana falls into a particular subset of celestial gods, referred to in histories of religion as \"frame gods\". Such gods, while keeping the original features of celestial divinities (i.e. transcendent heavenly power and abstention from direct rule in worldly matters), did not share the fate of other celestial gods in Indoeuropean religions - that of becoming \"dei otiosi\", or gods without practical purpose, since they did retain a particular sort of influence over the world and mankind. The celestial character of Diana is reflected in her connection with inaccessibility, virginity, light, and her preference for dwelling on high mountains and in sacred woods. Diana, therefore, reflects the heavenly world in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, however, she is seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth. These functions are apparent in the traditional institutions and cults related to the goddess:\nBULLET::::1. The legend of the rex Nemorensis, Diana's \"sacerdos\" (priest) in the Arician wood, who held the position until someone else challenged and killed him in a duel, after breaking a branch from a certain tree of the wood. This ever open succession reveals the character and mission of the goddess as a guarantor of kingly status through successive generations. Her function as bestower of authority to rule is also attested in the story related by Livy in which a Sabine man who sacrifices a heifer to Diana wins for his country the seat of the Roman empire.\nBULLET::::2. Diana was also worshiped by women who wanted to be pregnant or who, once pregnant, prayed for an easy delivery. This form of worship is attested in archaeological finds of votive statuettes in her sanctuary in the nemus Aricinum as well as in ancient sources, e.g. Ovid.\n\nAccording to Dumezil, the forerunner of all \"frame gods\" is an Indian epic hero who was the image (avatar) of the Vedic god Dyaus. Having renounced the world, in his roles of father and king, he attained the status of an immortal being while retaining the duty of ensuring that his dynasty is preserved and that there is always a new king for each generation. The Scandinavian god Heimdallr performs an analogous function: he is born first and will die last. He too gives origin to kingship and the first king, bestowing on him regal prerogatives.\nDiana, although a female deity, has exactly the same functions, preserving mankind through childbirth and royal succession.\n\nF. H. Pairault, in her essay on Diana, qualified Dumézil's theory as \"\"impossible to verify\"\".\n\nUnlike the Greek gods, Roman gods were originally considered to be numina: divine powers of presence and will that did not necessarily have physical form. At the time Rome was founded, Diana and the other major Roman gods probably did not have much mythology per se, or any depictions in human form. The idea of gods as having anthropomorphic qualities and human-like personalities and actions developed later, under the influence of Greek and Etruscan religion.\n\nBy the 3rd century BCE, Diana is found listed among the twelve major gods of the Roman pantheon by the poet Ennius. Though the Capitoline Triad were the primary state gods of Rome, early Roman myth did not assign a strict hierarchy to the gods the way Greek mythology did, though the Greek hierarchy would eventually be adopted by Roman religion as well.\n\nOnce Greek influence had caused Diana to be considered identical to the Greek goddess Artemis, Diana acquired Artemis' physical description, attributes, and variants of her myths as well. Like Artemis, Diana is usually depicted in art wearing a short skirt, with a hunting bow and quiver, and often accompanied by hunting dogs. A 1st-century BCE Roman coin (see above) depicted her with a unique, short hairstyle, and in triple form, with one form holding a bow and another holding a poppy.\n\nWhen worship of Apollo was first introduced to Rome, Diana became conflated with Apollo's sister Artemis as in the earlier Greek myths, and as such she became identified as the daughter of Apollo's parents Latona and Jupiter. Though Diana was usually considered to be a virgin goddess like Artemis, later authors sometimes attributed consorts and children to her. According to Cicero and Ennius, Trivia (an epithet of Diana) and Caelus were the parents of Janus, as well as of Saturn and Ops.\n\nAccording to Macrobius (who cited Nigidius Figulus and Cicero), Janus and Jana (Diana) are a pair of divinities, worshiped as the sun and moon. Janus was said to receive sacrifices before all the others because, through him, the way of access to the desired deity is made apparent.\n\nDiana's mythology incorporated stories which were variants of earlier stories about Artemis. Possibly the most well-known of these is the myth of Actaeon. In Ovid's version of this myth, part of his poem \"Metamorphoses\", he tells of a pool or grotto hidden in the wooded valley of Gargaphie. There, Diana, the goddess of the woods, would bathe and rest after a hunt. Actaeon, a young hunter, stumbled across the grotto and accidentally witnessed the goddess bathing without invitation. In retaliation, Diana splashed him with water from the pool, cursing him, and he transformed into a deer. His own hunting dogs caught his scent, and tore him apart.\n\nOvid's version of the myth of Actaeon differs from most earlier sources. Unlike earlier myths about Artemis, Actaeon is killed for an innocent mistake, glimpsing Diana bathing. An earlier variant of this myth, known as the Bath of Pallas, had the hunter intentionally spy on the bathing goddess Pallas (Athena), and earlier versions of the myth involving Artemis did not involve the bath at all.\n\nDiana was an ancient goddess common to all Latin tribes. Therefore, many sanctuaries were dedicated to her in the lands inhabited by Latins. Her primary sanctuary was a woodland grove overlooking Lake Nemi, a body of water also known as \"Diana's Mirror\", where she was worshiped as Diana Nemorensis, or \"Diana of the Wood\". In Rome, the cult of Diana may have been almost as old as the city itself. Varro mentions her in the list of deities to whom king Titus Tatius promised to build a shrine. His list included Luna and Diana Lucina as separate entities. Another testimony to the antiquity of her cult is to be found in the \"lex regia\" of King Tullus Hostilius that condemns those guilty of incest to the \"sacratio\" to Diana. She had a temple in Rome on the Aventine Hill, according to tradition dedicated by king Servius Tullius. Its location is remarkable as the Aventine is situated outside the pomerium, i.e. original territory of the city, in order to comply with the tradition that Diana was a goddess common to all Latins and not exclusively of the Romans. Being placed on the Aventine, and thus outside the \"pomerium\", meant that Diana's cult essentially remained a \"foreign\" one, like that of Bacchus; she was never officially \"transferred\" to Rome as Juno was after the sack of Veii.\n\nOther known sanctuaries and temples to Diana include Colle di Corne near Tusculum, where she is referred to with the archaic Latin name of \"deva Cornisca\" and where existed a collegium of worshippers; at Évora, Portugal; Mount Algidus, also near Tusculum; at Lavinium; and at Tibur (Tivoli), where she is referred to as \"Diana Opifera Nemorensis\". Diana was also worshiped at a sacred wood mentioned by Livy - \"ad compitum Anagninum\" (near Anagni), and on Mount Tifata in Campania.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, men and women alike were worshipers of Diana and were welcomed into all of her temples. The one exception seems to have been a temple on the Vicus Patricius, which men either did not enter due to tradition, or were not allowed to enter. Plutarch related a legend that a man had attempted to assault a woman worshiping in this temple and was killed by a pack of dogs (echoing the myth of Diana and Actaeon), which resulted in a superstition against men entering the temple.\n\nA feature common to nearly all of Diana's temples and shrines by the second century AD was the hanging up of stag antlers. Plutarch noted that the only exception to this was the temple on the Aventine Hill, in which bull horns had been hung up instead. Plutarch explains this by way of reference to a legend surrounding the sacrifice of an impressive Sabine bull by King Servius at the founding of the Aventine temple.\n\nDiana's worship may have originated at an open-air sanctuary overlooking Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills near Aricia, where she was worshiped as Diana Nemorensis, or (\"Diana of the Sylvan Glade\"). According to legendary accounts, the sanctuary was founded by Orestes and Iphigenia after they fled from the Tauri. In this tradition, the Nemi sanctuary was supposedly built on the pattern of an earlier Temple of Artemis Tauropolos, and the first cult statue at Nemi was said to have been stolen from the Tauri and brought to Nemi by Orestes. Historical evidence suggests that worship of Diana at Nemi flourished from at least the 6th century BCE until the 2nd century CE. Her cult there was first attested in Latin literature by Cato the Elder, in a surviving quote by the late grammarian Priscian. By the 4th century BCE, the simple shrine at Nemi had been joined by a temple complex. The sanctuary served an important political role as it was held in common by the Latin League.\n\nA festival to Diana, the Nemoralia, was held yearly at Nemi on the Ides of August (August 13–15). Worshipers traveled to Nemi carrying torches and garlands, and once at the lake, they left pieces of thread tied to fences and tablets inscribed with prayers. Diana's festival eventually became widely celebrated throughout Italy, which was unusual given the provincial nature of Diana's cult. The poet Statius wrote of the festival:\n\nStatius describes the triple nature of the goddess by invoking heavenly (the stars), earthly (the grove itself) and underworld (Hecate) imagery. He also suggests by the garlanding of the dogs and polishing of the spears that no hunting was allowed during the festival.\n\nLegend has it that Diana's high priest at Nemi, known as the Rex Nemorensis, was always an escaped slave who could only obtain the position by defeating his predecessor in a fight to the death. Sir James George Frazer wrote of this sacred grove in \"The Golden Bough\", basing his interpretation on brief remarks in Strabo (5.3.12), Pausanias (2,27.24) and Servius' commentary on the \"Aeneid\" (6.136). The legend tells of a tree that stood in the center of the grove and was heavily guarded. No one was allowed to break off its limbs, with the exception of a runaway slave, who was allowed, if he could, to break off one of the boughs. He was then in turn granted the privilege to engage the Rex Nemorensis, the current king and priest of Diana, in a fight to the death. If the slave prevailed, he became the next king for as long as he could defeat his challengers. However, Joseph Fontenrose criticised Frazer's assumption that a rite of this sort actually occurred at the sanctuary, and no contemporary records exist that support the historical existence of the \"Rex Nemorensis\".\n\nRome hoped to unify into and control the Latin tribes around Nemi, so Diana's worship was imported to Rome as a show of political solidarity. Diana soon afterwards became Hellenized, and combined with the Greek goddess Artemis, \"a process which culminated with the appearance of Diana beside Apollo [the brother of Artemis] in the first \"lectisternium\" at Rome\" in 399 BCE. The process of identification between the two goddesses probably began when artists who were commissioned to create new cult statues for Diana's temples outside Nemi were struck by the similar attributes between Diana and the more familiar Artemis, and sculpted Diana in a manner inspired by previous depictions of Artemis. Sibyllene influence and trade with Massilia, where similar cult statues of Artemis existed, would have completed the process.\n\nAccording to Françoise Hélène Pairault's study, historical and archaeological evidence point to the fact that the characteristics given to both Diana of the Aventine Hill and Diana Nemorensis were the product of the direct or indirect influence of the cult of Artemis, which was spread by the Phoceans among the Greek towns of Campania Cuma and Capua, who in turn had passed it over to the Etruscans and the Latins by the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.\n\nEvidence suggests that a confrontation occurred between two groups of Etruscans who fought for supremacy, those from Tarquinia, Vulci and Caere (allied with the Greeks of Capua) and those of Clusium. This is reflected in the legend of the coming of Orestes to Nemi and of the inhumation of his bones in the Roman Forum near the temple of Saturn. The cult introduced by Orestes at Nemi is apparently that of the Artemis Tauropolos. The literary amplification reveals a confused religious background: different versions of Artemis were conflated under the epithet. As far as Nemi's Diana is concerned there are two different versions, by Strabo and Servius Honoratus. Strabo's version looks to be the most authoritative as he had access to first-hand primary sources on the sanctuaries of Artemis, i.e. the priest of Artemis Artemidoros of Ephesus. The meaning of \"Tauropolos\" denotes an Asiatic goddess with lunar attributes, lady of the herds. The only possible \"interpretatio graeca\" of high antiquity concerning \"Diana Nemorensis\" could have been the one based on this ancient aspect of a deity of light, master of wildlife. \"Tauropolos\" is an ancient epithet attached to Artemis, Hecate, and even Athena. According to the legend Orestes founded Nemi together with Iphigenia. At Cuma the Sybil is the priestess of both Phoibos and Trivia. Hesiod and Stesichorus tell the story according to which after her death Iphigenia was divinised under the name of Hecate, a fact which would support the assumption that Artemis Tauropolos had a real ancient alliance with the heroine, who was her priestess in Taurid and her human paragon. This religious complex is in turn supported by the triple statue of Artemis-Hecate.\n\nIn Rome, Diana was regarded with great reverence and was a patroness of lower-class citizens, called plebeians, as well as slaves, who could receive asylum in her temples. Georg Wissowa proposed that this might be because the first slaves of the Romans were Latins of the neighboring tribes. However, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus had the same custom of the asylum.\n\nWorship of Diana probably spread into the city of Rome beginning around 550 BCE, during her Hellenization and combination with the Greek goddess Artemis. Diana was first worshiped along with her brother and mother, Apollo and Latona, in their temple in the Campus Martius, and later in the Temple of Apollo Palatinus.\n\nThe first major temple dedicated primarily to Diana in the vicinity of Rome was the Temple of Diana Aventina (Diana of the Aventine Hill). According to the Roman historian Livy, the construction of this temple began in the 6th century BCE and was inspired by stories of the massive Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, which was said to have been built through the combined efforts of all the cities of Asia Minor. Legend has it that Servius Tullius was impressed with this act of massive political and economic cooperation, and convinced the cities of the Latin League to work with the Romans to build their own temple to the goddess. However, there is no compelling evidence for such an early construction of the temple, and it is more likely that it was built in the 3rd century BCE, following the influence of the temple at Nemi, and probably about the same time the first temples to Vertumnus (who was associated with Diana) were built in Rome (264 BCE). The misconception that the Aventine Temple was inspired by the Ephesian Temple might originate in the fact that the cult images and statues used at the former were based heavily on those found in the latter. Whatever its initial construction date, records show that the Avantine Temple was rebuilt by Lucius Cornificius in 32 BCE. If it was still in use by the 4th century CE, the Aventine temple would have been permanently closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Today, a short street named the \"Via del Tempio di Diana\" and an associated plaza, \"Piazza del Tempio di Diana\", commemorates the site of the temple. Part of its wall is located within one of the halls of the Apuleius restaurant.\n\nLater temple dedications often were based on the model for ritual formulas and regulations of the Temple of Diana. Roman politicians built several minor temples to Diana elsewhere in Rome to secure public support. One of these was built in the Campus Martius in 187 BCE; no Imperial period records of this temple have been found, and it is possible it was one of the temples demolished around 55 BCE in order to build a theater. Diana also had a public temple on the Quirinal Hill, the sanctuary of Diana Planciana. It was dedicated by Plancius in 55 BCE, though it is unclear which Plancius.\n\nIn their worship of Artemis, Greeks filled their temples with sculptures of the goddess created by well-known sculptors, and many were adapted for use in the worship of Diana by the Romans, beginning around the 2nd century BCE (the beginning of a period of strong Hellenistic influence on Roman religion). The earliest depictions of the Artemis of Ephesus are found on Ephesian coins from this period. By the Imperial period, small marble statues of the Ephesian Artemis were being produced in the Western region of the Mediterranean and were often bought by Roman patrons. The Romans obtained a large copy of an Ephesian Artemis statue for their temple on the Aventine Hill. Diana was usually depicted for educated Romans in her Greek guise. If she was shown accompanied by a deer, as in the \"Diana of Versailles\", this is because Diana was the patroness of hunting. The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of Acteon (or Actaeon), who saw her bathing naked. Diana transformed Acteon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to kill him.\n\nIn Campania, Diana had a major temple at Mount Tifata, near Capua. She was worshiped there as \"Diana Tifatina\". This was one of the oldest sanctuaries in Campania. As a rural sanctuary, it included lands and estates that would have been worked by slaves following the Roman conquest of Campania, and records show that expansion and renovation projects at her temple were funded in part by other conquests by Roman military campaigns. The modern Christian church of Sant'Angelo in Formis was built on the ruins of the Tifata temple.\n\nIn the Roman provinces, Diana was widely worshiped alongside local deities. Over 100 inscriptions to Diana have been cataloged in the provinces, mainly from Gaul, Upper Germania, and Britannia. Diana was commonly invoked alongside another forest god, Silvanus, as well as other \"mountain gods\". In the provinces, she was occasionally conflated with local goddesses such as Abnoba, and was given high status, with \"Augusta\" and \"regina\" (\"queen\") being common epithets.\n\nDiana was not only regarded as a goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, but was often worshiped as a patroness of families. She served a similar function to the hearth goddess Vesta, and was sometimes considered to be a member of the Penates, the deities most often invoked in household rituals. In this role, she was often given a name reflecting the tribe of family who worshiped her and asked for her protection. For example, in what is now Wiesbaden, Diana was worshiped as \"Diana Mattiaca\" by the Mattiaci tribe. Other family-derived named attested in the ancient literature include \"Diana Cariciana\", \"Diana Valeriana\", and \"Diana Plancia\". As a house goddess, Diana often became reduced in stature compared to her official worship by the Roman state religion. In personal or family worship, Diana was brought to the level of other household spirits, and was believed to have a vested interest in the prosperity of the household and the continuation of the family. The Roman poet Horace regarded Diana as a household goddess in his \"Odes\", and had an altar dedicated to her in his villa where household worship could be conducted. In his poetry, Horace deliberately contrasted the kinds of grand, elevated hymns to Diana on behalf of the entire Roman state, the kind of worship that would have been typical at her Aventine temple, with a more personal form of devotion.\n\nImages of Diana and her associated myths have been found on sarcophagi of wealthy Romans. They often included scenes depicting sacrifices to the goddess, and on at least one example, the deceased man is shown joining Diana's hunt.\n\nSince ancient times, philosophers and theologians have examined the nature of Diana in light of her worship traditions, attributes, mythology, and identification with other gods.\n\nDiana was initially a hunting goddess and goddess of the local woodland at Nemi, but as her worship spread, she acquired attributes of other similar goddesses. As she became conflated with Artemis, she became a moon goddess, identified with the other lunar goddesses goddess Luna and Hekate. She also became the goddess of childbirth and ruled over the countryside. Catullus wrote a poem to Diana in which she has more than one alias: Latonia, Lucina, Juno, Trivia, Luna.\n\nAlong with Mars, Diana was often venerated at games held in Roman amphitheaters, and some inscriptions from the Danubian provinces show that she was conflated with Nemesis in this role, as \"Diana Nemesis\".\n\nOutside of Italy, Diana had important centers of worship where she was syncretised with similar local deities in Gaul, Upper Germania, and Britannia. Diana was particularly important in the region in and around the Black Forest, where she was conflated with the local goddess Abnoba and worshiped as \"Diana Abnoba\".\n\nSome late antique sources went even further, syncretizing many local \"great goddesses\" into a single \"Queen of Heaven\". The Platonist philosopher Apuleius, writing in the late 2nd century, depicted the goddess declaring:\n\"I come, Lucius, moved by your entreaties: I, mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, first-born of the ages, highest of the gods, queen of the shades, first of those who dwell in heaven, representing in one shape all gods and goddesses. My will controls the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving sea-winds, and the mournful silences of hell; the entire world worships my single godhead in a thousand shapes, with divers rites, and under many a different name. The Phrygians, first-born of mankind, call me the Pessinuntian Mother of the gods; the native Athenians the Cecropian Minerva; the island-dwelling Cypriots Paphian Venus; the archer Cretans Dictynnan Diana; the triple-tongued Sicilians Stygian Proserpine; the ancient Eleusinians Actaean Ceres; some call me Juno, some Bellona, others Hecate, others Rhamnusia; but both races of Ethiopians, those on whom the rising and those on whom the setting sun shines, and the Egyptians who excel in ancient learning, honour me with the worship which is truly mine and call me by my true name: Queen Isis.\"\n\nLater poets and historians looked to Diana's identity as a triple goddess to merge her with triads heavenly, earthly, and underworld (cthonic) goddesses. Maurus Servius Honoratus said that the same goddess was called Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Proserpina in hell.\nMichael Drayton praises the Triple Diana in poem \"The Man in the Moone\" (1606): \"So these great three most powerful of the rest, Phoebe, Diana, Hecate, do tell. Her sovereignty in Heaven, in Earth and Hell\".\n\nBased on the earlier writings of Plato, the Neoplatonist philosophers of late antiquity united the various major gods of Hellenic tradition into a series of monads containing within them triads, with some creating the world, some animating it or bringing it to life, and others harmonizing it. Within this system, Proclus considered Diana to be one of the primary animating, or life-giving, deities. Proclus, citing Orphic tradition, concludes that Diana \"presides over all the generation in nature, and is the midwife of physical productive principles\" and that she \"extends these genitals, distributing as far as to subterranean natures the prolific power of [Bacchus].\" Specifically, Proclus considered the life-generating principle of the highest order, within the Intellectual realm, to be Rhea, who he identified with Ceres. Within her divinity was produced the cause of the basic principle of life. Projecting this principle into the lower, Hypercosmic realm of reality generated a lower monad, Kore, who could therefore be understood as Ceres' \"daughter\". Kore embodied the \"maidenly\" principle of generation that, more importantly, included a principle of division - where Demeter generates life indiscriminately, Kore distributes it individually. This division results in another triad or trinity, known as the Maidenly trinity, within the monad of Kore: namely, Diana, Proserpine, and Minerva, through whom individual living beings are given life and perfected. Specifically, according to a commentary by scholar Spyridon Rangos, Diana (equated with Hecate) gives existence, Proserpine (equated with \"Soul\") gives form, and Minerva (equated with \"Virtue\") gives intellect.\n\nIn his commentary on Proclus, the 19th century Platonist scholar Thomas Taylor expanded upon the theology of the classical philosophers, further interpreting the nature and roles of the gods in light of the whole body of Neoplatonist philosophy. He cites Plato in giving a three-form aspect to her central characteristic of virginity: the undefiled, the mundane, and the anagogic. Through the first form, Diana is regarded as a \"lover of virginity\". Through the second, she is the guardian of virtue. Through the third, she is considered to \"hate the impulses arising from generation.\" Through the principle of the undefiled, Taylor suggests that she is given supremacy in Proclus' triad of life-giving or animating deities, and in this role the theurgists called her Hekate. In this role, Diana is granted undefiled power (\"Amilieti\") from the other gods. This generative power does not proceed forth from the goddess (according to a statement by the Oracle of Delphi) but rather resides with her, giving her unparalleled virtue, and in this way she can be said to embody virginity. Later commentators on Proclus have clarified that the virginity of Diana is not an absence of sexual drive, but a renunciation of sexuality. Diana embodies virginity because she is the cause of fertile things, so logically, she herself cannot be fertile (within Neoplatonism, an important maxim is that \"every productive cause is superior to the nature of the produced effect\").\n\nUsing the ancient Neoplatonists as a basis, Taylor also commented on the triadic nature of Diana and related goddesses, and the ways in which they subsist within one another, partaking unevenly in each others powers and attributes. For example, Kore is said to embody both Diana/Hecate and Minerva, who create the virtuous or virgin power within her, but also Proserpine (her sole traditional identification), through whom the generative power of the Kore as a whole is able to proceed forth into the world, where it joins with the demiurge to produce further deities, including Bacchus and \"nine azure-eyed, flower-producing daughters\".\n\nProclus also included Artemis/Diana in a second triad of deities, along with Ceres and Juno. According to Proclus:\n\nProclus pointed to the conflict between Hera and Artmeis in the \"Illiad\" as a representation of the two kinds of human souls. Where Hera creates the higher, more cultured, or \"worthy\" souls, Artemis brings light to and perfects the \"less worthy\" or less rational. As explained by Ragnos (2000), \"The aspect of reality which Artemis and Hera share, and because of which they engage in a symbolic conflict, is the engendering of life.\" Hera elevates rational living beings up to intellectual rational existence, whereas Artemis' power pertains to human life as far as its physical existence as a living thing. \"Artemis deals with the most elementary forms of life or the most elementary part of all life, whereas Hera operates in the most elevated forms of life or the most elevated part of all life.\n\nSermons and other religious documents have provided evidence for the worship of Diana during the Middle Ages. Though few details have been recorded, enough references to Diana worship during the early Christian period exist to give some indication that it may have been relatively widespread among remote and rural communities throughout Europe, and that such beliefs persisted into the Merovingian period. References to contemporary Diana worship exist from the 6th century on the Iberian peninsula and what is now southern France, though more detailed accounts of Dianic cults were given for the Low Countries, and southern Belgium in particular. Many of these were probably local goddesses, and wood nymphs or dryads, which had been conflated with Diana by Christian writers Latinizing local names and traditions.\n\nThe 6th century bishop Gregory of Tours reported meeting with a deacon named Vulfilaic (also known as Saint Wulflaicus or Walfroy the Stylite), who founded a hermitage on a hill in what is now Margut, France. On the same hill, he found \"an image of Diana which the unbelieving people worshiped as a god.\" According to Gregory's report, worshipers would also sing chants in Diana's honor as they drank and feasted. Vulfilaic destroyed a number of smaller pagan statues in the area, but the statue of Diana was too large. After converting some of the local population to Christianity, Vulfilaic and a group of local residents attempted to pull the large statue down the mountain in order to destroy it, but failed, as it was too large to be moved. In Vulfilaic's account, after praying for a miracle, he was then able to single-handedly pull down the statue, at which point he and his group smashed it to dust with their hammers. According to Vulfilaic, this incident was quickly followed by an outbreak of pimples or sores that covered his entire body, which he attributed to demonic activity and similarly cured via what he described as a miracle. Vulfilaic would later found a church on the site, which is today known as Mont Saint-Walfroy.\n\nAdditional evidence for surviving pagan practices in the Low Countries region comes from the \"Vita Eligii\", or \"Life of Saint Eligius\", written by Audoin in the 7th century. Audoin drew together the familiar admonitions of Eligius to the people of Flanders. In his sermons, he denounced \"pagan customs\" that the people continued to follow. In particular, he denounced several Roman gods and goddesses alongside Druidic mythological beliefs and objects:\n\n\"I denounce and contest, that you shall observe no sacrilegious pagan customs. For no cause or infirmity should you consult magicians, diviners, sorcerers or incantators. ..Do not observe auguries ... No influence attaches to the first work of the day or the [phase of the] moon. ... [Do not] make vetulas, little deer or iotticos or set tables at night or exchange New Year gifts or supply superfluous drinks... No Christian... performs solestitia or dancing or leaping or diabolical chants. No Christian should presume to invoke the name of a demon, not Neptune or Orcus or Diana or Minerva or Geniscus...

No one should tell fate or fortune or horoscopes by them as those do who believe that a person must be what he was born to be.\"\n\nLegends from medieval Belgium concern a natural spring which came to be known as the \"Fons Remacli\", a location which may have been home to late-surviving worship of Diana. Remacle was a monk appointed by Eligius to head a monastery at Solignac, and he is reported to have encountered Diana worship in the area around the river Warche. The population in this region was said to have been involved in the worship of \"Diana of the Ardennes\" (a syncretism of Diana and the Celtic goddess Arduinna), with effigies and \"stones of Diana\" used as evidence of pagan practices. Remacle believed that demonic entities were present in the spring, and had caused it to run dry. He performed and exorcism of the water source, and installed a lead pipe, which allowed the water to flow again.\n\nDiana is the only pagan goddess mentioned by name in the New Testament (Acts 19). As a result, she became associated with many folk beliefs involving goddess-like supernatural figures that Catholic clergy wished to demonize. In the Middle Ages, legends of night-time processions of spirits led by a female figure are recorded in the church records of Northern Italy, western Germany, and southern France. The spirits were said to enter houses and consume food which then miraculously re-appeared. They would sing and dance, and dispense advise regarding healing herbs and the whereabouts of lost objects. If the house was in good order, they would bring fertility and plenty. If not, they would bring curses to the family. Some women reported participating in these processions while their bodies still lay in bed. Historian Carlo Ginzburg has referred to these legendary spirit gatherings as \"The Society of Diana\".\n\nLocal clergy complained that women believed they were following Diana or Herodias, riding out on appointed nights to join the processions or carry out instructions from the goddess. The earliest reports of these legends appear in the writings of Regino of Prüm in the year 899, followed by many additional reports and variants of the legend in documents by Ratherius and others. By 1310, the names of the goddess figures attached to the legend were sometimes combined as Herodiana. It is likely that the clergy of this time used the identification of the procession's leader as Diana or Herodias in order to fit an older folk belief into a Biblical framework, as both are featured and demonized in the New Testament. Herodias was often conflated with her daughter Salome in legend, which also holds that, upon being presented with the severed head of John the Baptist, she was blown into the air by wind from the saint's mouth, through which she continued to wander for eternity. Diana was often conflated with Hecate, a goddess associated with the spirits of the dead and with witchcraft. These associations, and the fact that both figures are attested to in the Bible, made them a natural fit for the leader of the ghostly procession. Clergy used this identification to assert that the spirits were evil, and that the women who followed them were inspired by demons. As was typical of this time period, though pagan beliefs and practices were near totally eliminated from Europe, the clergy and other authorities still treated paganism as a real threat, in part thanks to biblical influence; much of the Bible had been written when various forms of paganism were still active if not dominant, so medieval clergy applied the same kinds of warnings and admonitions for any non-standard folk beliefs and practices they encountered. Based on analysis of church documents and parishioner confessions, it is likely that the spirit identified by the Church as Diana or Herodias was called by names of pre-Christian figures like Holda (a Germanic goddess of the winter solstice), or with names referencing her bringing of prosperity, like the Latin Abundia (meaning \"plenty\"), Satia (meaning \"full\" or \"plentiful\") and the Italian Richella (meaning \"rich\"). Some of the local titles for her, such as \"bonae res\" (meaning \"good things\"), are similar to late classical titles for Hecate, like \"bona dea\". This might indicate a cultural mixture of medieval folk ideas with holdovers from earlier pagan belief systems. Whatever her true origin, by the 13th century, the leader of the legendary spirit procession had come to be firmly identified with Diana and Herodias through the influence of the Church.\n\nIn his wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, \"The Golden Bough\", anthropologist James George Frazer drew on various lines of evidence to re-interpret the legendary rituals associated with Diana at Nemi, particularly that of the \"rex Nemorensis\". Frazer developed his ideas in relation to J. M. W. Turner's painting, also titled \"The Golden Bough\", depicting a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of Nemi. According to Frazer, the \"rex Nemorensis\" or king at Nemi was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who participated in a mystical marriage to a goddess. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claimed that this motif of death and rebirth is central to nearly all of the world's religions and mythologies. In Frazer's theory, Diana functioned as a goddess of fertility and childbirth, who, assisted by the sacred king, ritually returned life to the land in spring. The king in this scheme served not only as a high priest but as a god of the grove. Frazer identifies this figure with Virbius, of which little is known, but also with Jupiter via an association with sacred oak trees. Frazer argued furthermore that Jupiter and Juno were simply duplicate names of Jana and Janus; that is, Diana and Dianus, all of whom had identical functions and origins.\n\nFrazer's speculatively reconstructed folklore of Diana's origins and the nature of her cult at Nemi were not well received even by his contemporaries. Godfrey Lienhardt noted that even during Frazer's lifetime, other anthropologists had \"for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions\", and that the lasting influence of \"The Golden Bough\" and Frazer's wider body of work \"has been in the literary rather than the academic world.\" Robert Ackerman wrote that, for anthropologists, Frazer is \"an embarrassment\" for being \"the most famous of them all\" and that most distance themselves from his work. While \"The Golden Bough\" achieved wide \"popular appeal\" and exerted a \"disproportionate\" influence \"on so many [20th century] creative writers\", Frazer's ideas played \"a much smaller part\" in the history of academic social anthropology.\n\nFolk legends like the Society of Diana, which linked the goddess to forbidden gatherings of women with spirits, may have influenced later works of folklore. One of these is Charles Godfrey Leland's \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", which prominently featured Diana at the center of an Italian witch-cult. In Leland's interpretation of supposed Italian folk witchcraft, Diana is considered Queen of the Witches. In this belief system, Diana is said to have created the world of her own being having in herself the seeds of all creation yet to come. It was said that out of herself she divided the darkness and the light, keeping for herself the darkness of creation and creating her brother Lucifer. Diana was believed to have loved and ruled with her brother, and with him bore a daughter, Aradia (a name likely derived from Herodias), who leads and teaches the witches on earth.\n\nLeland's claim that \"Aradia\" represented an authentic tradition from an underground witch-cult, which had secretly worshiped Diana since ancient times has been dismissed by most scholars of folklore, religion, and medieval history. After the 1921 publication of Margaret Murray's \"The Witch-cult in Western Europe\", which hypothesized that the European witch trials were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival, American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon's 1929 book \"Witches Still Live\" connected Murray's thesis with the witchcraft religion in \"Aradia\". Arguments against Murray's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar Jeffrey Russell devoted some of his 1980 book \"A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans\" to arguing against the claims Leland presented in \"Aradia\". Historian Elliot Rose's \"A Razor for a Goat\" dismissed \"Aradia\" as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion. In his book \"Triumph of the Moon\", historian Ronald Hutton doubted not only of the existence of the religion that \"Aradia\" claimed to represent, and that the traditions Leland presented were unlike anything found in actual medieval literature, but also of the existence of Leland's sources, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily \"duped\". Religious scholar Chas S. Clifton took exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounted to an accusation of \"serious literary fraud\" made by an \"argument from absence\".\n\nBuilding on the work of Frazer, Murray, and others, some 20th and 21st century authors have attempted to identify links between Diana and more localized deities. R. Lowe Thompson, for example, in his 2013 book \"The History of the Devil\", speculated that Diana may have been linked as an occasional \"spouse\" to the Gaulish horned god Cernunnos. Thompson suggested that Diana in her role as wild goddess of the hunt would have made a fitting consort for Cernunnos in Western Europe, and further noted the link between Diana as Proserpina with Pluto, the Greek god associated with the riches of the earth who served a similar role to the Gaulish Cernunnos.\n\nBecause Leland's claims about an Italian witch-cult are questionable, the first verifiable worship of Diana in the modern age was probably begun by Wicca. The earliest known practitioners of Neopagan witchcraft were members of a tradition begun by Gerald Gardner. Published versions of the devotional materials used by Gardner's group, dated to 1949, are heavily focused on the worship of Aradia, the daughter of Diana in Leland's folklore. Diana herself was recognized as an aspect of a single \"great goddess\" in the tradition of Apuleius, as described in the Wiccan Charge of the Goddess (itself adapted from Leland's text). Some later Wiccans, such as Scott Cunningham, would replace Aradia with Diana as the central focus of worship.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Victor Henry Anderson founded the Feri Tradition, a form of Wicca that draws from both Charles Leland's folklore and the Gardnerian tradition. Anderson claimed that he had first been initiated into a witchcraft tradition as a child in 1926, and that he had been told the name of the goddess worshiped by witches was Tana. The name Tana originated in Leland's \"Aradia\", where he claimed it was an old Etruscan name for Diana. The Feri Tradition founded by Anderson continues to recognize Tana/Diana as an aspect of the Star Goddess related to the element of fire, and representing \"the fiery womb that gives birth to and transforms all matter.\" (In \"Aradia\", Diana is also credited as the creatrix of the material world and Queen of Faeries).\n\nA few Wiccan traditions would elevate Diana to a more prominent position of worship, and there are two distinct modern branches of Wicca focused primarily on Diana. The first, founded during the early 1970s in the United States by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts, has a feminist theology and only occasionally accepts male participants, and leadership is limited to female priestesses. McFarland Dianic Wiccans base their tradition primarily on the work of Robert Graves and his book \"The White Goddess\", and were inspired by references to the existence of medieval European \"Dianic cults\" in Margaret Murray's book \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\". The second Dianic tradition, founded by Zsuzsanna Budapest in the mid 1970s, is characterized by an exclusive focus on the feminine aspect of the divine, and as a result is exclusively female. This tradition combines elements from British Traditional Wicca, Italian folk-magic based on the work of Charles Leland, feminist values, and healing practices drawn from a variety of different cultures.\n\nA third Neopagan tradition heavily inspired by the worship of Diana through the lens of Italian folklore is Stregheria, founded in the 1980s. It centers around a pair of deities regarded as divine lovers, who are known by several variant names including Diana and Dianus, alternately given as Tana and Tanus or Jana and Janus (the later two deity names were mentioned by James Frazer in \"The Golden Bough\" as later corruptions of Diana and Dianus, which themselves were alternate and possibly older names for Juno and Jupiter). The tradition was founded by author Raven Grimassi, and influenced by Italian folktales he was told by his mother. One such folktale describes the moon being impregnated by her lover the morning star, a parallel to Leland's mythology of Diana and her lover Lucifer.\n\nDiana was also a subject of worship in certain Feraferian rites, particularly those surrounding the autumnal equinox, beginning in 1967.\n\nBoth the Romanian words for \"fairy\" \"Zână\" and Sânziană, the Leonese and Portuguese word for \"water nymph\" \"xana\", and the Spanish word for \"shooting target\" and \"morning call\" (\"diana\") seem to come from the name of Diana.\n\nSince the Renaissance, Diana's myths have often been represented in the visual and dramatic arts, including the opera \"L'arbore di Diana\". In the 16th century, Diana's image figured prominently at the châteaus of Fontainebleau, Chenonceau, & at Anet, in deference to Diane de Poitiers, mistress of Henri of France. At Versailles she was incorporated into the Olympian iconography with which Louis XIV, the Apollo-like \"Sun King\" liked to surround himself. Diana is also a character in the 1876 Léo Delibes ballet \"Sylvia\". The plot deals with Sylvia, one of Diana's nymphs and sworn to chastity, and Diana's assault on Sylvia's affections for the shepherd Amyntas.\n\nBULLET::::- In \"The Knight's Tale\" in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\", Emily prays to Diana to be spared from marriage to either Palamon or Arcite.\nBULLET::::- In \"Ode\" by John Keats, he writes 'Browsed by none but Dian's fawns' (line 12)\nBULLET::::- In the sonnet \"To Science\" by Edgar Allan Poe, science is said to have \"dragged Diana from her car\".\nBULLET::::- Diana Soren, the main character in Carlos Fuentes' novel \"Diana o la cazadora soltera\" (\"Diana, or The Lone Huntress\"), is described as having the same personality as the goddess.\nBULLET::::- In \"Castaway\" by Augusta Webster, women who claim they are virtuous despite never having been tempted are referred to as \"Dianas.\" (Line 128)\nBULLET::::- In Jonathan Swift's poem: \"The Progress of Beauty\", as goddess of the moon, Diana is used in comparison to the 17th/early 18th century everyday woman Swift satirically writes about.

The character Hippolyta states \"And then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in Heaven\". She refers to Diana, goddess of the moon, who is often depicted with a silver hunting bow. In the same play the character Hermia is told by the Duke Theseus that she must either wed the character Demetrius \"Or on Diana's alter to protest for aye austerity and single life\". He refers to her becoming a nun, with the goddesse Diana having connotations of chastity.\nBULLET::::- In \"The Merchant of Venice\" Portia states \"I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will\".

Painters like Titian, Peter Paul Rubens, François Boucher, Nicholas Poussin and made use of her myth as a major theme. Most depictions of Diana in art featured the stories of Diana and Actaeon, or Callisto, or depicted her resting after hunting. Some famous work of arts with a Diana theme are:\nBULLET::::- \"Diana and Actaeon\", \"Diana and Callisto\", and \"Death of Actaeon\" by Titian.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana and Callisto\", \"Diana Returning from the Hunt\", \"Diana Resting After a Bath\", and \"Diana Getting Out of Bath\" by François Boucher.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana Bathing With Her Nymphs\" by Rembrandt.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana and Endymion\" by Poussin.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana and Callisto\", \"Diana and Her Nymph Departing From Hunt\", \"Diana and Her Nymphs Surprised By A Faun\" by Rubens.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana and Endymion\" by Johann Michael Rottmayr.\nBULLET::::- The famous fountain at Palace of Caserta, Italy, created by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari, depicting Diana being surprised by Acteon.\nBULLET::::- A sculpture by Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain can be seen at the Musée du Louvre.\nBULLET::::- \"Diana of the Tower\" a copper statue by Augustus Saint-Gaudens was created as the weather vane for the second Madison Square Garden in 1893.

{"id": "8397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8397", "title": "Danny Elfman", "text": "Danny Elfman\n\nDaniel Robert Elfman (born May 29, 1953) is an American composer, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor and voice actor. He first became well known as the singer-songwriter for the new wave band Oingo Boingo in the early 1980s, and has since garnered international recognition for writing over 100 feature film scores, as well as compositions for television, stage productions and the concert hall.\n\nElfman has frequently worked with directors Tim Burton, Sam Raimi and Gus Van Sant, with notable achievements the scores for 17 of Burton's films including \"Batman,\" \"Edward Scissorhands, Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Dumbo\"; Raimi's \"Spider-Man\", \"Spider-Man 2\", and \"Oz the Great and Powerful\"; and Van Sant's Academy Award-nominated films \"Good Will Hunting\" and \"Milk\". He wrote music for all of the \"Men in Black\" and \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" franchise films, the songs and score for the Burton-produced animated musical \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", and the themes for the popular television series \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"The Simpsons\".\n\nAmong his honors are four Oscar nominations, two Emmy Awards, a Grammy, six Saturn Awards for Best Music, the 2002 Richard Kirk Award, and the Disney Legend Award in 2015.\n\nElfman was born on May 29, 1953, in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family with Polish and Russian roots. He is the son of Blossom Elfman (née Bernstein), a writer and teacher, and Milton Elfman, a teacher who was in the Air Force. Elfman was raised in a racially mixed affluent community in Baldwin Hills, California, where he spent much of his time at the local movie theater discovering classic sci-fi, fantasy and horror films and first noticed the music of such film composers as Bernard Herrmann and Franz Waxman.\n\nIn his early school days, Elfman exhibited an aptitude for science with almost no interest in music, and was even rejected from elementary school orchestra \"for having no propensity for music.\" This would change when he switched high schools in the late 1960s and fell in with a musical crowd, who introduced him to early jazz and the work of Stravinsky and his 20th century contemporaries.\n\nAfter finishing high school early with plans to travel the world, Elfman followed his brother Richard to France, where he performed violin with Jérôme Savary's Le Grand Magic Circus, an avant-garde musical theater group. He then embarked on a ten-month, self-guided tour through Africa, busking and collecting a range of West African percussion instruments until he fell ill and was forced to return home. At this time, Richard was forming a new musical theater group in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Elfman was never officially a student at CalArts, an instructor in the Indonesian music department encouraged him to attend classes and perform music there for two years.\n\nAfter returning to Los Angeles from Africa in the early 1970s, Elfman was asked by his brother Richard to serve as musical director of his street theatre performance art troupe The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.\n\nElfman was tasked with adapting and arranging 1920s and 1930s jazz and big band music by artists such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Django Reinhardt and Josephine Baker for the ensemble, which consisted of up to 15 performers swapping 30 instruments. He also composed original pieces and helped build instruments unique for the group, including an aluminum gamelan, the 'Schlitz celeste' made from tuned beer cans, and a \"junkyard orchestra\" built from car parts and trash cans.\n\nThe Mystic Knights performed on the street and in nightclubs throughout Los Angeles until Richard left in 1979 to pursue filmmaking. As a send-off to the group's original concept, Richard created the film \"Forbidden Zone\" based on The Mystic Knights' stage performances. Elfman composed the songs and his first score for the film, and appeared as the character Satan, who performs a reworked version of Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher\" with ensemble members playing backup as henchmen.\n\nBefore the release of \"Forbidden Zone\", Elfman had taken over The Mystic Knights as lead singer-songwriter in 1979, paring the group down to eight players, shortening the name to Oingo Boingo, and recording and touring as a ska-influenced new wave band. Their biggest success among eight studio albums penned by Elfman was 1985's \"Dead Man's Party\", featuring the hit song \"Weird Science\" from the movie of the same name. The band also appeared performing their single \"Dead Man's Party\" in the 1986 movie \"Back to School\", for which Elfman also composed the score. Elfman shifted the band to a more guitar-oriented rock sound in the late 1980s, which continued through their last album \"Boingo\" in 1994.\n\nCiting permanent hearing damage from performing live and conflicts with his film-scoring career, Elfman retired Oingo Boingo in 1995 with a series of five sold-out final concerts at the Universal Amphitheatre ending on Halloween night. On October 31, 2015, Elfman and Oingo Boingo guitarist Steve Bartek performed the song \"Dead Man's Party\" with an orchestra as an encore to a live-to-film concert of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" score at the Hollywood Bowl. Elfman told the audience the performance was \"20 years to the day\" of Oingo Boingo's retirement.\n\nAs fans of Oingo Boingo and The Mystic Knights respectively, Tim Burton and Paul Reubens invited Elfman to write the score for their first feature film \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" in 1985. Elfman was initially apprehensive because of his lack of formal training and having never scored a studio feature, but after Burton accepted his initial demo of the title music and with orchestration assistance from Oingo Boingo guitarist and arranger Steve Bartek, he completed his score to great effect, while paying homage to his love of early film music and influential film composers Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann. Elfman described the first time he heard his music played by a full orchestra as one of the most thrilling experiences of his life.\n\nFollowing \"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\", Elfman scored mainly quirky comedies in the late 1980s, including \"Back to School\" starring Rodney Dangerfield, Burton's \"Beetlejuice\" and the Bill Murray vehicle \"Scrooged\". Notable exceptions were the all-synth score to Emilio Estevez's crime drama \"Wisdom\" and the big band, blues-infused music for Martin Brest's buddy cop action film \"Midnight Run\".\n\nIn 1989, Elfman's influential, Grammy-winning score for Burton's \"Batman\" marked a major stylistic shift to dark, densely orchestrated music in the romantic idiom, which would carry over to his scores for Warren Beatty's \"Dick Tracy\", Sam Raimi's \"Darkman\" and Clive Barker's \"Nightbreed\", all released in 1990.\n\nWith \"Batman\", Elfman firmly established a career-spanning relationship with Burton, scoring all but three of the director's major studio releases. Highlights include \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990), \"Batman Returns\" (1992), \"Sleepy Hollow\" (1999), \"Big Fish\" (2003) and \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010). In 2005 he wrote the score and songs for Burton's \"Corpse Bride\" and provided the voice of the character of Bonejangles, as well as providing the score, songs and Oompa-Loompa vocals for Burton's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" that same year. In addition to writing the score and ten songs for the Burton-produced stop motion animated film \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", Elfman also provided the singing voice for main character Jack Skellington, as well as the voices for side characters Barrel and the Clown with the Tear-Away Face.\n\nIn addition to frequent collaborations with Burton, Raimi and Gus Van Sant, Elfman has worked with esteemed directors such as Brian De Palma, Peter Jackson, Joss Whedon, Errol Morris, Ang Lee, Richard Donner, Guillermo del Toro, David O. Russell, Taylor Hackford, Jon Amiel, Joe Johnston, and Barry Sonnenfeld. His scores for Sonnenfeld's \"Men in Black\", Van Sant's \"Good Will Hunting\" and \"Milk\", and Burton's \"Big Fish\" all received Academy Award nominations.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, Elfman has expanded his craft to a range of genres, including thrillers (\"Dolores Claiborne\", \"A Simple Plan\", \"The Kingdom\"), dramas (\"Sommersby\", \"A Civil Action\", \"Hitchcock\"), indies (\"Freeway\", \"Silver Linings Playbook\", \"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot\"), family (\"Flubber\", \"Charlotte's Web\", \"Frankenweenie\", \"Goosebumps\"), documentary (\"Standard Operating Procedure\", \"The Unknown Known\"), and straight horror (\"Red Dragon\", \"The Wolfman\"), as well as notable entries in his well-established areas of horror comedy (\"The Frighteners\", \"Mars Attacks!\", \"Dark Shadows\") and comic book-inspired action films (\"Hulk\", \"Wanted\", \"\", \"\").\n\nAmong his franchise work, Elfman composed the scores for all four \"Men in Black\" films (1997-2019) and all three \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" films (2015–2018). Elfman scored Raimi's \"Spider-Man\" in 2002 and \"Spider-Man 2\" in 2004, themes and selections from which were used for Raimi's \"Spider-Man 3\", though Elfman did not compose the score. In 1996, he also provided the score for the first film in the , adapting themes for the original television series by Lalo Schifrin as well as composing his own.\n\nFor several high-profile sequel and reboot projects in the 2010s, Elfman incorporated established musical themes with his own original thematic material, including the DC Extended Universe's \"Justice League\", \"The Grinch,\" \"Dumbo\" and .\n\nElfman was featured in the 2016 documentary \"Score\", in which he appeared among over 50 film composers to discuss the craft of movie music and influential figures in the business.\n\nElfman's first piece of original concert music, \"Serenada Schizophrana\", was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra, who premiered the piece on February 23, 2005, at Carnegie Hall. Subsequent concert works include his first \"Violin Concerto \"Eleven Eleven\"\", co-commissioned by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Live at Stanford University, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, which premiered at Smetana Hall in Prague on June 21, 2017, with Sandy Cameron on violin and John Mauceri conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra; the \"Piano Quartet\", co-commissioned by the Lied Center for Performing Arts University of Nebraska and the Berlin Philharmonic Piano Quartet, which premiered February 6, 2018, in Lincoln, Nebraska; and the \"Percussion Quartet\", commissioned by Third Coast Percussion and premiered at the Philip Glass Days And Nights Festival in Big Sur on October 10, 2019.\n\nIn 2008, Elfman accepted his first commission for the stage, composing the music for Twyla Tharp's \"Rabbit and Rogue\" ballet, co-commissioned by American Ballet Theatre and Orange County Performing Arts Center and premiering on June 3, 2008, at the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center. Other works for stage include the music for Cirque Du Soleil's \"Iris\" in 2011, and incidental music for the Broadway production of Taylor Mac's \"\" in 2019.\n\nIn October 2013, Elfman returned to the stage for the first time since his band Oingo Boingo disbanded to sing his vocal parts to a handful of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" songs as part of a concert titled \"Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton\", featuring suites of music from 15 Tim Burton films newly arranged by Elfman. The concert has since toured internationally and has played in Japan, Australia, Mexico and throughout Europe and the United States. Since 2015, Elfman has appeared annually in a Hollywood Bowl Halloween concert featuring full orchestra performing the \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" score live to the film.\n\nIn 2019 it was announced Elfman had been commissioned to write a piece for the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain set to premiere in 2020, and a percussion concerto for Colin Currie and the London Philharmonic Orchestra for spring 2021. Other works in the planning phase are a cello concerto and a project that involves chamber orchestra and Elfman's own voice.\n\nIn addition to his music for film, Elfman has had a prolific career in television, penning themes for the \"The Simpsons\", \"Tales from the Crypt\", \"The Flash\" and \"Desperate Housewives\", which won Elfman his first Emmy. He also adapted his original themes for the animated versions of \"\" and \"Beetlejuice\". Occasional forays into serial television include episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"Amazing Stories\" and Pee-wee's Playhouse, as well as the miniseries \"When We Rise\", co-composed with Chris Bacon.\n\nHe has composed music for animated shorts, including Sally Cruikshank's \"Face Like A Frog\" and Tim Burton's \"Stainboy\" internet series.\n\nElfman provided background music for Luigi Serafini's solo exhibition \"il Teatro della Pittura\" at the Fondazione Mudima di Milano in Milan, Italy in 1998 and for the \"Tim Burton\" exhibition at MoMA in 2009.\n\nIn the 1990s, Elfman composed music for advertising campaigns for Nike, Nissan and Lincoln-Mercury, and in 2002 wrote the music for Honda's \"Power of Dreams\" advertising campaign, which was the first cinema commercial to be shot in the IMAX format.\n\nIn 2013 he composed the music and provided the English-language vocals for the Hong Kong Disneyland attraction Mystic Manor.\n\nOn October 31, 2019, the MasterClass online educational series released Elfman's episode \"Making Music out of Chaos,\" presenting 21 compositional and career lessons from Elfman's four decades of experience primarily in the film industry.\n\nElfman has said his major influences are composers from Hollywood's Golden Age, such as Bernard Herrmann, Dimitri Tiomkin, Max Steiner, David Tamkin, Erich Korngold and Carl Stalling; 20th century classical composers Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Carl Orff; and jazz, experimental and minimalist composers Kurt Weill, Duke Ellington, Harry Partch, Philip Glass, Lou Harrison, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. Influences on specific scores include Erik Satie (\"Forbidden Zone)\", Nino Rota (\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\"), George Gershwin (\"Dick Tracy\"), Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (\"Edward Scissorhands\"), and Jimi Hendrix (\"Dead Presidents\"). Though not considered direct influences \"per se\", Elfman has discussed his respect and admiration for film composers Jerry Goldsmith, Ennio Morricone, Thomas Newman, Alexandre Desplat and John Williams, as well as classical composer John Adams.\n\nThough many believe Richard Wagner informed his influential score to \"Batman\", Elfman has said it was more likely from Wagner's influence on classic film composers such as Herrmann, Steiner, Waxman and Korngold, as he was unfamiliar with Wagner's work at the time.\n\nElfman counts Herrmann as his biggest influence, and has said hearing Herrmann's score to \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" when he was a child was the first time he recognized film music as a cinematic artform and realized the powerful contribution a composer makes to the movies. Pastiche of Herrmann's music can be heard in Elfman's \"Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure,\" especially the cues \"Stolen Bike\" and \"Clown Attack\", which directly reference Herrmann's music from \"Psycho\" and \"7th Voyage of Sinbad\" respectively. His score to \"Batman\" makes more subtle nods to Herrmann's \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" and \"Vertigo\", and more integral homage can be heard in later scores for \"Mars Attacks!\" and \"Hitchcock,\" as well as the \"Blue Strings\" movement of his first concert work \"Serenada Schizophrana\".\n\nWhile Elfman is primarily known for writing large-scale orchestral works in the romantic, 20th century and Hollywood Golden Age film score traditions, his compositions have utilized a wide range of idioms, including rock and blues (\"Midnight Run, Hot to Trot\"), big band and jazz (\"Dick Tracy\", \"Chicago\"), operetta (\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", \"Corpse Bride\"), funk and hip hop (\"Dead Presidents\", \"Notorious\"), folk and indie rock (\"Taking Woodstock\", \"Silver Linings Playbook\"), Americana (\"Article 99\", \"Sommersby\", \"Big Fish),\" minimalism (\"Good Will Hunting\", \"Standard Operating Procedure\", \"The Unknown Known\"), and atonal or experimental (\"Freeway\", \"A Simple Plan, The Girl on the Train\").\n\nGiven his appreciation and study of world music and his vast collection of instruments from non-Western cultures, Elfman will often use traditional instruments in his scores when there is an international setting, such as African percussion for \"Instinct,\" the oud for \"The Kingdom\" set in Saudi Arabia, and pan flute for \"Proof of Life\" set in South America.\n\nWhen working on films with established musical identifiers, Elfman will often incorporate original themes in addition to his own thematic material. Examples include Lalo Schifrin's main theme and \"The Plot\" from the original for \"\"; John Williams' theme for \"Superman\", the Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL theme for \"Wonder Woman\" and his own original \"Batman\" theme for \"Justice League;\" the \"Welcome Christmas\" song from the 1966 \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" for \"The Grinch\"; and “Casey Junior,\" “Pink Elephants on Parade,” and “When I See an Elephant Fly” from Disney's original 1941 animated film for \"Dumbo\".\n\nEven when not directly quoting themes from related films, Elfman will often pay homage through established musical gesture or tonality, for example Howard Shore's \"The Silence of the Lambs\" for \"Red Dragon\", Brad Fiedel's music for the \"Terminator\" franchise for \"Terminator Salvation\", Robert Cobert's original television series music for \"Dark Shadows,\" and Alan Silvestri's work on \"The Avengers\" for the sequel \"\". Notable exceptions are Tim Burton's \"Batman\", \"Planet of the Apes\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" which do not make musical reference to pre existing material.\n\nElfman's work in pop music and specifically as songwriter for Oingo Boingo was influenced by The Specials, Madness, the Selecter, and XTC.\n\nThe songs for \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and \"Corpse Bride\" were overarchingly influenced by Kurt Weill, Gilbert and Sullivan and early Rodgers and Hammerstein, whereas the songs in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" were influenced by Bollywood, The Mamas and the Papas, Earth, Wind & Fire, ABBA, and Queen individually.\n\nFor his film scores, Elfman draws musical inspiration almost exclusively from viewing a cut of the film, and occasionally from visits to the set while the film is in production (he famously wrote and orchestrated his theme for \"Batman\" on an airplane to Los Angeles after visiting the set in London). While he prefers not to work from script, story or concept, notable exceptions are \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" for which ten songs needed to be written in advance of filmmaking, and \"Dumbo,\" for which he composed the main theme before filming began.\n\nOnce a rough cut of the film is ready, Elfman and the director have a spotting session to decide where to place music in the film, the emotional undercurrents of each scene, and overall tone. Elfman then spends a few weeks of free composition and experimentation to begin working out thematic material and to develop sounds and the harmonic pallette.\n\nWhen he has received approval on initial material from the filmmakers, Elfman begins to compose anywhere from 60 to 120 minutes of music cue-by-cue. He says two of the most important things to capture at this point are the tone of each scene and editorial rhythm. Next to thematic development, action set pieces tend to take Elfman the most time given the complexity of timing music to action. One element where Elfman's compositional process deviates from most film composers is that he will often compose three or more often radically different versions of a single cue to give the director more options for musicalizing a scene.\n\nEarly in his career, he wrote out his scores using pencil, but has composed largely digitally since the mid-1990s.\n\nBefore recording the score, he demos each cue by mocking orchestral and choral parts on synthesizer to get approval from the director. Once approved, he provides a detailed, multi-line sketch of his composition to his lead orchestrator Steve Bartek, who ensures the sketches are appropriately broken down for sections of the orchestra (i.e. string, brass woodwind, some percussion), choir (SATB) and individual players.\n\nElfman also typically samples or records his own percussion and guitar playing to overlay with live orchestra. More than half of some scores feature Elfman's performance, including \"Dead Presidents\", \"\", \"Planet of the Apes\", \"The Kingdom\", \"The Girl on the Train\" and \"The Circle.\"\n\nTo produce the score, Elfman rents a recording studio and hires a conductor and orchestra/choir. He oversees the recording from the control booth so that he can troubleshoot with the film's director and recording engineers. The final recording is given to the film's sound department to mix with dialogue and sound effects for the film's complete soundtrack. Elfman will usually do a separate mix of select cues for an album presentation of the score, and has produced nearly 100 to date.\n\nOn the occasion that there are compressed deadlines or in the event he is not available to rescore or adapt his music if there are major edits to the film after the score's completion, Elfman will hire additional composers to work on small cues or sections of cues, adapting his existing material or themes. Examples include Jonathan Sheffer on \"Darkman\", David Buckley on the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" films, and Pinar Toprak on \"Justice League.\" Since the 1990s, Elfman has occasionally co-composed music or shared music writing credit (e.g.\"When We Rise\", \"Spy Kids\", \", \"), or written themes that are then used or adapted by other composers, including Jonathan Sheffer (\"Pure Luck\"), Steve Bartek (\"Novacaine\"), John Debney (\"Heartbreakers),\" Deborah Lurie (\"9\"), and The Newton Brothers (\"Before I Wake\").\n\nIn the liner notes for the 2006 CD recording of his first concert work \"Serenada Schizophrana\", Elfman wrote: \"I began composing several dozen short improvisational compositions, maybe a minute each. Slowly, some of them began to develop themselves until finally I had six separate movements that, in some abstract, absurd way, felt connected.\"\n\nTo create the cadenzas for his violin concerto \"Eleven Eleven\", Elfman collaborated with soloist Sandy Cameron, for whom the piece was written.\n\nElfman often incorporates choral or vocal arrangements into his film scores, notably the use of women's and children's choirs (\"Scrooged\", \"Nightbreed, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns\", \"Sleepy Hollow, Alice in Wonderland\", \"The Grinch\"), and solo voice or vocal effects (\"Beetlejuice\", \"Mars Attacks!\", \"Men in Black II\", \"Flubber\", \"Nacho Libre\", \"Iris\", \"Dark Shadows\", \"The Girl on the Train\"). Evoking the \"O Fortuna\" from Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\", he set made-up, Latin-sounding text for SATB choir in standout cue \"Descent Into Mystery\" from \"Batman.\"\n\nElfman also adds his own vocals into compositions in much the same way he mixes his percussion and guitar performances into orchestral arrangements. Prominent use can be heard in the scores for \"To Die For\" (sung with director Gus Van Sant, credited to \"Little Gus and the Suzettes\"), \"Silver Linings Playbook\", and his music for the Hong Kong Disneyland ride Mystic Manor. He provided the singing voice for characters in \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and \"Corpse Bride\" in addition to composing the scores and songs\",\" and can be heard singing the \"Day-O\" call in the style of Harry Belafonte's \"Banana Boat Song\" in the first bars of the \"Beetlejuice\" main title.\n\nFor Tim Burton's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" Elfman set Roald Dahl's text for the Oompa-Loompa characters as four stylistically distinct songs: the Bollywood-influenced \"Augustus Gloop,\" the funk-infused \"Violet Beauregarde,\" the psychedelic pop stylings of \"Veruca Salt,\" and the baroque rock of \"Mike Teevee.\" For all songs in the film, Elfman sang, manipulated and mixed several layers of his vocals to create the singing voices and harmonies of the Oompa Loompas, and incorporated his vocals into non-song score tracks that featured the characters, including \"Loompa Land,\" \"Chocolate River,\" \"The Boat Arrives,\" and \"The River Cruise.\"\n\nUnique among film composers, Elfman typically writes the lyrics to songs he has composed for movies. He employs song structures from Tin Pan Alley and early musical theatre composers (32-bar form), and pop and rock of the 1950s and 1960s (verse-chorus). As his songs serve to advance the plot and develop characters, lyrics reflect storylines and imagery specific to the film and express the inner life of characters.\n\nA major achievement was writing the lyrics and music for ten songs featured in the stop-motion musical \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". Drawing from Tim Burton's parody poem of \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" and concept drawings, Elfman wrote each song in consultation with Burton before the film even had a script. These include the full-cast songs \"This Is Halloween,\" \"Town Meeting Song,\" and \"Making Christmas\"; four songs for the main character Jack Skellington \"Jack's Lament,\" \"What's This,\" \"Jack's Obsession,\" and \"Poor Jack\" all sung by Elfman; and the other character songs \"Kidnap The Sandy Claws,\" \"Oogie Boogie's Song,\" and \"Sally's Song.\" An eleventh song, \"Finale/Reprise,\" reworks lyrics from the songs \"This Is Halloween,\" \"What's This\" and \"Sally's Song\" for the film's ending.\n\nThough uncredited, Burton contributed some lyrics to \"Nightmare\", including the line \"Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake\" in \"Town Meeting Song.\"\n\nElfman composed five songs for Burton's \"Corpse Bride\": \"According to Plan\" with lyrics co-written by screenwriter John August; \"Remains of the Day,\" which he sung as the character Bonejangles, and \"Tears To Shed,\" both with additional lyrics by August, and \"The Wedding Song\" credited solely to Elfman. The song \"Erased\" was not used in the final film.\n\nHe wrote the lyrics to \"Lullaby\" from \"Charlotte's Web\", the rock track \"The Little Things\" from \"Wanted\" which he also sang in English and Russian, and \"Alice's Theme\" from \"Alice in Wonderland\". Elfman co-wrote the music and lyrics to Batman Returns's \"Face To Face\" with Siouxsie and the Banshees, and co-wrote the lyrics to \"Twice The Love\" from \"Big Fish\" and the \"Wonka's Welcome Song\" for \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" with John August.\n\nElfman wrote the lyrics to all of Oingo Boingo's original songs 1979-1994, provided lyrics for Mike Oldfield's album \"Islands\" in 1987, and has made residuals on the titular two-word opening phrase sung in his \"The Simpsons\" theme since the series first aired in 1989.\n\nAs a teenager, Elfman dated his classmate Kim Gordon, who would later become one of the members of the rock band Sonic Youth.\n\nHe has two daughters, Lola (*1979) and Mali (*1984), from his marriage to Geri Eisenmenger. Mali is a film producer and actress. Elfman and his daughter collaborated on her 2011 film \"Do Not Disturb\".\n\nOn November 29, 2003, Elfman married actress Bridget Fonda. They have a son, Oliver.

{"id": "8398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8398", "title": "Dimension", "text": "Dimension\n\nIn physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.\n\nIn classical mechanics, space and time are different categories and refer to absolute space and time. That conception of the world is a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. The four dimensions of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe superstring theory, eleven dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory, and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space.\n\nThe concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. s frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be parameter spaces or configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space we live in.\n\nIn mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of degrees of freedom of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent parameters or coordinates that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a line is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a plane is two, etc.\n\nThe dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a curve, such as a circle is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension lower than two, unless it is a line.\n\nThe dimension of Euclidean -space is . When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question \"what makes -dimensional?\" One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in by small balls of radius , one needs on the order of such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension, but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in looks locally like and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension. While these notions agree on , they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.\n\nA tesseract is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term \"dimension\" is as in: \"A tesseract \"has four dimensions\"\", mathematicians usually express this as: \"The tesseract \"has dimension 4\"\", or: \"The dimension of the tesseract \"is\" 4\".\n\nAlthough the notion of higher dimensions goes back to René Descartes, substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of Arthur Cayley, William Rowan Hamilton, Ludwig Schläfli and Bernhard Riemann. Riemann's 1854 Habilitationsschrift, Schläfli's 1852 \"Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität\", and Hamilton's discovery of the quaternions and John T. Graves' discovery of the octonions in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.\n\nThe rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the cardinality of a basis) is often referred to as the \"Hamel dimension\" or \"algebraic dimension\" to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.\n\nFor the non-free case, this generalizes to the notion of the length of a module.\n\nThe uniquely defined dimension of every connected topological manifold can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean -space, in which the number is the manifold's dimension.\n\nFor connected differentiable manifolds, the dimension is also the dimension of the tangent vector space at any point.\n\nIn geometric topology, the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the high-dimensional cases are simplified by having extra space in which to \"work\"; and the cases and are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the Poincaré conjecture, where four different proof methods are applied.\n\nThe dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined. While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the real numbers, it is sometimes useful in the study of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties to work over the complex numbers instead. A complex number (\"x\" + \"iy\") has a real part \"x\" and an imaginary part \"y\", where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.\n\nConversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions. For example, an ordinary two-dimensional spherical surface, when given a complex metric, becomes a Riemann sphere of one complex dimension.\n\nThe dimension of an algebraic variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the tangent space at any Regular point of an algebraic variety. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of hyperplanes that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.\n\nAn algebraic set being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains formula_1 of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of \"formula_2\").\n\nEach variety can be considered as an algebraic stack, and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if \"V\" is a variety of dimension \"m\" and \"G\" is an algebraic group of dimension \"n\" acting on \"V\", then the quotient stack [\"V\"/\"G\"] has dimension \"m\" − \"n\".\n\nThe Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of chains of prime ideals in it, a chain of length \"n\" being a sequence formula_3 of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.\n\nFor an algebra over a field, the dimension as vector space is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.\n\nFor any normal topological space , the Lebesgue covering dimension of is defined to be the smallest integer \"n\" for which the following holds: any open cover has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than elements. In this case dim . For a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer exists, then the dimension of is said to be infinite, and one writes dim . Moreover, has dimension −1, i.e. dim if and only if is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all Tychonoff spaces merely by replacing the term \"open\" in the definition by the term \"functionally open\".\n\nAn inductive dimension may be defined inductively as follows. Consider a discrete set of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a \"new direction\", one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ()-dimensional object by dragging an -dimensional object in a \"new\" direction. The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the \"small inductive dimension\" or the \"large inductive dimension\", and is based on the analogy that, in the case of metric spaces, balls have -dimensional boundaries, permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets. Moreover, the boundary of a discrete set of points is the empty set, and therefore the empty set can be taken to have dimension -1.\n\nSimilarly, for the class of CW complexes, the dimension of an object is the largest for which the -skeleton is nontrivial. Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be continuously deformed into a collection of higher-dimensional triangles joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially fractals. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all metric spaces and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values. The box dimension or Minkowski dimension is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of fractal dimensions that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.\n\nEvery Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis, and any two such bases for a particular space have the same cardinality. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's Hamel dimension is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.\n\nClassical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; \"i.e.\", moving in a linear combination of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See Space and Cartesian coordinate system.)\n\n!style=\"width:7.5em;\" \n! Example co-ordinate systems\n!style=\"padding-right:1.0em;\" Number line\n!

Time is often referred to as the \"fourth dimension\" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move in one direction.\n\nThe equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time, and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy).\n\nThe best-known treatment of time as a dimension is Poincaré and Einstein's special relativity (and extended to general relativity), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional manifold, known as spacetime, and in the special, flat case as Minkowski space.\n\nIn physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four fundamental forces by introducing extra dimensions. Most notably, superstring theory requires 10 spacetime dimensions, and originates from a more fundamental 11-dimensional theory tentatively called M-theory which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be \"curled up\" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments such as those at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nAt the level of quantum field theory, Kaluza–Klein theory unifies gravity with gauge interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces electromagnetism. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe quantum gravity. Therefore, these models still require a UV completion, of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a Calabi–Yau manifold. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.\n\nIn addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be large extra dimensions. D-branes are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the brane by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or \"the bulk\". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.\n\nSome aspects of brane physics have been applied to cosmology. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.\n\nExtra dimensions are said to be universal if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.\n\nSome complex networks are characterized by fractal dimensions. The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space. The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.\n\nScience fiction texts often mention the concept of \"dimension\" when referring to parallel or alternate universes or other imagined planes of existence. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.\n\nOne of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella \"Flatland\" by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described \"Flatland\" as \"The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.\"\n\nThe idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in Miles J. Breuer's \"The Appendix and the Spectacles\" (1928) and Murray Leinster's \"The Fifth-Dimension Catapult\" (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s. Classic stories involving other dimensions include Robert A. Heinlein's \"—And He Built a Crooked House\" (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and Alan E. Nourse's \"Tiger by the Tail\" and \"The Universe Between\" (both 1951). Another reference is Madeleine L'Engle's novel \"A Wrinkle In Time\" (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for \"tesseracting the universe\" or \"folding\" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions are also a key component of the book \"The Boy Who Reversed Himself\" by William Sleator.\n\nImmanuel Kant, in 1783, wrote: \"That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition \"a priori\" because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain.\"\n\n\"Space has Four Dimensions\" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and experimental psychologist Gustav Fechner under the pseudonym \"Dr. Mises\". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this \"shadow-man\" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time. The story bears a strong similarity to the \"Allegory of the Cave\" presented in Plato's \"The Republic\" (c. 380 BC).\n\nSimon Newcomb wrote an article for the \"Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\" in 1898 entitled \"The Philosophy of Hyperspace\". Linda Dalrymple Henderson coined the term \"hyperspace philosophy\", used to describe writing that uses higher dimensions to explore metaphysical themes, in her 1983 thesis about the fourth dimension in early-twentieth-century art. Examples of \"hyperspace philosophers\" include Charles Howard Hinton, the first writer, in 1888, to use the word \"tesseract\"; and the Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky.\n\nZero\nBULLET::::- Point\nBULLET::::- Zero-dimensional space\nBULLET::::- Integer\nOne\nBULLET::::- Line\nBULLET::::- Curve\nBULLET::::- Graph (combinatorics)\nBULLET::::- Real number\nTwo\nBULLET::::- Complex number\nBULLET::::- Cartesian coordinate system\nBULLET::::- List of uniform tilings\nBULLET::::- Surface\nThree\nBULLET::::- Platonic solid\nBULLET::::- Stereoscopy (3-D imaging)\nBULLET::::- 3-manifold\nBULLET::::- Knots\nFour\nBULLET::::- Spacetime\nBULLET::::- Fourth spatial dimension\nBULLET::::- Convex regular 4-polytope\nBULLET::::- Quaternion\nBULLET::::- 4-manifold\nBULLET::::- Fourth dimension in art\nBULLET::::- Fourth dimension in literature\nHigher dimensionsin mathematics\nInfinite\nBULLET::::- Hilbert space\nBULLET::::- Function space\n\nBULLET::::- Katta G Murty, \"Systems of Simultaneous Linear Equations\" (Chapter 1 of \"Computational and Algorithmic Linear Algebra and n-Dimensional Geometry\", World Scientific Publishing: 2014 ().\nBULLET::::- Edwin A.

{"id": "8400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8400", "title": "Duodecimal", "text": "Duodecimal\n\nThe duodecimal system (also known as base 12, dozenal, or rarely uncial) is a positional notation numeral system using twelve as its base. The number twelve (that is, the number written as \"12\" in the base ten numerical system) is instead written as \"10\" in duodecimal (meaning \"1 dozen and 0 units\", instead of \"1 ten and 0 units\"), whereas the digit string \"12\" means \"1 dozen and 2 units\" (i.e. the same number that in decimal is written as \"14\"). Similarly, in duodecimal \"100\" means \"1 gross\", \"1000\" means \"1 great gross\", and \"0.1\" means \"1 twelfth\" (instead of their decimal meanings \"1 hundred\", \"1 thousand\", and \"1 tenth\").\n\nThe number twelve, a superior highly composite number, is the smallest number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the subitizing range, and the smallest abundant number. As a result of this increased factorability of the radix and its divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers (whereas ten has only two non-trivial factors: 2 and 5, and not 3, 4, or 6), duodecimal representations fit more easily than decimal ones into many common patterns, as evidenced by the higher regularity observable in the duodecimal multiplication table. As a result, duodecimal has been described as the optimal number system. Of its factors, 2 and 3 are prime, which means the reciprocals of all 3-smooth numbers (such as 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, ...) have a terminating representation in duodecimal. In particular, the five most elementary fractions (, , , and ) all have a short terminating representation in duodecimal (0.6, 0.4, 0.8, 0.3 and 0.9, respectively), and twelve is the smallest radix with this feature (because it is the least common multiple of 3 and 4). This all makes it a more convenient number system for computing fractions than most other number systems in common use, such as the decimal, vigesimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal systems. Although the trigesimal and sexagesimal systems (where the reciprocals of all 5-smooth numbers terminate) do even better in this respect, this is at the cost of unwieldy multiplication tables and a much larger number of symbols to memorize.\n\nVarious symbols have been used to stand for ten and eleven in duodecimal notation; the Unicode standard uses () and (), respectively. These were implemented in Unicode 8.0 (2015), but most general Unicode fonts in use by current operating systems and browsers have not yet included them. Using these symbols, a count from zero to twelve in duodecimal reads: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, , , 10. A more common alternative is to use A and B, as in hexadecimal.\n\nLanguages using duodecimal number systems are uncommon. Languages in the Nigerian Middle Belt such as Janji, Gbiri-Niragu (Gure-Kahugu), Piti, and the Nimbia dialect of Gwandara; the Chepang language of Nepal, and the Maldivian language (Dhivehi) of the people of the Maldives and Minicoy Island in India are known to use duodecimal numerals. \n\nGermanic languages have special words for 11 and 12, such as \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" in English. However, they come from Proto-Germanic *\"ainlif\" and *\"twalif\" (meaning, respectively \"one left\" and \"two left\"), suggesting a decimal rather than duodecimal origin.\n\nHistorically, units of time in many civilizations are duodecimal. There are twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve months in a year, and the Babylonians had twelve hours in a day (although at some point this was changed to 24). Traditional Chinese calendars, clocks, and compasses are based on the twelve Earthly Branches. There are 12 inches in an imperial foot, 12 troy ounces in a troy pound, 12 old British pence in a shilling, 24 (12×2) hours in a day, and many other items counted by the dozen, gross (144, square of 12) or great gross (1728, cube of 12). The Romans used a fraction system based on 12, including the uncia which became both the English words \"ounce\" and \"inch\". Pre-decimalisation, Ireland and the United Kingdom used a mixed duodecimal-vigesimal currency system (12 pence = 1 shilling, 20 shillings or 240 pence to the pound sterling or Irish pound), and Charlemagne established a monetary system that also had a mixed base of twelve and twenty, the remnants of which persist in many places.\n\n! colspan=\"6\"Table of units from a base of 12\n!

It is possible to count to 12 with the thumb acting as a pointer, touching each finger bone in turn. A traditional finger counting system still in use in many regions of Asia works in this way, and could help to explain the occurrence of numeral systems based on 12 and 60 besides those based on 10, 20 and 5. In this system, the one (usually right) hand counts repeatedly to 12, displaying the number of iterations on the other (usually left), until five dozens, i. e. the 60, are full.\n\nIn a duodecimal place system, twelve is written as 10, but there are numerous proposals for how to write ten and eleven. \n\nTo allow entry on typewriters, letters such as A and B (as in hexadecimal), T and E (initials of Ten and Eleven), X and E (X from the Roman numeral for ten), or X and Z are used. Some employ Greek letters such as δ (standing for Greek δέκα 'ten') and ε (for Greek ένδεκα 'eleven'), or τ and ε. Frank Emerson Andrews, an early American advocate for duodecimal, suggested and used in his book \"New Numbers\" an X and ℰ (script E, ).\n\nEdna Kramer in her 1951 book \"The Main Stream of Mathematics\" used a six-pointed asterisk (sextile) ⚹ and a hash (or octothorpe) #. The symbols were chosen because they are available in typewriters; they also are on push-button telephones. This notation was used in publications of the Dozenal Society of America (DSA) in the period 1974–2008.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2015, the DSA used and , the symbols devised by William Addison Dwiggins. \nThe Dozenal Society of Great Britain (DSGB) proposed symbols and . This notation, derived from Arabic digits by 180° rotation, was introduced by Sir Isaac Pitman. \n\nIn March 2013, a proposal was submitted to include the digit forms for ten and eleven propagated by the Dozenal Societies in the Unicode Standard. Of these, the British/Pitman forms were accepted for encoding as characters at code points and . They were included in the Unicode 8.0 release in June 2015 and are available in LaTeX as codice_1 and codice_2 respectively, but here and are used instead.\n\nAfter the Pitman digits were added to Unicode, the DSA took a vote and then began publishing content using the Pitman digits instead. They still use the letters X and E in ASCII text.\n\nOther proposals are more creative or aesthetic; for example, many do not use any Arabic numerals, under the principle of \"separate identity\".\n\nThere are also varying proposals of how to distinguish a duodecimal number from a decimal one. They include italicizing duodecimal numbers \"\"54\" = 64\", adding a \"Humphrey point\" (a semicolon \";\" instead of a decimal point \".\") to duodecimal numbers \"54;6 = 64.5\", or some combination of the two. Others use subscript or affixed labels to indicate the base, allowing for more than decimal and duodecimal to be represented (for single letters 'z' from \"dozenal\" is used as 'd' would mean decimal) such as \"54 = 64,\" \"54 = 64\" or \"doz 54 = dec 64.\"\n\nThe Dozenal Society of America suggested the pronunciation of ten and eleven as \"dek\" and \"el\". For the names of powers of twelve there are two prominent systems.\n\nIn this system,the prefix \"e\"- is added for fractions.\n\n!

Emerson noted that, due to the prevalence of factors of twelve in many traditional units of weight and measure, many of the computational advantages claimed for the metric system could be realized \"either\" by the adoption of ten-based weights and measure \"or\" by the adoption of the duodecimal number system.\nBoth the Dozenal Society of America and the Dozenal Society of Great Britain promote widespread adoption of the base-twelve system. They use the word \"dozenal\" instead of \"duodecimal\" to avoid the more overtly base-ten terminology. The etymology of \"dozenal\" is itself also an expression based on base-ten terminology since \"dozen\" is a direct derivation of the French word \"douzaine\" which is a derivative of the French word for twelve, \"douze\" which is related to the old French word \"doze\" from Latin \"duodecim\". \n\nSince at least as far back as 1945 some members of the Dozenal Society of America and Dozenal Society of Great Britain have suggested that a more apt word would be \"uncial\". Uncial is a derivation of the Latin word \"uncia\", meaning \"one-twelfth\", and also the base-twelve analogue of the Latin word \"decima\", meaning \"one-tenth\".\n\nMathematician and mental calculator Alexander Craig Aitken was an outspoken advocate of duodecimal:\n\nIn Lee Carroll's \"Kryon: Alchemy of the Human Spirit\", a chapter is dedicated to the advantages of the duodecimal system. The duodecimal system is supposedly suggested by Kryon (a fictional entity believed in by New Age circles) for all-round use, aiming at better and more natural representation of nature of the Universe through mathematics. An individual article \"Mathematica\" by James D. Watt (included in the above publication) exposes a few of the unusual symmetry connections between the duodecimal system and the golden ratio, as well as provides numerous number symmetry-based arguments for the universal nature of the base-12 number system.\n\nIn \"Little Twelvetoes\", American television series \"Schoolhouse Rock!\" portrayed an alien child using base-twelve arithmetic, using \"dek\", \"el\" and \"doh\" as names for ten, eleven and twelve, and Andrews' script-X and script-E for the digit symbols.\n\nSystems of measurement proposed by dozenalists include:\nBULLET::::- Tom Pendlebury's TGM system\nBULLET::::- Takashi Suga's Universal Unit System\n\nThe number 12 has six factors, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, of which 2 and 3 are prime. The decimal system has only four factors, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10, of which 2 and 5 are prime. Vigesimal (base 20) adds two factors to those of ten, namely 4 and 20, but no additional prime factor. Although twenty has 6 factors, 2 of them prime, similarly to twelve, it is also a much larger base, and so the digit set and the multiplication table are much larger. Binary has only two factors, 1 and 2, the latter being prime. Hexadecimal (base 16) has five factors, adding 4, 8 and 16 to those of 2, but no additional prime. Trigesimal (base 30) is the smallest system that has three different prime factors (all of the three smallest primes: 2, 3 and 5) and it has eight factors in total (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30). Sexagesimal—which the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians among others actually used—adds the four convenient factors 4, 12, 20, and 60 to this but no new prime factors. The smallest system that has four different prime factors is base 210 and the pattern follows the primorials. In all base systems, there are similarities to the representation of multiples of numbers which are one less than the base.\n\n+ Duodecimal multiplication table\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"1\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"2\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"3\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"4\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"5\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"6\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"7\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"8\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"9\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!style=\"text-align: right;\"\n!1\n 123456789\n!2\n246810121416181\n!3\n3691013161920232629\n!4\n48101418202428303438\n!5\n513182126234394247\n!6\n610162026303640465056\n!7\n7121924236414853565\n!8\n814202834404854606874\n!9\n916233039465360697683\n!\n1826344250568768492\n!\n129384756657483921\n\nTo convert numbers between bases, one can use the general conversion algorithm (see the relevant section under positional notation). Alternatively, one can use digit-conversion tables. The ones provided below can be used to convert any duodecimal number between 0;01 and ,; to decimal, or any decimal number between 0.01 and 999,999.99 to duodecimal. To use them, the given number must first be decomposed into a sum of numbers with only one significant digit each. For example:\n\nThis decomposition works the same no matter what base the number is expressed in. Just isolate each non-zero digit, padding them with as many zeros as necessary to preserve their respective place values. If the digits in the given number include zeroes (for example, 102,304.05), these are, of course, left out in the digit decomposition (102,304.05 = 100,000 + 2,000 + 300 + 4 + 0.05). Then the digit conversion tables can be used to obtain the equivalent value in the target base for each digit. If the given number is in duodecimal and the target base is decimal, we get:\n\nNow, because the summands are already converted to base ten, the usual decimal arithmetic is used to perform the addition and recompose the number, arriving at the conversion result:\n\nThat is, 123,456;78 equals 296,130.63 ≈ 296,130.64\n\nIf the given number is in decimal and the target base is duodecimal, the method is basically same. Using the digit conversion tables:\n\nHowever, in order to do this sum and recompose the number, now the addition tables for the duodecimal system have to be used, instead of the addition tables for decimal most people are already familiar with, because the summands are now in base twelve and so the arithmetic with them has to be in duodecimal as well. In decimal, 6 + 6 equals 12, but in duodecimal it equals 10; so, if using decimal arithmetic with duodecimal numbers one would arrive at an incorrect result. Doing the arithmetic properly in duodecimal, one gets the result:\n\nThat is, 123,456.78 equals 5,540;9... ≈ 5,540;94\n\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Decimal\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Decimal\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\"  \"Duod.\"\n! \"Dec.\"\n\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duod.\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" \"Dec.\"\n! \"Duodecimal\"\n\nThis section is about the divisibility rules in duodecimal.\n\nBULLET::::- 1\nAny integer is divisible by 1.\n\nBULLET::::- 2\nIf a number is divisible by 2 then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or .\n\nBULLET::::- 3\nIf a number is divisible by 3 then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 3, 6 or 9.\n\nBULLET::::- 4\nIf a number is divisible by 4 then the unit digit of that number will be 0, 4 or 8.\n\nBULLET::::- 5\nTo test for divisibility by 5, double the units digit and subtract the result from the number formed by the rest of the digits.

Examples in duodecimal\n! Decimal equivalent\n\nAs explained in recurring decimals, whenever an irreducible fraction is written in radix point notation in any base, the fraction can be expressed exactly (terminates) if and only if all the prime factors of its denominator are also prime factors of the base. Thus, in base-ten (= 2×5) system, fractions whose denominators are made up solely of multiples of 2 and 5 terminate:  = ,  =  and  =  can be expressed exactly as 0.125, 0.05 and 0.002 respectively. and , however, recur (0.333... and 0.142857142857...). In the duodecimal (= 2×2×3) system, is exact; and recur because they include 5 as a factor; is exact; and recurs, just as it does in decimal.\n\nThe number of denominators which give terminating fractions within a given number of digits, say \"n\", in a base \"b\" is the number of factors (divisors) of \"b\", the \"n\"th power of the base \"b\" (although this includes the divisor 1, which does not produce fractions when used as the denominator). The number of factors of \"b\" is given using its prime factorization.\n\nFor decimal, 10 = 2 * 5. The number of divisors is found by adding one to each exponent of each prime and multiplying the resulting quantities together.\nFactors of 10 = (\"n\"+1)(\"n\"+1) = (\"n\"+1).\n\nFor example, the number 8 is a factor of 10 (1000), so 1/8 and other fractions with a denominator of 8 cannot require more than 3 fractional decimal digits to terminate. 5/8 = 0.625\n\nFor duodecimal, 12 = 2 * 3. This has (2\"n\"+1)(\"n\"+1) divisors. The sample denominator of 8 is a factor of a gross (12 = 144), so eighths cannot need more than two duodecimal fractional places to terminate. 5/8 = 0;76\n\nBecause both ten and twelve have two unique prime factors, the number of divisors of \"b\" for \"b\" = 10 or 12 grows quadratically with the exponent \"n\" (in other words, of the order of \"n\").\n\nThe Dozenal Society of America argues that factors of 3 are more commonly encountered in real-life division problems than factors of 5. Thus, in practical applications, the nuisance of repeating decimals is encountered less often when duodecimal notation is used. Advocates of duodecimal systems argue that this is particularly true of financial calculations, in which the twelve months of the year often enter into calculations.\n\nHowever, when recurring fractions \"do\" occur in duodecimal notation, they are less likely to have a very short period than in decimal notation, because 12 (twelve) is between two prime numbers, 11 (eleven) and 13 (thirteen), whereas ten is adjacent to the composite number 9. Nonetheless, having a shorter or longer period doesn't help the main inconvenience that one does not get a finite representation for such fractions in the given base (so rounding, which introduces inexactitude, is necessary to handle them in calculations), and overall one is more likely to have to deal with infinite recurring digits when fractions are expressed in decimal than in duodecimal, because one out of every three consecutive numbers contains the prime factor 3 in its factorization, whereas only one out of every five contains the prime factor 5. All other prime factors, except 2, are not shared by either ten or twelve, so they do not\ninfluence the relative likeliness of encountering recurring digits (any irreducible fraction that contains any of these other factors in its denominator will recur in either base). Also, the prime factor 2 appears twice in the factorization of twelve, whereas only once in the factorization of ten; which means that most fractions whose denominators are powers of two will have a shorter, more convenient terminating representation in duodecimal than in decimal representation (e.g. 1/(2) = 0.25 = 0.3 ; 1/(2) = 0.125 = 0.16 ; 1/(2) = 0.0625 = 0.09 ; 1/(2) = 0.03125 = 0.046 ; etc.).\n\nValues in bold indicate that value is exact.\n\n!

His parents were Robert Agnew and Agnes Noble. Agnew grew up as a Christian. He was surrounded by a family of doctors and had always known he was going to become a physician. As a young boy, he had a sharp sense of humor and was very intelligent. \n\nHe graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1838. He returned to Nobleville to help his father in his clinic. He worked there for two years. His father was an asthmatic and moved to Maryland in 1840 because the climate was more suited to his condition. Agnew moved with him. On November 21, 1841, he married Margaret Irwin. In 1852, he bought and revived the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. He held responsibility for ten years until 1862. During the American Civil War he was consulting surgeon in the Mower Army Hospital, near Philadelphia, and acquired a considerable reputation for his operations in cases of gunshot wounds. On December 21, 1863, he became the Demonstrator of Anatomy and Assistant Lecturer on Clinical Surgery at The University of Pennsylvania. Later, he was requested to assist the Professor of Surgery in the Conduct of the surgical clinics. In the year 1865, he gave summer instruction courses. For the next seven years, he worked for the University as Demonstrator of Anatomy. A large portion of his success was due to his wife's energy, intelligence, and determination. She gave him an impetus to try harder and not be satisfied with his first try.\n\nOn July 2, 1881, President James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau. He held the position of chief consulting surgeon. When a committee came to give him his money for helping, Agnew said, \"Gentlemen, I present no bill for my attendance to President Garfield. I gave my services freely and gratuitously\". He was never optimistic about the President's case and was not fooled by fallacious beliefs. This procedure helped create Agnew's reputation.\n\n\"The Agnew Clinic\" is an 1889 painting by Thomas Eakins which depicts Agnew conducting a mastectomy operation before a gallery of students and doctors.\n\nDavid Agnew wrote \"The Principles and Practice of Surgery\". It was a three-volume set that he published from 1878–1883. He also helped found the Irwin & Agnew Iron Foundry in 1846.\n\nAgnew caught a severe attack of epidemic influenza in 1890. He never fully recovered. Following this, he had an attack of broncho-vesicular catarrh. On March 9, 1892, he was put to bed for a series of medical problems. After a few days his condition began to improve, but suddenly, on March 12 it became much worse. On March 20, he fell into a comatose condition. Agnew stayed like this until he died at 3:20 p.m. on March 22, 1892. He is now buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Who Was Who in America: Historical Volume, 1607–1896.\" Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1963.\n\nBULLET::::- Agnew, D.

{"id": "8402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8402", "title": "Diving (sport)", "text": "Diving (sport)\n\nDiving is the sport of jumping or falling into water from a platform or springboard, usually while performing acrobatics. Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the Olympic Games. In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.\n\nDiving is one of the most popular Olympic sports with spectators. Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as gymnasts and dancers, including strength, flexibility, kinaesthetic judgment and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. Dmitri Sautin holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.\n\nAlthough diving has been a popular pastime across the world since ancient times, the first modern diving competitions were held in England in the 1880s. The exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races. The 1904 book \"Swimming\" by Ralph Thomas notes English reports of plunging records dating back to at least 1865. The 1877 edition to \"British Rural Sports\" by John Henry Walsh makes note of a \"Mr. Young\" plunging in 1870, and also states that 25 years prior, a swimmer named Drake could cover .\n\nThe English Amateur Swimming Association (at the time called the Swimming Association of Great Britain) first started a \"plunging championship\" in 1883. The Plunging Championship was discontinued in 1937.\n\nDiving into a body of water had also been a method used by gymnasts in Germany and Sweden since the early 19th century. The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height. This tradition evolved into 'fancy diving', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as 'Plain diving'.\n\nIn England, the practice of high diving – diving from a great height – gained popularity; the first diving stages were erected at the Highgate Ponds at a height of in 1893 and the first world championship event, the National Graceful Diving Competition, was held there by the Royal Life Saving Society in 1895. The event consisted of standing and running dives from either .\n\nIt was at this event that the Swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the Amateur Diving Association in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.\n\nPlain diving was first introduced into the Olympics at the 1904 event. The 1908 Olympics in London added 'fancy diving' and introduced elastic boards rather than fixed platforms. Women were first allowed to participate in the diving events for the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.\n\nIn the 1928 Olympics, 'plain' and 'fancy' diving was amalgamated into one event – 'Highboard Diving'. The diving event was first held indoors in the Empire Pool for the 1934 British Empire Games and 1948 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nMost diving competitions consist of three disciplines: 1 m and 3 m springboards, and the platform. Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group. In platform events, competitors are allowed to perform their dives on either the five, seven and a half (generally just called seven), nine, or ten meter towers. In major diving meets, including the Olympic Games and the World Championships, platform diving is from the 10 meter height.\nDivers have to perform a set number of dives according to established requirements, including somersaults and twists. Divers are judged on whether and how well they completed all aspects of the dive, the conformance of their body to the requirements of the dive, and the amount of splash created by their entry to the water. A possible score out of ten is broken down into three points for the takeoff (meaning the hurdle), three for the flight (the actual dive), and three for the entry (how the diver hits the water), with one more available to give the judges flexibility.\n\nThe raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted. The diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.\n\nSynchronized diving was adopted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form a team and perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be possible to dive opposites, also known as a pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.\n\nThere are rules governing the scoring of a dive. Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry. The primary factors affecting the scoring are:\n\nBULLET::::- if a hand-stand is required, the length of time and quality of the hold\nBULLET::::- the height of the diver at the apex of the dive, with extra height resulting in a higher score\nBULLET::::- the distance of the diver from the diving apparatus throughout the dive (a diver must not be dangerously close, should not be too far away, but should ideally be within of the platform)\nBULLET::::- the properly defined body position of the diver according to the dive being performed, including pointed toes and feet touching at all times\nBULLET::::- the proper amounts of rotation and revolution upon completion of the dive and entry into the water\nBULLET::::- angle of entry – a diver should enter the water straight, without any angle.\nBULLET::::- amount of splash – many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.\n\nEach dive is assigned a \"degree of difficulty\" (DD), which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.\n\nTo reduce the subjectivity of scoring in major meets, panels of five or seven judges are assembled; major international events such as the Olympics use seven-judge panels. For a five-judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD. For seven-judge panels, as of the 2012 London Olympics, the two highest scores and two lowest are discarded, leaving three to be summed and multiplied by the DD. (Prior to the London Olympics, the highest and lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining five scores were multiplied by , to allow for comparison to five-judge panels.) The canceling of scores is used to make it difficult for a single judge to manipulate scores.\n\nThere is a general misconception about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.\n\nIn synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation. The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them. The 2012 London Olympics saw the first use of eleven judges.\n\nThe score is computed similarly to the scores from other diving events, but has been modified starting with the 2012 London Olympics for the use of the larger judging panels. Each group of judges will have the highest and lowest scores dropped, leaving the middle score for each diver's execution and the three middle scores for synchronization. The total is then weighted by and multiplied by the DD. The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.\n\nThe synchronisation scores are based on:\nBULLET::::- time of take-off\nBULLET::::- height attained\nBULLET::::- synchronisation of rotations and twists\nBULLET::::- time of entry to the water\nBULLET::::- forward travel from the board\n\nThe judges may also disqualify the diver for certain violations during the dive, including:\nBULLET::::- receiving a score of 0 on all dives performed in the event\nBULLET::::- improper equipment usage (e.g., female divers not using hair ties)\n\nTo win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.\n\nIn competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).\n\nIn the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors. The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.\n\nThere are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.\n\nGenerally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a balk (when the diver stops mid-hurdle) and the change of dive will not be permitted.\n\nUnder FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).\n\nIt is the diver's responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.\n\nThe global governing body of diving is FINA, which also governs swimming, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming. Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.\n\nThis is frequently a source of political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand the concerns of the diving community. Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.\n\nThere are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful. For example, in the UK the Great Britain Diving Federation was formed in 1992 with the intention of taking over the governance of Diving from the ASA (Amateur Swimming Association). Although it initially received widespread support from the diving community, the FINA requirement that international competitors had to be registered with their National Governing Body was a major factor in the abandonment of this ambition a few years later.\n\nSince FINA refused to rescind recognition of the ASA as the British governing body for all aquatic sports including diving, this meant that the elite divers had to belong to ASA-affiliated clubs to be eligible for selection to international competition.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving is almost always part of the school's swim team. Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and Club Diving. The NCAA will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.\n\nDespite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.\n\nThe majority of accidents that are classified as 'diving-related' are incidents caused by individuals jumping from structures such as bridges or piers into water of inadequate depth. Many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water. Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a lifeguard is not on duty.\n\nAfter an incident in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a \"suicide dive\" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.\nThe NSPI had specified a minimum depth of 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards. The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner. But the courts held that the pool \"was close enough\" to the standards to hold NSPI liable. The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6 million ($8 million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff. The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.\n\nIn competitive diving, FINA takes regulatory steps to ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport. For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.\n\nBULLET::::- Group D (11 & under): 5 m\nBULLET::::- Group C (12/13 year): 5 m & 7.5 m\nBULLET::::- Group B (14/15 year): 5 m, 7.5 m & 10 m\nBULLET::::- Group A (16/18 year): 5 m, 7.5 m & 10 m\n\nGroup D divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower. In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving. Group D tower was introduced to counteract the phenomenon of coaches pushing young divers to compete in higher age categories, thus putting them at even greater risk.\n\nHowever, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms. Usually this occurs when advanced Group C divers wish to compete on the 10 m.\n\nPoints on pool depths in connection with safety:\n\nBULLET::::- most competition pools are 5m deep for 10 m platform and 4m deep for 5m platform or 3m springboard. These are currently the FINA recommended minimum depths. Some are deeper, e.g. 6m for the diving pit at Sheffield, England.\nBULLET::::- diving from 10 m and maintaining a downward streamlined position results in gliding to a stop at about 4.5 – 5m.\nBULLET::::- high standard competition divers rarely go more than about 2.5m below the surface, as they roll in the direction of the dive's rotation. This is a technique to produce a clean entry.\nBULLET::::- attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.\nBULLET::::- hitting the water flat from 10 m brings the diver to rest in about 1 ft. The extreme deceleration causes severe bruising both internal and external, strains to connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor hemorrhage to lungs and other tissue. This is very painful and distressing, but not life-threatening.\n\nThere are six \"groups\" into which dives are classified: \"Forward, Back, Inward, Reverse, Twist,\" and \"Armstand\". The latter applies only to Platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both Springboard and Platform.\n\nBULLET::::- in the Forward Group (Group 1), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates forward\nBULLET::::- in the Back Group (2), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates backward\nBULLET::::- in the Reverse Group (3), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates backward\nBULLET::::- in the Inward Group (4), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates forward\nBULLET::::- any dive incorporating an axial twisting movement is in the Twist group (5).\nBULLET::::- any dive commencing from a handstand is in the Armstand group (6). (Only on platform)\nDuring the flight of the dive, one of four positions is assumed:\nBULLET::::- straight – with no bend at the knees or hips (the hardest of the four)\nBULLET::::- pike – with knees straight but a tight bend at the hips (the median in difficulty of the four.) The open pike is a variant where the arms are reached to the side, and the legs are brought straight out with a bend in the hips.\nBULLET::::- tuck – body folded up in a tight ball, hands holding the shins and toes pointed (the easiest of the four.)\nBULLET::::- free – indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions. In the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist, and points will not be deducted for doing so.\n\nThese positions are referred to by the letters A, B, C and D respectively.\n\nAdditionally, some dives can be started in a flying position. The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.\n\nDifficulty is rated according to the Degree of Difficulty of the dives. Some divers may find pike easier in a flip than tuck, and most find straight the easiest in a front/back dive, although it is still rated the most difficult because of the risk of overrotation.\n\nAn armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver.\n\nIn competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three- or four-digit numbers. The letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.\n\nThe first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.\n\nFor groups 1 to 4, the number consists of three digits and a letter of the alphabet. The third digit represents the number of half-somersaults. The second digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 representing a normal somersault, and 1 signifying a \"flying\" variation of the basic movement (i.e. the first half somersault is performed in the straight position, and then the pike or tuck shape is assumed). No flying dive has been competed at a high level competition for many years.\n\nFor example:\nBULLET::::- 101A – forward Dive Straight\nBULLET::::- 203C – back one-and-a-half somersaults, tuck\nBULLET::::- 305C – reverse two-and-a-half somersaults, tuck\nBULLET::::- 113B – flying forward one-and-a-half somersaults, pike\n\nFor Group 5, the dive number has 4 digits. The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive. The second digit indicates the group (1–4) of the underlying movement; the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth indicates the number of half-twists.\n\nFor example:\nBULLET::::- 5211A – back dive, half twist, straight position.\nBULLET::::- 5337D – reverse one and a half somersaults with three and a half twists, in the Free position.\n\nFor Group 6 – Armstand – the dive number has either three or four digits: Three digits for dives without twist and four for dives with twists.\n\nIn non-twisting armstand dives, the second digit indicates the direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.\n\nFor example:\nBULLET::::- 600A – armstand dive straight\nBULLET::::- 612B – armstand forward somersault pike\nBULLET::::- 624C – armstand back double somersault tuck\n\nFor twisting Armstand dives, the dive number again has 4 digits, but rather than beginning with the number 5, the number 6 remains as the first digit, indicating that the \"twister\" will be performed from an Armstand. The second digit indicates the direction of rotation – as above, the third is the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth is the number of half-twists:\n\ne.g. 6243D – armstand back double-somersault with one and a half twists in the free position\n\nAll of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult/complex a dive is. The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score. Before a diver competes they must decide on a \"list\" this is a number of optional dives and compulsory dives. The optionals come with a DD limit. this means that a diver must select X number of dives and the combined DD limit must be no more than the limit set by the competition/organisation etc.\n\nUntil the mid-1990s the tariff was decided by the FINA diving committee, and divers could only select from the range of dives in the published tariff table. Since then, the tariff is calculated by a formula based on various factors such as the number of twist and somersaults, the height, the group etc., and divers are free to submit new combinations. This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.\n\nAt the moment of take-off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution. One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.\n\nThe speed of rotation – and therefore the total amount of rotation – may be varied from moment to moment by changing the shape of the body, in accordance with the law of conservation of angular momentum.\n\nThe center of mass of the diver follows a parabolic path in free-fall under the influence of gravity (ignoring the effects of air resistance, which are negligible at the speeds involved).\n\nSince the parabola is symmetrical, the travel away from the board as the diver passes it is twice the amount of the forward travel at the peak of the flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.\n\nThe greatest possible height that can be achieved is desirable for several reasons:\n\nBULLET::::- the height attained is itself one of the factors that the judges will reward.\nBULLET::::- a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.\nBULLET::::- for any given clearance when passing the board, the forward travel distance to the entry point will be less for a higher trajectory.\n\nThe magnitude of angular momentum remains constant throughout the dive, but since\n\nand the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius, the speed of rotation may be increased by moving the body into a compact shape, and reduced by opening out into a straight position.\n\nSince the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform. Dives in the straight position are hardest, since there is almost no scope for altering the speed, so the angular momentum must be created at take-off with a very high degree of accuracy. (A small amount of control is available by moving the position of the arms and by a slight hollowing of the back).\n\nThe opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down. The vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface. A small amount of additional tuning is available by 'entry save' techniques, whereby underwater movements of the upper body and arms against the viscosity of the water affect the position of the legs.\n\nDives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.\n\nThe rules state that twisting 'must not be generated manifestly on take-off'. Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements. The physics of twisting can be explained by looking at the components of the angular momentum vector.\n\nAs the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example. For twisting rotation to exist, it is necessary to tilt the body sideways after takeoff, so that there is now a small component of this horizontal angular momentum vector along the body's long axis. The tilt can be seen in the photo.\n\nThe tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist. When one arm is moved up and the other is moved down (like turning a big steering wheel), the body reacts by tilting to the side, which then begins the twisting rotation. At the completion of the required number of twist rotations, the arm motion is reversed (the steering wheel is turned back), which removes the body's tilt and stops the twisting rotation.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the moving arms have precession torque on them which set the body into twisting rotation. Moving the arms back produces opposite torque which stops the twisting rotation.\n\nThe rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry. Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water. Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For back entries, one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called \"Pike save\". Another is to use \"knee save\" movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.\n\nThe arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of 3m springboard, and extended forwards in line for \"head-first\" dives, which are much more common competitively. It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades. Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface. This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called \"rip entry\").\n\nOnce a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position. Apart from aesthetic considerations, it is important from a safety point of view that divers reinforce the habit of rolling in the direction of rotation, especially for forward and inward entries. Back injuries such as hyperextension are caused by attempting to re-surface in the opposite direction. Diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries.\n\nIn Canada, elite competitive diving is regulated by DPC (Diving Plongeon Canada), although the individual provinces also have organizational bodies. The main competitive season runs from February to July, although some competitions may be held in January or December, and many divers (particularly international level athletes) will train and compete year round.\n\nMost provincial level competitions consist of events for 6 age groups (Groups A, B, C, D, E, and Open) for both genders on each of the three board levels. These age groups roughly correspond to those standardized by FINA, with the addition of a youngest age group for divers 9 and younger, Group E, which does not compete nationally and does not have a tower event (although divers of this age may choose to compete in Group D). The age group Open is so called because divers of any age, including those over 18, may compete in these events, so long as their dives meet a minimum standard of difficulty.\n\nAlthough Canada is internationally a fairly strong country in diving, the vast majority of Canadian high schools and universities do not have diving teams, and many Canadian divers accept athletic scholarships from American colleges.\n\nAdult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving. Typically, masters are either adults who never practiced the sport as children or teenagers, or former elite athletes who have retired but still seek a way to be involved in the sport. Many diving clubs have masters teams in addition to their primary competitive ones, and while some masters dive only for fun and fitness, there are also masters competitions, which range from the local to world championship level.\n\nDivers can qualify to compete at the age group national championships, or junior national championships, in their age groups as assigned by FINA up to the age of 18. This competition is held annually in July. Qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions in the season, although athletes who place very highly at a national championship will be automatically qualified to compete at the next. Divers must qualify at two different competitions, at least one of which must be a level 1 competition, i.e. a competition with fairly strict judging patterns. Such competitions include the Polar Bear Invitational in Winnipeg, the Sting in Victoria, and the Alberta Provincial Championships in Edmonton or Calgary. The qualifying scores are determined by DPC according to the results of the preceding year's national competition, and typically do not have much variation from year to year.\n\nDivers older than 18, or advanced divers of younger ages, can qualify for the senior national championships, which are held twice each year, once roughly in March and once in June or July. Once again, qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions (in this case, within the 12 months preceding the national championships, and in an Open age group event), or high placements in previous national championships or international competitions. It is no longer the case that divers may use results from age group events to qualify for senior nationals, or results from Open events to qualify for age group nationals.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin.\n\nNational championships take place late in the year, usually during November. The competition is held at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin and consists of four events:\nBULLET::::- Irish Open Age Group Championships\nBULLET::::- Irish Open Senior Diving Championships\nBULLET::::- Novice Competition (8–16 yrs)\nBULLET::::- Novice Masters Competition (>25 yrs)\n\nIn the United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year. National Masters' Championships are held two or three times per year.\n\nIn the United States, summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools. Some pools organize to form intra-pool competitions. These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school-age children. \n\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving (but some schools use three meter springboards.). Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score. High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition. Depending on the state and the number of athletes competing in the state, certain qualifications must be achieved to compete in the state's championship meet. There are often regional championships and district championships which are necessary to compete in before reaching the state meet to narrow the field to only the most competitive athletes. Most state championship meets consist of eleven dives. The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required (voluntary) dives and six optional dives.\n\nIn the United States, pre-college divers interested in learning one and three meter or platform diving should consider a club sanctioned by either USA Diving or AAU Diving. In USA Diving, Future Champions is the entry level or novice diver category with 8 levels of competition. From Future Champions, divers graduate to \"Junior Olympic\", or JO. JO divers compete in age groups at inter-club competitions, at invitationals, and if qualified, at regional, zone and national competitions. Divers over the age of 19 years of age cannot compete in these events as a JO diver.\n\nUSA Diving sanctions the Winter Nationals championship with one, three meter, and platform events. In the summer USA Diving sanctions the Summer Nationals including all three events with both Junior and Senior divers. USA Diving is sanctioned by the United States Olympic Committee to select team representatives for international diving competitions including the World Championships and Olympic Games.\n\nAAU Diving sanctions one national event per year in the summer. AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the All-American team.\n\nIn the United States scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving. Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score. College divers interested in tower diving may compete in the NCAA separate from swim team events. NCAA Divisions II and III do not usually compete platform; if a diver wishes to compete platform in college, he or she must attend a Division I school.\n\nEach division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition. Division II schools compete with 10 dives in competition whereas Division III schools compete with 11. Division I schools only compete with 6 dives in competition. These 6 dives consist of either 5 optionals and 1 voluntary, or 6 optionals. If the meet is a 5 optional meet, then the divers will perform 1 optional from each category (Front, Back, Inward, Reverse, and Twister) and then 1 voluntary from the category of their choice. The voluntary in this type of meet is always worth a DD (Degree of Difficulty) of 2.0 even if the real DD is worth more or less on a DD sheet. In a 6 optional meet, the divers will yet again perform one dive from each category, but this time they will perform a 6th optional from the category of their choosing, which is worth its actual DD from the DD sheet.\n\nThe highest level of collegiate competition is the NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championship. Events at the championship include 1 meter springboard, 3 meter springboard, and platform, as well as various swimming individual and relay events. The points scored by swimmers and divers are combined to determine a team swimming & diving champion. To qualify for a diving event at the NCAA championships, a competitor must first finish in the top three at one of five zone championships, which are held after the various conference championship meets. A diver who scores at least 310 points on the 3 meter springboard and 300 points on the 1 meter springboard in a 6 optional meet can participate in the particular zone championship corresponding to the geographic region in which his or her school lies.\n\nA number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills. These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age-group or club diving experience.\n\nThe NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions. The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.\n\nDivers who continue diving past their college years can compete in Masters' Diving programs. Masters' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.\n\nMasters' Diving events are normally conducted in age-groups separated by five or ten years, and attract competitors of a wide range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters' Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organized competition.\n\nDiving is also popular as a non-competitive activity. Such diving usually emphasizes the airborne experience, and the height of the dive, but does not emphasize what goes on once the diver enters the water. The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training. Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater swimming.\n\nSuch non-competitive diving can occur indoors and outdoors. Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water. However, man-made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations. Outdoor diving requires knowledge of the water depth and currents as conditions can be dangerous.\nOn occasion, the diver will inadvertently belly flop, entering the water horizontally or nearly so. The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.\n\nA recently developing section of the sport is \"High Diving\" (e.g. see 2013 World Aquatics Championships), conducted in open air locations, usually from improvised platforms up to high (as compared with as used in Olympic and World Championship events). Entry to the water is invariably feet-first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head-first entry from that height. The final half-somersault is almost always performed backwards, enabling the diver to spot the entry point and control their rotation.\n\nBULLET::::- Acrobatics\nBULLET::::- Aquatic timing system\nBULLET::::- Cannonball (diving)\nBULLET::::- Diving at the Summer Olympics\nBULLET::::- La Quebrada Cliff Divers\nBULLET::::- List of Olympic medalists in diving\nBULLET::::- Scuba diving\nBULLET::::- Swimming\nBULLET::::- Shallow Diving\nBULLET::::- Waterproof digital camera\nBULLET::::- List of 10 meter diving platforms in the United States\n\nBULLET::::- FINA\nBULLET::::- USA Diving\nBULLET::::- AAU Diving\nBULLET::::- NCAA\nBULLET::::- USA Masters' Diving.\nBULLET::::- FINA table of degree of difficulty (PDF)\nBULLET::::- Diving mentality\n"}
{"id": "8406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8406", "title": "Dative case", "text": "Dative case\n\nThe dative case (abbreviated , or sometimes when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used in some languages to indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action, as in \"Maria Jacobo potum dedit\", Latin for \"Maria gave Jacob a drink\". In this example, the dative marks what would be considered the indirect object of a verb in English.\n\nSometimes the dative has functions unrelated to giving. In Scottish Gaelic and Irish, the term \"dative case\" is used in traditional grammars to refer to the prepositional case-marking of nouns following simple prepositions and the definite article. In Georgian, the dative case also marks the subject of the sentence with some verbs and some tenses. This is called the dative construction.\n\nThe dative was common among early Indo-European languages and has survived to the present in the Balto-Slavic branch and the Germanic branch, among others. It also exists in similar forms in several non-Indo-European languages, such as the Uralic family of languages. In some languages, the dative case has assimilated the functions of other, now extinct cases. In Ancient Greek, the dative has the functions of the Proto-Indo-European locative and instrumental as well as those of the original dative.\n\nUnder the influence of English, which uses the preposition \"to\" for (among other uses) both indirect objects (\"give to\") and directions of movement (\"go to\"), the term \"dative\" has sometimes been used to describe cases that in other languages would more appropriately be called lative.\n\n\"Dative\" comes from Latin \"cāsus datīvus\" (\"case for giving\"), a translation of Greek δοτικὴ πτῶσις, \"dotikē ptôsis\" (\"inflection for giving\"), from its use with the verb \"didónai\" \"to give\". Dionysius Thrax in his Art of Grammar also refers to it as \"epistaltikḗ\" \"for sending (a letter)\", from the verb \"epistéllō\" \"send to\", a word from the same root as epistle.\n\nThe Old English language, which continued in use until after the Norman Conquest of 1066, had a dative case; however, the English case system gradually fell into disuse during the Middle English period, when the accusative and dative of pronouns merged into a single oblique case that was also used with all prepositions. This conflation of case in Middle and Modern English has led most modern grammarians to discard the \"accusative\" and \"dative\" labels as obsolete in reference to English, often using the term \"objective\" for oblique.\n\nThe dative case is rare in modern English usage, but it can be argued that it survives in a few set expressions. One example is the word \"methinks\", with the meaning \"it seems to me\". It survives in this fixed form from Old English (having undergone, however, phonetic changes with the rest of the language), in which it was constructed as \"[it]\" + \"me\" (the dative case of the personal pronoun) + \"thinks\" (i.e., \"seems\", < Old English þyncan, \"to seem\", a verb closely related to the verb þencan, \"to think\", but distinct from it in Old English; later it merged with \"think\" and lost this meaning).\n\nThe modern objective case pronoun whom is derived from the dative case in Old English, specifically the Old English dative pronoun \"hwām\" (as opposed to the modern subjective \"who\", which descends from Old English \"hwā\") – though \"whom\" \"also\" absorbed the functions of the Old English accusative pronoun \"hwone\". It is also cognate to the word \"\"wem\"\" (the dative form of \"\"wer\"\") in German. The OED defines all classical uses of the word \"whom\" in situations where the indirect object \"is not known\" – in effect, indicating the anonymity of the indirect object.\n\nLikewise, some of the object forms of personal pronouns are remnants of Old English datives. For example, \"him\" goes back to the Old English dative \"him\" (accusative was \"hine\"), and \"her\" goes back to the dative \"hire\" (accusative was \"hīe\"). These pronouns are not datives in modern English; they are also used for functions previously indicated by the accusative.\n\nA grammatical \"object\" is an object \"of something\", either an object \"of a preposition\" or an object \"of a verb\". Objects of verbs can be either \"direct\" or \"indirect\", while objects of prepositions are neither direct nor indirect. The indirect object of the verb is expressed between the verb and the direct object of the verb: \"he gave me a book\" or \"he wrote me a poem.\"\n\nAn indirect object can often be \"re-worded\" with a prepositional phrase using \"to\" or \"for\", but it is then no longer an indirect object. For example, \"He gave a book to me\" and \"He wrote a poem for me\" have the same meaning as the examples above, but are now \"adverbial prepositional phrases\". Of course it is not unusual that two \"different grammatical structures\" can describe the \"same situation\"; however referring to these \"prepositional objects\" mistakenly as \"indirect objects\" is a common error.\n\nIn general, the dative (German: \"Dativ\") is used to mark the indirect object of a German sentence. For example:\nBULLET::::- \"Ich schickte dem Mann(e) das Buch.\" (literally: I sent \"to the man\" the book.) – Masculine\nBULLET::::- \"Ich gab der Frau den Stift zurück.\" (literally: I gave \"to the woman\" the pencil back.) – Feminine\nBULLET::::- \"Ich überreiche dem Kind(e) ein Geschenk.\" (literally: I hand \"to the child\" a present.) – Neuter\n\nIn English, the first sentence can be rendered as \"I sent the book \"to the man\"\" and as \"I sent \"the man\" the book\", where the indirect object is identified in English by standing in front of the direct object. The normal word order in German is to put the dative in front of the accusative (as in the example above). However, since the German dative is marked in form, it can also be put \"after\" the accusative: \"Ich schickte das Buch dem Mann(e). The (e)\" after \"Mann\" and \"Kind\" signifies a now largely archaic -e ending for certain nouns in the dative. It survives today almost exclusively in set phrases such as \"zu Hause\" (at home, \"lit.\" to house), \"im Zuge\" (in the course of), and \"am Tage\" (during the day, \"lit.\" at the day), as well as in occasional usage in formal prose, poetry, and song lyrics.\n\nSome masculine nouns (and one neuter noun, \"Herz\" [heart]), referred to as \"weak nouns\" or \"n-nouns\", take an -n or -en in the dative singular and plural. Many are masculine nouns ending in -e in the nominative (such as \"Name\" [name], \"Beamte\" [officer], and \"Junge\" [boy]), although not all such nouns follow this rule. Many also, whether or not they fall into the former category, refer to people, animals, professions, or titles; exceptions to this include the aforementioned \"Herz\" and \"Name\", as well as \"Buchstabe\" (letter), \"Friede\" (peace), \"Obelisk\" (obelisk), \"Planet\" (planet), and others.\n\nCertain German prepositions require the dative: \"aus\" (from), \"außer\" (out of), \"bei\" (at, near), \"entgegen\" (against), \"gegenüber\" (opposite), \"mit\" (with), \"nach\" (after, to), \"seit\" (since), \"von\" (from), and \"zu\" (at, in, to). Some other prepositions (\"an\" [at], \"auf\" [on], \"entlang\" [along], \"hinter\" [behind], \"in\" [in, into], \"neben\" (beside, next to), \"über\" [over, across], \"unter\" [under, below], \"vor\" [in front of], and \"zwischen\" [among, between]) may be used with dative (indicating current location), or accusative (indicating direction toward something). \"Das Buch liegt auf dem Tisch(e)\" (dative: The book is lying on the table), but \"Ich lege das Buch auf den Tisch\" (accusative: I put the book onto the table).\n\nIn addition the four prepositions \"[an]statt\" (in place of), \"trotz\" (in spite of), \"während\" (during), and \"wegen\" (because of) which require the genitive in modern formal language, are most commonly used with the dative in colloquial German. For example, \"because of the weather\" is expressed as \"wegen dem Wetter\" instead of the formally correct \"wegen des Wetters\". Other prepositions requiring the genitive in formal language, are combined with \"von\" (\"of\") in colloquial style, e.g. \"außerhalb vom Garten\" instead of \"außerhalb des Gartens\" (\"outside the garden\").\n\nNote that the concept of an indirect object may be rendered by a prepositional phrase. In this case, the noun's or pronoun's case is determined by the preposition, NOT by its function in the sentence. Consider this sentence:\nBULLET::::- \"Ich sandte das Buch zum Verleger.\" 'I sent the book to the editor.'\nHere, the subject, \"Ich\", is in the nominative case, the direct object, \"das Buch\", is in the accusative case, and \"zum Verleger\" is in the dative case, since \"zu\" always requires the dative (\"zum\" is a contraction of \"zu\" + \"dem\"). However:\nBULLET::::- \"Ich habe das Buch an meinen Freund (\"accusative\") weitergegeben.\" 'I forwarded the book to my friend.' (\"weitergeben\" = lit.: to give further).\nIn this sentence, \"Freund\" is the indirect object, but, because it follows \"an\" (direction), the accusative is required, not the dative.\n\nAll of the articles change in the dative case.\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n\nSome German verbs require the dative for their direct objects. Common examples are \"antworten\" (to answer), \"danken\" (to thank), \"gefallen\" (to please), \"folgen\" (to follow), \"glauben\" (to believe), \"helfen\" (to help), and \"raten\" (to advise). In each case, the direct object of the verb is rendered in the dative. For example:\nBULLET::::- Meine Freunde helfen \"mir\". (My friends help me.)\n\nThese verbs cannot be used in normal passive constructions, because German allows these only for verbs with accusative objects. It is therefore ungrammatical to say: *\"Ich werde geholfen.\" \"I am helped.\" Instead a special construction called \"impersonal passive\" must be used: \"Mir wird geholfen\", literally: \"To me is helped.\" A colloquial (non-standard) and rarely used way to form the passive voice for dative verbs is the following: \"Ich kriege geholfen\", or: \"Ich bekomme geholfen\", literally: \"I get helped\". The use of the verb \"to get\" here reminds us that the dative case has something to do with giving and receiving. In German, help is not something you \"perform on\" somebody, but rather something you \"offer\" them.\n\nThe dative case is also used with reflexive (\"sich\") verbs when specifying what part of the self the verb is being done to:\nBULLET::::- Ich wasche \"mich\". – accusative (I wash myself.)\nBULLET::::- Ich wasche \"mir die Hände\". – dative (I wash my hands, literally \"I wash for myself the hands\")\nCf. the respective \"accord\" in French: \"Les enfants se sont lavés\" (\"the children have washed themselves\") vs. \"Les enfants se sont lavé\" [uninflected] \"les mains\" (\"... their hands\").\n\nGerman can use two datives to make sentences like: \"Sei mir meinem Sohn(e) gnädig!\" \"For my sake, have mercy on my son!\" Literally: \"Be for me to my son merciful.\" The first dative \"mir\" (\"for me\") expresses the speaker's commiseration (much like the \"dativus ethicus\" in Latin, see below). The second dative \"meinem Sohn(e)\" (\"to my son\") names the actual object of the plea. Mercy is to be given \"to\" the son \"for\" or \"on behalf of\" his mother/father.\n\nAdjective endings also change in the dative case. There are three inflection possibilities depending on what precedes the adjective. They most commonly use \"weak inflection\" when preceded by a definite article (the), \"mixed inflection\" after an indefinite article (a/an), and \"strong inflection\" when a quantity is indicated (many green apples).\n! Adj. in dative case\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n! Neuter\n! Plural\n\nThere are several uses for the dative case (\"Dativus\"):\nBULLET::::- \"Dativus finalis\" (dative of purpose), e.g. \"non scholae sed vitae\" – \"[we learn] not for school, but for life\", \"auxilio vocare\" – \"to call for help\", \"venio auxilio\" – \"I'm coming for help\", \"accipio dono\" – \"I receive [this] as a gift\" or \"puellae ornamento est\" – \"[this] is for the girl's decoration\", or \"... for decoration for the girl\" (as \"puellae\" could be either dative or genitive)\nBULLET::::- \"Dativus commŏdi (incommodi)\", which means action for (or against) somebody, e.g., \"Graecis agros colere\" – \"to till fields for Greeks\"; Combination of Dativus commodi and finalis (double dative): \"tibi laetitiae\" \"to you for joy\"\nBULLET::::- \"Dativus possessivus\" (possessive dative) which means possession, e.g. \"angelis alae sunt\" – literally \"to (or for) the angels are wings\", this is typically found with a copula and translated as \"angels have wings\".\nBULLET::::- \"Dativus ethicus\" (ethic dative) indicates that the person in the dative is or should be especially concerned about the action, e.g. \"Quid mihi Celsus agit?\" \"What is Celsus doing for me?\" (expressing the speaker being especially interested in what Celsus is doing for him or her); or \"Cui prodest?\" \"Whose interest does this serve?\" (literally \"To whom does this do good?\")\nBULLET::::- \"Dativus auctoris\", meaning; 'in the eyes of', e.g., 'vir bonus mihi videtur' 'he seems to me to be a good man'.\nBULLET::::- The dative expresses agency with the gerundive when the gerundive is used to convey obligation or necessity, e.g., 'haec nobis agenda sunt,' 'these things must be done by us.'\n\nIn addition to its main function as the \"dativus\", the dative case has other functions in Classical Greek: (The chart below uses the Latin names for the types of dative; the Greek name for the dative is δωτική πτῶσις, like its Latin equivalent, derived from the verb \"to give\"; in Ancient Greek, δίδωμι.)\nBULLET::::- Dativus finalis: The \"dativus finalis\", or the 'dative of purpose', is when the dative is used to denote \"the purpose\" of a certain action. For example:\nBULLET::::- \"I fight for the king\".\nBULLET::::- \"I die for honour\".\nBULLET::::- Dativus commŏdi (incommodi): The \"dativus commodi sive incommodi\", or the 'dative of benefit (or harm)' is the dative that expresses the advantage or disadvantage of something \"for someone\". For example:\nBULLET::::- \"For the benefit of\": \"\" (Sophocles, \"Ajax\" 1366).\nBULLET::::- \"Every man toils for himself\".\nBULLET::::- \"For the harm or disadvantage of\": \"\" (Thucydides 2.12.4).\nBULLET::::- \"This day will be the beginning of great sorrows for the Greeks (i.e., for their disadvantage)\".\nBULLET::::- Dativus possessivus: The \"dativus possessivus\", or the 'dative of possession' is the dative used to denote \"the possessor\" of a certain object or objects. For example:\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Thucycdides 1.86.3).\nBULLET::::- \"For others have a lot of money and ships and horses, but we have good allies (i.e., To others there is a lot of money...)\".\nBULLET::::- Dativus ethicus: The \"dativus ethicus\", or the 'ethic or polite dative,' is when the dative is used to signify that the person or thing spoken of is regarded with interest by someone. This dative is mostly, if not exclusively, used in pronouns. As such, it is also called the \"dative of pronouns.\" For example:\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Demosthenes 18.178).\nBULLET::::- \"Pay close attention to this, I beg you (i.e., please pay..)\".\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Xenophon, \"Cyropaedia\" 18.178).\nBULLET::::- \"Oh, mother, how handsome grandpa is (I've just realized!)\".\nBULLET::::- Dativus auctoris: The \"dativus auctoris\", or the 'dative of agent,' is the dative used to denote \"the doer\" of an action. Note, however, that in Classical Greek, the agent is usually in the genitive after (by, at the hands of). The agent is in the dative most often with the perfect and pluperfect passive, and with the verbal adjective in . For example:\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Isocrates 8.39)\nBULLET::::- \"Many cures have been discovered by doctors.\"\nBULLET::::- Dativus instrumenti: The \"dativus instrumenti\", or the 'dative of instrument,' is when the dative is used to denote an instrument or means of a certain action (or, more accurately, as the instrumental case). For example:\nBULLET::::- \".\" (Homer, \"Odyssey\" 9.407)\nBULLET::::- \"He kills me with a bait (i.e., by means of a bait).\"\nBULLET::::- Dativus modi: The \"dativus modi\", or the 'dative of manner,' is the dative used to describe \"the manner or way\" by which something happened. For example:\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Thucydides 8.84)\nBULLET::::- \"having died of (from) a disease.\"\nBULLET::::- Dativus mensurae: The \"dativus mensurae\", or the 'dative of measurement,' is the dative used to denote \"the measurement of difference\". For example:\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Plato, \"Phaedo\" 101a)\nBULLET::::- \"taller by a head.\"\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Plato, \"Laws\" 729d)\nBULLET::::- \"by far the best.\"\n\nThe articles in the Greek dative are\n+Definite article\n!\n! Masculine\n! Neuter\n! Feminine\n! Singular\ncolspan=\"2\" ΤΩΙ (τῳ)\n! Plural\ncolspan=\"2\" ΤΟΙΣ (τοις)\n\nThe dative case, strictly speaking, no longer exists in Modern Greek, except in fossilized expressions like δόξα τω Θεώ (from the ecclesiastical τῷ Θεῷ δόξα, \"Glory to God\") or εν τάξει (ἑν τάξει, lit. \"in order\", i.e. \"all right\" or \"OK\"). Otherwise, most of the functions of the dative have been subsumed in the accusative.\n\nIn Russian, the dative case is used for indicating the indirect object of an action (that to which something is given, thrown, read, etc.). In the instance where a person is the goal of motion, dative is used instead of accusative to indicate motion toward. This is usually achieved with the preposition \"κ\" + destination in dative case; \"К врачу\", meaning \"to the doctor.\"\n\nDative is also the necessary case taken by certain prepositions when expressing certain ideas. For instance, when the preposition \"по\" is used to mean \"along,\" its object is always in dative case, as in \"По бокам\", meaning \"along the sides.\"\n\nOther Slavic languages apply the dative case (and the other cases) more or less the same way as does Russian; some languages may use the dative in other ways. The following examples are from Polish:\n\nBULLET::::- after certain verbs (dziękować komuś \"to thank someone\", pomóc komuś \"to help someone\", wierzyć komuś \"to believe someone\")\nBULLET::::- in certain expressions (Czy podoba ci się piosenka? \"Do you like the song?\", Jest mi zimno \"I'm cold\", Jest nam smutno \"We're feeling sad\", Będzie wam trudniej... \"It will be more difficult for you guys\"), Śniło jej się, że... \"She dreamt that\"\nBULLET::::- \"dativus commodi\" to indicate action for somebody (Zbuduję temu człowiekowi dom \"I will build a house for this person\")\nBULLET::::- when something is taken away or something occurs to someone (Zdechł im pies \"Their dog died\"; Zabrali mu komputer \"They took away his computer\"; Zepsuł nam się samochód \"Our car broke down\"; Coś mi się przypomniało \"I just remembered something\")\n\nSome other kinds of dative use as found in the Serbo-Croatian language are: \"Dativus finalis\" (Titaniku u pomoć \"to Titanic's rescue\"), \"Dativus commodi/incommodi\" (Operi svojoj majci suđe \"Wash the dishes for your mother\"), \"Dativus possessivus\" (Ovcama je dlaka gusta \"Sheep's hair is thick\"), \"Dativus ethicus\" (Šta mi radi Boni? \"What is Boni doing? (I am especially interested in what it is)\") and Dativus auctoris (Izgleda mi okej \"It seems okay to me\").\n\nUnusual in other Indo-European branches but common among Slavic languages, endings of nouns and adjectives are different based on grammatical function. Other factors are gender and number. In some cases, the ending may not be obvious, even when those three factors (function, gender, number) are considered. For example, in Polish, 'syn' (\"son\") and 'ojciec' (\"father\") are both masculine singular nouns, yet appear as \"syn → synowi and \"ojciec → ojcu in the dative.\n\nBoth Lithuanian and Latvian have a distinct dative case in the system of nominal declensions.\n\nLithuanian nouns preserve Indo-European inflections in the dative case fairly well: (o-stems) vaikas -> sg. vaikui, pl. vaikams; (ā-stems) ranka -> sg. rankai, pl. rankoms; (i-stems) viltis -> sg. vilčiai, pl. viltims; (u-stems) sūnus -> sg. sūnui, pl. sūnums; (consonant stems) vanduo -> sg. vandeniui, pl. vandenims.\n\nAdjectives in the dative case receive pronominal endings (this might be the result of a more recent development): tas geras vaikas -> sg. tam geram vaikui, pl. tiems geriems vaikams.\n\nThe dative case in Latvian underwent further simplifications – the original masculine endings of \"both\" nouns and adjectives have been replaced with pronominal inflections: tas vīrs -> sg. tam vīram, pl. vīriem. Also, the final \"s\" in all Dative forms has been dropped. The only exception is personal pronouns in the plural: mums (to us), jums (to you). Note that in colloquial Lithuanian the final \"s\" in the dative is often omitted, as well: time geriem vaikam.\n\nIn both Latvian and Lithuanian, the main function of the dative case is to render the indirect object in a sentence: (lt) aš duodu vyrui knygą; (lv) es dodu [duodu] vīram grāmatu – \"I am giving a book to the man\".\n\nThe dative case can also be used with gerundives to indicate an action preceding or simultaneous with the main action in a sentence: (lt) jam įėjus, visi atsistojo – \"when he walked in, everybody stood up\", lit. \"to him having walked in, all stood up\"; (lt) jai miegant, visi dirbo – \"while she slept, everybody was working\", lit. \"to her sleeping, all were working\".\n\nIn modern standard Lithuanian, Dative case is not required by prepositions, although in many dialects it is done frequently: (dial.) iki (+D) šiai dienai, (stand.) iki (+G) šios dienos – \"up until this day\".\n\nIn Latvian, the dative case is taken by several prepositions in the singular and all prepositions in the plural (due to peculiar historical changes): sg. bez (+G) tevis \"(without thee)\" ~ pl. bez (+D) jums \"(without you)\"; sg. pa (+A) ceļu \"(along the road)\" ~ pl. pa (+D) ceļiem \"(along the roads)\".\n\nIn modern Eastern Armenian, the dative is attained by adding any article to the genitive:\n\n\"dog\" = շուն\n\nGEN > շան \"(of the dog; dog's)\" with no articles\n\nDAT > շանը or շանն \"(to the dog)\" with definite articles (-ն if preceding a vowel)\n\nDAT > մի շան \"(to a dog)\" with indefinite article\n\nDAT > շանս \"(to my dog)\" with 1st person possessive article\n\nDAT > շանդ \"(to your dog)\" with 2nd person possessive article\n\nThere is a general tendency to view -ին as the standard dative suffix, but only because that is its most productive (and therefore common) form. The suffix -ին as a dative marker is nothing but the standard, most common, genitive suffix -ի accompanied by the definite article -ն. But the dative case encompasses indefinite objects as well, which will not be marked by -ին:\n\nDefinite DAT > Ես գիրքը տվեցի տղային: \"(I gave the book to the boy)\"\n\nIndefinite DAT> Ես գիրքը տվեցի մի տղայի: \"(I gave the book to a boy)\"\n\nThe main function of the dative marking in Armenian is to indicate the receiving end of an action, more commonly the indirect object which in English is preceded by the preposition \"to\". In the use of \"giving\" verbs like \"give, donate, offer, deliver, sell, bring...\" the dative marks the recipient. With communicative verbs like \"tell, say, advise, explain, ask, answer...\" the dative marks the listener. Other verbs whose indirect objects are marked by the dative case in Armenian are \"show, reach, look, approach...\"\n\nEastern Armenian also uses the dative case to mark the time of an event, in the same way English uses the preposition \"at\", as in \"Meet me at nine o' clock.\"\n\nThe dative case is known as the \"fourth case\" (chaturthi-vibhakti) in the usual procedure in the declension of nouns. Its use is mainly for the indirect object.\n\nAs with many other languages, the dative case is used in Hungarian to show the indirect object of a verb. For example, \"Dánielnek adtam ezt a könyvet\" (I gave this book to Dániel). It has two suffixes, \"-nak\" and \"-nek\"; the correct one is selected by vowel harmony. The personal dative pronouns follow the \"-nek\" version: \"nekem\", \"neked\", etc. This case is also used to express \"for\" in certain circumstances, such as \"I bought a gift for Mother\". In possessive constructions the nak/nek endings are also used but this is not the dative form (rather, the attributive or possessive case)\n\nFinnish does not have a separate dative case. However, the allative case can fulfill essentially the same role as dative, beyond its primary meaning of directional movement (that is, going somewhere or approaching someone). For example: \"He lahjoittivat kaikki rahansa köyhille (They donated all their money to the poor.)\n\nIn the Northeast Caucasian languages, such as Tsez, the dative also takes the functions of the lative case in marking the direction of an action. By some linguists, they are still regarded as two separate cases in those languages, although the suffixes are exactly the same for both cases. Other linguists list them separately only for the purpose of separating syntactic cases from locative cases. An example with the ditransitive verb \"show\" (literally: \"make see\") is given below:\n\"kidb-ā\"\"uži-qo-r\"\"kʼetʼu\"\"b-ikʷa-r-xo\"\ngirlboycatIII-see\n\nThe dative/lative is also used to indicate possession, as in the example below, because there is no such verb as \"to have\".\n\"kidbe-qo-r\"\"kʼetʼu\"\"zow-si\"\ngirlcatbe\nAs in the examples above, the dative/lative case usually occurs in combination with another suffix as poss-lative case; this should not be regarded as a separate case, however, as many of the locative cases in Tsez are constructed analytically; hence, they are, in fact, a combination of two case suffixes. See Tsez language#Locative case suffixes for further details.\n\nVerbs of perception or emotion (like \"see\", \"know\", \"love\", \"want\") also require the logical subject to stand in the dative/lative case. Note that in this example the \"pure\" dative/lative without its POSS-suffix is used.\n\"ʻAli-r\"\"Patʼi\"\"y-eti-x\"\nAliFatimalove\n\nThe dative case (\"yönelme durumu\") in Turkish language is formed by adding the <nowiki>\"</nowiki>-e\" or \"-a<nowiki>\"</nowiki> suffixes to the end of the noun, in accordance with the effected noun's vowel harmony. The word that should be in the dative case can be found as an answer to the questions 'neye?' (to what?), 'kime?' (to whom?) and 'nereye?' (to where?) will lead to find a dative case in a sentence. There are many different uses for the dative case.\n\nThe dative also is for objects, usually indirect objects, but sometimes objects that in English would be considered direct:\n\"Güneşin\"\n\"batışına\"\n\"bak.\"\nsun's\nat-its-sinking\nlook\nThe dative case tells \"whither\", that is, the place \"to which\". Thus it has roughly the meaning of the English prepositions \"to\" and \"into\", and also \"in\" when it can be replaced with \"into\":\n\"Birayı\"\n\"buzdolabına\"\n\"koy.\"\nthe-beer\ninto-icebox\nput\n\nBULLET::::- Dative construction\nBULLET::::- Declension in English\nBULLET::::- Double dative\n\nBULLET::::- German dative case A lesson covering the dative case in the German language\nBULLET::::- Hungarian dative case from www.

The most familiar dodecahedron is the regular dodecahedron, which is a Platonic solid. There are also three regular star dodecahedra, which are constructed as stellations of the convex form. All of these have icosahedral symmetry, order 120.\n\nThe pyritohedron, a common crystal form in pyrite, is an irregular pentagonal dodecahedron, having the same topology as the regular one but pyritohedral symmetry while the tetartoid has tetrahedral symmetry. The rhombic dodecahedron, seen as a limiting case of the pyritohedron, has octahedral symmetry. The elongated dodecahedron and trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron variations, along with the rhombic dodecahedra, are space-filling. There are numerous other dodecahedra.\n\nThe convex regular dodecahedron is one of the five regular Platonic solids and can be represented by its Schläfli symbol {5, 3}.\n\nThe dual polyhedron is the regular icosahedron {3, 5}, having five equilateral triangles around each vertex.\n\n+ Four kinds of regular dodecahedra\n<br>Convex regular dodecahedron\n<br>Small stellated dodecahedron\n<br>Great dodecahedron\n<br>Great stellated dodecahedron\nThe convex regular dodecahedron also has three stellations, all of which are regular star dodecahedra. They form three of the four Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. They are the small stellated dodecahedron {5/2, 5}, the great dodecahedron {5, 5/2}, and the great stellated dodecahedron {5/2, 3}. The small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are dual to each other; the great stellated dodecahedron is dual to the great icosahedron {3, 5/2}. All of these regular star dodecahedra have regular pentagonal or pentagrammic faces. The convex regular dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron are different realisations of the same abstract regular polyhedron; the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are different realisations of another abstract regular polyhedron.\n\nIn crystallography, two important dodecahedra can occur as crystal forms in some symmetry classes of the cubic crystal system that are topologically equivalent to the regular dodecahedron but less symmetrical: the pyritohedron with pyritohedral symmetry, and the tetartoid with tetrahedral symmetry:\n! style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\" colspan=\"2\"Pyritohedron\ncolspan=2Net<br>\n\nA pyritohedron is a dodecahedron with pyritohedral (T) symmetry. Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices (see figure). However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axis. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of rotational symmetry are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral pyrite, and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular Platonic solid form. The true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for quasicrystals (such as holmium–magnesium–zinc quasicrystal) with icosahedral symmetry, which includes true fivefold rotation axes.\n\nIts name comes from one of the two common crystal habits shown by pyrite, the other one being the cube.\n<br>Cubic pyrite\n<br>Pyritohedral pyrite\n\nThe coordinates of the eight vertices of the original cube are:\n\nThe coordinates of the 12 vertices of the cross-edges are:\n\nwhere \"h\" is the height of the wedge-shaped \"roof\" above the faces of the cube. When \"h\" = 1, the six cross-edges degenerate to points and a rhombic dodecahedron is formed. When \"h\" = 0, the cross-edges are absorbed in the facets of the cube, and the pyritohedron reduces to a cube. When \"h\" = , the multiplicative inverse of the golden ratio, the result is a regular dodecahedron. When \"h\" = , the conjugate of this value, the result is a regular great stellated dodecahedron.\n\nA reflected pyritohedron is made by swapping the nonzero coordinates above. The two pyritohedra can be superimposed to give the compound of two dodecahedra. The image to the left shows the case where the pyritohedra are convex regular dodecahedra.\n\nThe pyritohedron has a geometric degree of freedom with limiting cases of a cubic convex hull at one limit of collinear edges, and a rhombic dodecahedron as the other limit as 6 edges are degenerated to length zero. The regular dodecahedron represents a special intermediate case where all edges and angles are equal.\n\nIt is possible to go past these limiting cases, creating concave or nonconvex pyritohedra. The \"endo-dodecahedron\" is concave and equilateral; it can tessellate space with the convex regular dodecahedron. Continuing from there in that direction, we pass through a degenerate case where twelve vertices coincide in the centre, and on to the regular great stellated dodecahedron where all edges and angles are equal again, and the faces have been distorted into regular pentagrams. On the other side, past the rhombic dodecahedron, we get a nonconvex equilateral dodecahedron with fish-shaped self-intersecting equilateral pentagonal faces.\n\n+ Special cases of the pyritohedron\n!1 : 1\n!0 : 1\n!1 : 1\n!2 : 1\n!1 : 1\n!0 : 1\n!1 : 1\n!\"h\" = −\n!\"h\" = −1\n!\"h\" = \n!\"h\" = 0\n!\"h\" = \n!\"h\" = 1\n!\"h\" = \n<br>Regular star, great stellated dodecahedron, with regular pentagram faces\n<BR>Degenerate, 12 vertices in the center\n<br>The concave equilateral dodecahedron, called an \"endo-dodecahedron\".\n<br>A cube can be divided into a pyritohedron by bisecting all the edges, and faces in alternate directions.\n<br>A regular dodecahedron is an intermediate case with equal edge lengths.\n<br>A rhombic dodecahedron is a degenerate case with the 6 crossedges reduced to length zero.\n<BR>Self-intersecting equilateral dodecahedron\n\n! style=\"background:#e7dcc3;\" colspan=\"2\"Tetartoid<br>Tetragonal pentagonal dodecahedron\n\nA tetartoid (also tetragonal pentagonal dodecahedron, pentagon-tritetrahedron, and tetrahedric pentagon dodecahedron) is a dodecahedron with chiral tetrahedral symmetry (T). Like the regular dodecahedron, it has twelve identical pentagonal faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry. The mineral cobaltite can have this symmetry form.\n\n!cobaltite\n\nIts topology can be as a cube with square faces bisected into 2 rectangles like the pyritohedron, and then the bisection lines are slanted retaining 3-fold rotation at the 8 corners.\n\nThe following points are vertices of a tetartoid pentagon under tetrahedral symmetry:\nunder the following conditions:\n\nIt can be seen as a tetrahedron, with edges divided into 3 segments, along with a center point of each triangular face. In Conway polyhedron notation it can be seen as gT, a gyro tetrahedron.\n\n+ Example tetartoid variations\n\nA lower symmetry form of the regular dodecahedron can be constructed as the dual of a polyhedra constructed from two triangular anticupola connected base-to-base, called a \"triangular gyrobianticupola.\" It has D symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.\n\nThe \"rhombic dodecahedron\" is a zonohedron with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the quasiregular cuboctahedron (an Archimedean solid) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.\n\nThe \"rhombic dodecahedron\" can be seen as a degenerate pyritohedron where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron has several stellations, the first of which is also a parallelohedral spacefiller.\n\nAnother important rhombic dodecahedron, the Bilinski dodecahedron, has twelve faces congruent to those of the rhombic triacontahedron, i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the golden ratio. It is also a zonohedron and was described by Bilinski in 1960. This figure is another spacefiller, and can also occur in non-periodic spacefillings along with the rhombic triacontahedron, the rhombic icosahedron and rhombic hexahedra.\n\nThere are 6,384,634 topologically distinct \"convex\" dodecahedra, excluding mirror images—the number of vertices ranges from 8 to 20. (Two polyhedra are \"topologically distinct\" if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)\n\nTopologically distinct dodecahedra (excluding pentagonal and rhombic forms)\nBULLET::::- Uniform polyhedra:\nBULLET::::- Decagonal prism – 10 squares, 2 decagons, D symmetry, order 40.\nBULLET::::- Pentagonal antiprism – 10 equilateral triangles, 2 pentagons, D symmetry, order 20\nBULLET::::- Johnson solids (regular faced):\nBULLET::::- Pentagonal cupola – 5 triangles, 5 squares, 1 pentagon, 1 decagon, C symmetry, order 10\nBULLET::::- Snub disphenoid – 12 triangles, D, order 8\nBULLET::::- Elongated square dipyramid – 8 triangles and 4 squares, D symmetry, order 16\nBULLET::::- Metabidiminished icosahedron – 10 triangles and 2 pentagons, C symmetry, order 4\nBULLET::::- Congruent irregular faced: (face-transitive)\nBULLET::::- Hexagonal bipyramid – 12 isosceles triangles, dual of hexagonal prism, D symmetry, order 24\nBULLET::::- Hexagonal trapezohedron – 12 kites, dual of hexagonal antiprism, D symmetry, order 24\nBULLET::::- Triakis tetrahedron – 12 isosceles triangles, dual of truncated tetrahedron, T symmetry, order 24\nBULLET::::- Other less regular faced:\nBULLET::::- Hendecagonal pyramid – 11 isosceles triangles and 1 regular hendecagon, C, order 11\nBULLET::::- Trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron – 6 rhombi, 6 trapezoids – dual of triangular orthobicupola, D symmetry, order 12\nBULLET::::- Rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron or \"elongated Dodecahedron\" – 8 rhombi and 4 equilateral hexagons, D symmetry, order 16\nBULLET::::- Truncated pentagonal trapezohedron, D, order 20, topologically equivalent to regular dodecahedron\n\nBULLET::::- 120-cell: a regular polychoron (4D polytope) whose surface consists of 120 dodecahedral cells.\nBULLET::::- Pentakis dodecahedron\nBULLET::::- Snub dodecahedron\nBULLET::::- Truncated dodecahedron\nBULLET::::- Roman dodecahedron\n\nBULLET::::- \"Plato's Fourth Solid and the \"Pyritohedron\"\", by Paul Stephenson, 1993, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 77, No. 479 (Jul., 1993), pp. 220–226\nBULLET::::- THE GREEK ELEMENTS\nBULLET::::- Stellation of Pyritohedron VRML models and animations of Pyritohedron and its stellations\nBULLET::::- Editable printable net of a dodecahedron with interactive 3D view\nBULLET::::- The Uniform Polyhedra\nBULLET::::- Origami Polyhedra – Models made with Modular Origami\nBULLET::::- Dodecahedron – 3D model that works in your browser\nBULLET::::- Virtual Reality Polyhedra The Encyclopedia of Polyhedra\nBULLET::::- Dodecahedra variations\nBULLET::::- VRML models\nBULLET::::1.

{"id": "8408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8408", "title": "Darwin, Northern Territory", "text": "Darwin, Northern Territory\n\nDarwin ( ) is the capital city of the Northern Territory of Australia, situated on the Timor Sea. It is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a population of 148,564. It is the smallest, wettest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the Top End's regional centre.\n\nDarwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it a link between Australia and countries such as Indonesia and East Timor. The Stuart Highway begins in Darwin, extends southerly across central Australia through Tennant Creek and Alice Springs, concluding in Port Augusta, South Australia. The city is built upon a low bluff overlooking the harbour. Its suburbs begin at Lee Point in the north and stretch to Berrimah in the east. Past Berrimah, the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin's satellite city Palmerston and its suburbs.\n\nThe Darwin region, like much of the Top End, experiences a tropical climate with a wet and dry season. A period known locally as \"the build up\" leading up to Darwin's wet season sees temperature and humidity increase. Darwin's wet season typically arrives in late November to early December and brings with it heavy monsoonal downpours, spectacular lightning displays, and increased cyclone activity. During the dry season, the city has clear skies and mild sea breezes from the harbour.\n\nThe greater Darwin area is the ancestral home of the Larrakia people. On 9 September 1839, sailed into Darwin harbour during its survey of the area. John Clements Wickham named the region \"Port Darwin\" in honour of their former shipmate Charles Darwin, who had sailed with them on the ship's previous voyage which ended in October 1836. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, but it was renamed Darwin in 1911. The city has been almost entirely rebuilt four times, following devastation caused by the 1897 cyclone, the 1937 cyclone, Japanese air raids during World War II, and Cyclone Tracy in 1974.\n\nThe Aboriginal people of the Larrakia language group are the traditional custodians and the first inhabitants of the greater Darwin area. They had trading routes with Southeast Asia (see Macassan contact with Australia), and imported goods from as far afield as South and Western Australia. Established songlines penetrated throughout the country, allowing stories and histories to be told and retold along the routes. The extent of shared songlines and history of multiple clan groups within this area is still contestable.\n\nThe Dutch visited Australia's northern coastline in the 1600s and landed on the Tiwi Islands only to be repelled by the Tiwi peoples. The Dutch created the first European maps of the area. This accounts for the Dutch names in the area, such as Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt. The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of on 9 September 1839. The ship's captain, Commander John Clements Wickham, named the port after Charles Darwin, the British naturalist who had sailed with them both on the earlier second expedition of the \"Beagle\".\n\nIn 1863, the Northern Territory was transferred from New South Wales to South Australia. In 1864 South Australia sent B. T. Finniss north as Government Resident to survey and found a capital for its new territory. Finniss chose a site at Escape Cliffs, near the entrance to Adelaide River, about northeast of the modern city. This attempt was short-lived, however, and the settlement abandoned by 1865. On 5 February 1869, George Goyder, the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin between Fort Hill and the escarpment. Goyder named the settlement Palmerston, after the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston. In 1870, the first poles for the Overland Telegraph were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold by employees of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line digging holes for telegraph poles at Pine Creek in the 1880s spawned a gold rush which further boosted the young colony's development.\n\nIn February 1872 the brigantine \"Alexandra\" was the first private vessel to set sail from an English port directly to Darwin, carrying people many of whom were coming to recent gold finds.\n\nIn early 1875 Darwin's white population had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the left Darwin \"en route\" for Adelaide. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first furlough, and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the \"Gothenburg\" encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the Great Barrier Reef. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.\n\nIn the 1870s, relatively large numbers of Chinese settled at least temporarily in the Northern Territory; many were contracted to work the goldfields and later to build the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway. By 1888 there were 6122 Chinese in the Northern Territory, mostly in or around Darwin. The early Chinese settlers were mainly from the Guangdong Province in south China. However at the end of the nineteenth century anti-Chinese feelings grew in response to the 1890s economic depression and the White Australia policy meant many Chinese left the Territory. However, some families stayed and became Australian citizens, and established a commercial base in Darwin.\n\nThe Northern Territory was initially settled and administered by South Australia, until its transfer to the Commonwealth in 1911. In the same year, the city's official name changed from Palmerston to Darwin.\n\nThe period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by Harold Nelson, some 1000 demonstrators marched to Government House at Liberty Square in Darwin where they burnt an effigy of the Administrator of the Northern Territory John Gilruth and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the 'Darwin Rebellion'. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: Vestey's Meatworks and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterwards.\n\nAround 10,000 Australian and other Allied troops arrived in Darwin at the outset of World War II, in order to defend Australia's northern coastline. On 19 February 1942 at 0957, 188 Japanese warplanes attacked Darwin in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed Pearl Harbor, though a considerably larger number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town, airfields and aircraft. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of many raids on Darwin.\nDarwin was further developed after the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to Alice Springs to the south and Mount Isa to the south-east, and Manton Dam built in the south to provide the city with water. On Australia Day (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.\n\nOn 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by Cyclone Tracy, which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the city's buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces generated by the strong winds. After the disaster, 30,000 people of the population of 46,000 were evacuated, in what turned out to be the biggest airlift in Australia's history. The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former Brisbane Lord mayor Clem Jones. A satellite city of Palmerston was built east of Darwin in the early 1980s.\n\nOn 17 September 2003 the Adelaide–Darwin railway was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs-Darwin standard gauge line.\n\nDarwin has played host to many of aviation's early pioneers. On 10 December 1919 Captain Ross Smith and his crew landed in Darwin and won a £10,000 Prize from the Australian Government for completing the first flight from London to Australia in under thirty days. Smith and his Crew flew a Vickers Vimy, G-EAOU and landed on an airstrip that has now become Ross Smith Avenue.\n\nOther aviation pioneers include Amy Johnson, Amelia Earhart, Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and Bert Hinkler. The original QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd Hangar, a registered heritage site, was part of the original Darwin Civil Aerodrome in Parap and is now a museum and still bears scars from the bombing of Darwin during World War II.\n\nDarwin was home to Australian and US pilots during the war, with air strips being built in and around Darwin. Today Darwin provides a staging ground for military exercises.\n\nDarwin was a compulsory stop over/check point in the London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. The official name of the race was the MacRobertson Air Race. Winners of the great race were Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from \"Time\" magazine, 29 October 1934, Volume XXIV, Number 18.\n\nThe Australian Aviation Heritage Centre is located approximately from the City centre on the Stuart Highway and is one of only two places outside the United States where a B-52 bomber (on permanent loan from the United States Air Force) is on public display.\n\nDarwin lies in the Northern Territory, on the Timor Sea. The city proper occupies a low bluff overlooking Darwin Harbour, flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west. The remainder of the city is flat and low-lying, and coastal areas are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.\n\nDarwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older south-western suburbs—and the city itself—forming one corner, the newer northern suburbs another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.\n\nThe older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by Darwin International Airport and RAAF Base Darwin. Palmerston is a satellite city east of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of the fastest growing municipalities in Australia. The rural areas of Darwin including Howard Springs, Humpty Doo and Berry Springs are experiencing strong growth.\n\nDarwin's central business district is bounded by Daly Street in the north-west, McMinn Street in the north-east, Mitchell Street on the south-west and Bennett Street on the south-east. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, including the billion dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area including a convention centre with seating for 1500 people and approximately of exhibition space. The developers have announced that this will include hotels, residential apartments, and public space. The city's main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway going towards Palmerston, centred on Winnellie. The largest shopping precinct in the area is Casuarina Square.\n\nThe most expensive residential areas stand along the coast in suburbs such as the marina of Cullen Bay part of Larrakeyah, Bayview and Brinkin, despite the risk these low-lying regions face during cyclones and higher tides, adequate drainage and stringent building regulations have reduced the potential damage to buildings or injury to residents. The inner northern suburbs are home to lower-income households, although low-income Territory Housing units are scattered throughout the metropolitan area. The suburb of Lyons was part of a multi-stage land release and development in the Northern Suburbs; planning, development and construction took place from 2004 to 2009. More recent developments near Lyons subdivision includes the suburb of Muirhead.\n\nDarwin has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen \"Aw\") with distinct wet and dry seasons and the average maximum temperature is similar all year round. The dry season runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is sunny, and afternoon relative humidity averages around 30%.\n\nThe driest period of the year, seeing only approximately of monthly rainfall on average, is between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as , but very rarely lower, and a temperature lower than has never been recorded in the city centre. Outer suburbs away from the coast, however, can occasionally record temperatures as low as in the dry season. For an exceedingly lengthy 147‑day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation whatsoever. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in Northern Australia (particularly in the Northern Territory and northern regions of Western Australia) although a no-rainfall event of this extent is rare. The 3pm dewpoint average in the wet season is at around .\n\nExtreme temperatures at the Darwin Post Office Station have ranged from on 17 October 1892 to on 25 June 1891; while extreme temperatures at the Darwin Airport station (which is further from the coast and routinely records cooler temperatures than the post office station which is located in Darwin's CBD) have ranged from on 18 October 1982 to on 29 July 1942. The highest minimum temperature on record is on 18 January 1928 for the post office station and on both 25 November 1987 and 17 December 2014 for the airport station; while the lowest maximum temperature on record is on 3 June 1904 for the post office station and on 14 July 1968 for the airport station.\n\nThe wet season is associated with tropical cyclones and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months. It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days have plentiful cloud cover; January averages under 6 hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin's highest Bureau of Meteorology verified daily rainfall total is , which fell when Cyclone Carlos bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011. February 2011 was also Darwin's wettest month ever recorded, with recorded for the month at the airport.\n\nThe hottest month is November, just before the onset of the main rain season. The heat index sometimes rises above , while the actual temperature is usually below , because of humidity levels that most would find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second most daily average sunshine hours (8.4) of any Australian capital with the most sunshine from April to November; only Perth, Western Australia averages more (8.8). The sun passes directly overhead in mid October and mid February.\n\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from in July to in December.\n\nDarwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in Australia. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning squall line produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a radius of Darwin alone – about three times the amount of lightning that Perth, Western Australia, experiences on average in an entire year.\n\nDarwin is one of the fastest-growing capital cities in Australia, with an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent since the 2006 census. In recent years, the Palmerston and Litchfield parts of the Darwin statistical division have recorded the highest growth in population of any Northern Territory local government area, and by 2016 Litchfield could overtake Palmerston as the second-largest municipality in metropolitan Darwin. It is predicted by 2021 that the combined population of both Palmerston and Litchfield will be 101,546 people.\n\nIn 2011, the Darwin population averaged 33 years old (compared to the national average of around 37 years) assisted to a large extent by the military presence and the fact that many people opt to retire elsewhere.\n\n!colspan=\"2\"Country of Birth (2016)\n! Birthplace  Population\n\nDarwin's population changed after the Second World War. Darwin, like many other Australian cities, experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of Italians and Greeks during the 1960s and 1970s. Darwin also started to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the Dutch, Germans, and many others. A significant percentage of Darwin's residents are recent immigrants from Asia, including the peoples of East Timor.\n\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: \n38.3% of the population was born overseas at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from the Philippines (3.6%), England (3.1%), New Zealand (2.1%), India (2%) and Greece (0.9%).\n\n8.7% of the population, or 11,960 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016. This is the largest proportion of any Australian capital city.\n\nAt the 2016 census, 58% of the population spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Tagalog and Filipino (3.1%), Greek (2.3%), Mandarin (1.4%) and Indonesian (0.8%).\n\nChristianity has the most adherents in Darwin, with 56,613 followers accounting for 49.5 per cent of the population of the city. The largest denominations of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (24,538 or 21.5 per cent), Anglicanism (14,028 or 12.3 per cent) and Greek Orthodoxy (2,964 or 2.6 per cent). Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Jews account for 3.2 per cent of Darwin's population. There were 26,695 or 23.3 per cent of people professing no religion.\n\nThe Darwin City Council (Incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the City of Darwin which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The city has been governed by a City Council form of government since 1957. The council consists of 13 elected members, the Lord Mayor, and 12 aldermen.\n\nThe City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The names of the wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three aldermen. Constituents of all wards are directly responsible for electing the Lord Mayor of Darwin. The mayor is Kon Vatskalis after council elections in August 2017.\n\nThe rest of the Darwin area is divided into two local government areas—the Palmerston City Council and the Shire of Coomalie. These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the Northern Territory Government, such as planning and garbage collection.\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory Parliament House. Government House, the official residence of the Administrator of the Northern Territory, is located on The Esplanade.\n\nDarwin is split between nine electoral divisions in the Legislative Assembly—Port Darwin, Fannie Bay, Fong Lim, Nightcliff, Sanderson, Johnston, Casuarina, Wanguri, and Karama. Historically, Darwin voters elected Country Liberal Party members. However, since the turn of the 21st century, voters have often selected Labor members, particularly in the more diverse northern section.\n\nAlso located on the Esplanade is the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Darwin has a Magistrate's Court which is also located on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett Streets quite close to the Darwin City Council Chambers.\n\nDarwin's police force are members of the Northern Territory Police Force, under the NT Police Darwin Metropolitan Command. The Darwin urban centre includes Darwin City and the associated suburbs from Buffalo Creek, Berrimah and East Arm westwards, representing around 35% of the Northern Territory's population. Palmerston urban centre closely approximates the Palmerston Local Government Area, and represents approximately 13% of the Northern Territory's population.\n\nDarwin has had a history of alcohol abuse and violent crime, with 6,000 assaults in 2009, of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses – more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital.\n\nMitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, clubs and other entertainment venues, was one of the areas policed by the CitySafe Unit, officially launched by the NT Chief Minister Paul Henderson on 25 February 2009, was credited with success in tackling alcohol abuse linked to crime, and the NT police were looking at establishing a specialist licensing enforcement unit in 2010.\n\nThe First Response Patrol, run by Larrakia Nation, which helps to move homeless Indigenous women out of dangerous situations, was credited with the fall in sexual assaults in 2009. The service operates every day from 5am to 2am.\n\nIn the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the alcohol floor price and various other measures were imposed by the NT government following the Riley Review, and 31 July 2019, alcohol-related assaults dropped by 16% and domestic violence by 9% in the Darwin area.\n\nThe rate of offending in most categories of crime dropped in the Darwin urban area between 2018 and 2019, with the notable exceptions of motor vehicle theft and break-ins (both up about 12%). Apart from sexual assault, which rose from 21 to 46, all other categories of crime showed drops in Palmerston.\n\nThe two largest economic sectors are mining and tourism. Given its location, Darwin serves as a \"gateway\" for Australian travellers to Asia.\n\nMining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5 billion per annum. The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc and bauxite, along with manganese and many others. The energy production is mostly off shore with oil and natural gas from the Timor Sea, although there are significant uranium deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents, and is expected to grow as domestic and international tourists are now spending time in Darwin during the Wet and Dry seasons. Federal spending is also a major contributor to the local economy.\n\nDarwin's importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea, and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with Asia.\nDuring 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including Outrigger Pandanas and Evolution on Gardiner, retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The Chinatown project has also started with plans to construct Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.\n\nTourism is one of Darwin's largest industries. Tourism is a major industry and employment sector for the Northern Territory.\nIn 2005/06, 1.38 million people visited the Northern Territory. They stayed for 9.2 million nights and spent over $1.5 billion.\nThe tourism industry directly employed 8,391 Territorians in June 2006 and when indirect employment is included, tourism typically accounts for more than 14,000 jobs across the Territory.\n\nDarwin is a hub for tours to Kakadu National Park, Litchfield National Park and Katherine Gorge.\nThe Territory is traditionally divided into the wet and dry, but there are up to six traditional seasons in Darwin.\nIt is warm and sunny from May to September. Humidity rises during the green season, from October to April bringing thunderstorms and monsoonal rains which rejuvenates the landscape. Tourism is largely seasonal with most tourists visiting during the cooler dry season which runs from April to September.\n\nThe military presence that is maintained both within Darwin, and the wider Northern Territory, is a substantial source of employment. \nOn 16 November 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and President Barack Obama announced that the United States would station troops in Australia for the first time since World War II. The agreement between the United States and Australia would involve a contingent of 250 Marines arriving in Darwin in 2012, with the total number rising to a maximum of 2,500 troops by 2017 on six-month rotations as well as a supporting air element including F-22 Raptors, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and KC-135 refuelers. China and Indonesia have expressed concern about the decision. Some analysts have argued that an expanded U.S. presence could pose a threat to security.\nGillard announced that the first 200 U.S. Marines had arrived in Darwin from Hawaii on late 3 April 2012. In 2013, further news of other expansion vectors was aired in USA media, with no comment or confirmation from Australian authorities. The agreement between the two governments remains hidden from public scrutiny. Marine numbers based in Darwin increased to more than 1,150 troops by 2014.\n\nDarwin hosts biennial multi-nation exercises named \"Pitch Black\"; in 2014 this involved military personnel from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.\n\nEducation is overseen territory-wide by the Department of Education and Training (DET), whose role is to continually improve education outcomes for all students, with a focus on Indigenous students.\n\nDarwin is served by a number of public and private schools that cater to local and overseas students. Over 16,500 primary and secondary students are enrolled in schools in Darwin, with 10,524 students attending primary education, and 5,932 students attending secondary education. There are over 12,089 students enrolled in government schools and 2,124 students enrolled in independent schools.\nThere were 9,764 students attending schools in the City of Darwin area. 6,045 students attended primary schools and 3,719 students attended secondary schools.

There are over 35 primary and pre – schools, and 12 secondary schools including both government and non-government. Most schools in the city are secular, but there are a small number of Christian, Catholic and Lutheran institutions. Students intending to complete their secondary education can work towards either the Northern Territory Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate (only offered at Kormilda College). Schools have been restructured into Primary, Middle and High schools since the beginning of 2007.\n\nDarwin's largest University is the Charles Darwin University, which is the central provider of tertiary education in the Northern Territory. It covers both vocational and academic courses, acting as both a university and an Institute of TAFE. There are over 5,500 students enrolled in tertiary and further education courses.\n\nOn 1 July, Territorians celebrate Territory Day. This is the only day of the year, apart from the Chinese New Year and New Year's Eve, when fireworks are permitted. In Darwin, the main celebrations occur at Mindil Beach, where a large firework display is commissioned by the government.\n\nWeekly markets include Mindil Beach Sunset Markets (Thursdays and Sundays during the dry season), Parap Market, Nightcliff Market and Rapid Creek market. Mindil Beach Sunset Markets are very popular with locals and tourists alike and feature food, souvenirs, clothes and local performing artists.\n\nThe Darwin Festival held annually, includes comedy, dance, theatre, music, film and visual art and the NT Indigenous Music Awards. Other festivals include the Glenti, which showcases Darwin's large Greek community, and India@Mindil, a similar festival held by the smaller Indian community. The Chinese New Year is also celebrated with great festivity, highlighting the Asian influence in Darwin.\n\nThe Seabreeze festival, which first started in 2005, is held on the second week of May in the suburb of Nightcliff. It offers the opportunity for local talent to be showcased and a popular event is Saturday family festivities along the Nightcliff foreshore which is one of Darwin's most popular fitness tracks.\n\nThe Speargrass Festival is held annually the week prior to July's first full moon and celebrates the alternative Top End lifestyle. The festival activities include music, screening of locally produced films, screen printing, basket weaving, sweat lodge, water slides, human pyramid, hot tub, frisbee golf, spear throwing, Kubb competition, bingo, communal organic cooking, morning yoga, meditation, greasy pig and healing circles. The festival occurs at the Speargrass property, northeast of Pine Creek.\n\nThe Darwin beer-can regatta, held in August, celebrates Darwin's love affair with beer and contestants' race boats made exclusively of beer cans. Also in Darwin during the month of August, are the Darwin Cup horse race, and the Rodeo and Mud Crab Tying Competition.\n\nThe World Solar Challenge race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987.\n\nThe Royal Darwin Show is held annually in July at the Winnellie Showgrounds. Exhibitions include agriculture and livestock. Horse events.

Other theatres include the Darwin Convention Centre, opened in July 2008. The Darwin Convention Centre is part of the $1.1 billion Darwin Waterfront project.\n\nDarwin's only casino opened in 1979 as the \"Don Casino\" operating out of the Don Hotel on Cavenagh Street. The present site of the hotel and casino on Darwin's Mindil Beach opened in 1983 at which point gambling operations ceased at the Don Hotel and commenced at the newly built facilities. The new hotel and casino was named \"Mindil Beach Casino\" up until 1985 when the name changed to the \"Diamond Beach Hotel Casino\". Upon the acquisition by MGM Grand the hotel was re-branded as the MGM Grand Darwin, before it changed to Skycity Darwin after Skycity Entertainment Group purchased the hotel in 2004.\n\nThe Northern Territory Museum and Art Gallery (MAGNT) in Darwin gives an overview of the history of the area, including exhibits on Cyclone Tracy and the boats of the Pacific Islands. The MAGNT also organises the annual Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, the longest running Indigenous art award in Australia. The MAGNT also manages the Defence of Darwin Experience, a multi-media installation that tells the story of the Japanese air raids on Darwin during World War II.\n\nThe Darwin Festival and the Darwin Fringe Festival are annual events. A range of art galleries including specialised Aboriginal art galleries are a feature of Darwin.\n\nLocal and visiting musical bands can be heard at venues including the Darwin Entertainment Centre, The Vic Hotel, Happy Yess, and Brown's Mart. A yearly music festival, Bass in the Grass, is very popular with youth from the surrounding area. Artists such as Jessica Mauboy and The Groovesmiths call Darwin home.\n\nThere have been no major films set in Darwin; however, some scenes for \"Australia\" by Baz Luhrmann and \"Black Water\" were both shot in Darwin in 2007\n\nMitchell Street in the central business district is lined with nightclubs, takeaways, and restaurants. This is the city's entertainment hub. There are several smaller theatres, three cinema complexes (CBD, Casuarina, and Palmerston), and the Deckchair Cinema. This is an open-air cinema which operates through the dry season, from April to October, and screens independent and arthouse films.\n\nAs Darwin was destroyed by cyclones several times and suffered severe bomb damage during World War II there are few historic buildings left in town. The \"Administrator's Office\" dating from 1883 was used as a law court and as a police station and was only slightly damaged by bombs. In 1974, however, it was completely destroyed by the cyclone. In 1979 it was decided to rebuild the ruin and the reconstruction was finished in 1981. The building houses Government offices today. Opposite the building \"Survivors Lookout\" offers a beautiful view of the marina.\nIn a park in the South of the CBD the ruin of the Town Hall which had been built in 1883 and destroyed by the cylone in 1974 can be seen. \"Browns Mart\" is a stone building dating from 1880 opposite the park. Originally Browns Mart was the bourse of a mining company but later it was transformed into a theatre.\n\nOne of the most prominent buildings of Darwin is the Chinese Temple which was founded in 1887 and damaged by cyclones in 1897 and in 1937. In 1942 it was severely damaged by bombs and rebuilt after the war. On 24 December 1974 it was completely destroyed by the cyclone. The reconstruction was completed in 1978.\n\nThere are various modern churches in Darwin. St Mary's Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Cathedral was inaugurated in 1962. Christ Church Anglican Cathedral was rebuilt in 1977 after it had been severely damaged by bombs in 1942 and destroyed by cyclone Tracy in 1974. The Uniting Memorial Church was built in 1960.\n\nThe city has many kilometres of beaches, including the Casuarina Beach and renowned Mindil Beach, home of the Mindil Beach markets. Darwin City Council has designated an area of Casuarina Beach as a free beach which has been designated as a nudist beach area since 1976.\nDuring the months of October–May the sea contains deadly box jellyfish, known locally as Stingers or Sea Wasps.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles are common in all waterways surrounding Darwin and are even occasionally found swimming in Darwin Harbour and on local beaches. An active trapping program is carried out by the NT Government to limit numbers of crocodiles within the Darwin urban waterway area.\n\nFishing is one of the recreations of Darwin locals. Visitors fish for the barramundi, an iconic fish for the region. This fish thrives in the Mary River, Daly River, South and East Alligator River.\n\nBlue-water fishing is also available off the coast of Darwin; Spanish mackerel, Black Jewfish, queenfish, and snapper are found in the area. Lake Alexander is a man-made swimming lake which is located at East Point Reserve. It has been considered crocodile and jellyfish safe. An outbreak of non-deadly jellyfish in 2003 caused its closure for a brief period of time. \n\nThe Darwin Surf Lifesaving Club operates long boats and surf skis and provides events and lifesaving accreditations.\n\nDarwin has extensive parks and gardens. These include the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens, East Point Reserve, Casuarina Coastal Reserve, Charles Darwin National Park, Knuckey Lagoons Conservation Reserve, Leanyer Recreation Park, the Nightcliff Foreshore, Bicentennial Park and the Jingili Water Gardens.\n\nThe Marrara Sports Complex near the airport has stadiums for Aussie Rules (TIO Stadium), cricket, rugby union, basketball (and indoor court sports), soccer, athletics and field hockey.

{"id": "8409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8409", "title": "Dictator", "text": "Dictator\n\nA dictator is a political leader who possesses absolute power. A dictatorship is a state ruled by one dictator or by a small clique. The word originated as the title of a magistrate in the Roman Republic appointed by the Senate to rule the republic in times of emergency (see Roman dictator and \"justitium\").\n\nLike the term \"tyrant\" (which was originally a non-pejorative Ancient Greek title), and to a lesser degree \"autocrat\", \"dictator\" came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive rule. Thus, in modern usage, the term \"dictator\" is generally used to describe a leader who holds or abuses an extraordinary amount of personal power. Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of elections and civil liberties; proclamation of a state of emergency; rule by decree; repression of political opponents; not abiding by the rule of law procedures, and cult of personality. Dictatorships are often one-party or dominant-party states.\n\nA wide variety of leaders coming to power in different kinds of regimes, such as military juntas, one-party states, dominant-party states, and civilian governments under a personal rule, have been described as dictators. They may hold left or right-wing views, or may be apolitical.\n\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the Roman Republic, the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a magistrate given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal Consular rule whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with Cornelius Sulla's ascension to the dictatorship following Sulla's second civil war, making himself the first Dictator in Rome in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as \"de facto\" eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. Julius Caesar followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed \"Dictator perpetuo\", \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until his assassination the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir Augustus was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term \"dictator\" had occasional positive implications. For example, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the national leader Lajos Kossuth was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president. When creating a provisional executive in Sicily during the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see Dictatorship of Garibaldi). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 January Uprising in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being Ludwik Mierosławski. \nPast that time, however, the term \"dictator\" assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a \"dictatorship\" is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with megalomania. Many dictators create a cult of personality around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, Idi Amin Dada, who had been a British army lieutenant prior to Uganda's independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"\"His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular\"\". In the movie \"The Great Dictator\" (1940), Charlie Chaplin satirized not only Adolf Hitler but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator. A benevolent dictator may allow for some economic liberalization or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referenda or elected representatives with limited power, and often makes preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term. It might be seen as a republican form of enlightened despotism.\n\nThe label has been applied to leaders such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, and Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore. \n\nThe association between a dictator and the military is a common one; many dictators take great pains to emphasize their connections with the military and they often wear military uniforms. In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; Francisco Franco was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became Chief of State of Spain; Manuel Noriega was officially commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of crowd manipulation, such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco. Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of propaganda daily, often built around a cult of personality.\n\nBecause of its negative and pejorative connotations, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term \"dictator\" in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of president. In the 19th century, however, its official usage was more common:\nBULLET::::- Hungary\nBULLET::::- Artúr Görgei was styled Dictator from 11 August 13 August 1849, during the last days of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.\nBULLET::::- Italy\nBULLET::::- In the former city-state of Venice, and while it was a republic resisting annexation by either the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia or the Austrian empire, a former Chief Executive (president, 23 March 1848 5 July 1848), Daniele Manin (b. 1804 d. 1857), was styled Dictator 11–13 August 1848 before joining the 13 August 1848 7 March 1849 Triumvirate.\nBULLET::::- The Dictatorial Government of Sicily (27 May 4 November 1860) was a provisional executive government appointed by Giuseppe Garibaldi to rule Sicily.

Tarkovsky was Dictator of the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus\n\nUnder the Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, government policy was enforced by extrajudicial killings, secret police (originally known as the \"Cheka\") and the notorious Gulag system of concentration camps. Most Gulag inmates were not political prisoners, although significant numbers of political prisoners could be found in the camps at any one time. Data collected from Soviet archives gives the death toll from Gulags at 1,053,829. Other human rights abuses by the Soviet state included human experimentation, the use of psychiatry as a political weapon and the denial of freedoms of religion, assembly, speech and association.\n\nPol Pot became dictator of Cambodia in 1975. In all, an estimated 1.7 million people (out of a population of 7 million) died due to the policies of his four-year dictatorship. As a result, Pol Pot is sometimes described as \"the Hitler of Cambodia\" and \"a genocidal tyrant\".\nThe International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Sudan's military dictator Omar al-Bashir over alleged war crimes in Darfur.\n\nIn social choice theory, the notion of a dictator is formally defined as a person who can achieve any feasible social outcome he/she wishes. The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\nBULLET::::- \"The strong dictator\" has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like Sulla.\nBULLET::::- \"The weak dictator\" has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the \"weak\" dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the \"weak\" dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is Lorenzo the Magnificent, who controlled Renaissance Florence.\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in propaganda and controlling public opinion. Monarchs and military dictators are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the nobility or the army)..\n\nBULLET::::- Authoritarian personality\nBULLET::::- Benevolent dictator for life\nBULLET::::- Benevolent dictatorship\nBULLET::::- Dictator novel\nBULLET::::- Emergency powers\nBULLET::::- List of coups d'état and coup attempts\nBULLET::::- List of coups d'état and coup attempts by country\nBULLET::::- List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office\nBULLET::::- List of political leaders who suspended the constitution\nBULLET::::- Lists of state leaders by year\nBULLET::::- Maximum Leader (disambiguation)\nBULLET::::- Military rule (disambiguation)\nBULLET::::- Strongman (politics)\nBULLET::::- Supreme Leader\n\nBULLET::::- A He conferred a doctorate of law on himself from Makerere University.\nBULLET::::- B The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British Victoria Cross.\n\n\nBULLET::::- Current Dictators of the World\nBULLET::::- WorldStatesmen\n"}
{"id": "8410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8410", "title": "Decibel", "text": "Decibel\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:right;\"  dB\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"  Power ratio\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"  Amplitude ratio\n\nThe decibel (symbol: dB) is a unit of measurement used to express the ratio of one value of a power or field quantity to another, on a logarithmic scale, the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively. It can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1 dB or −1 dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1 volt, then the suffix is \"V\" (e.g., \"20 dBV\"), and if the reference value is one milliwatt, then the suffix is \"m\" (e.g., \"20 dBm\").\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its logarithm to base 10. That is, a change in \"power\" by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10 dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in \"amplitude\" by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20 dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. One decibel is one tenth (deci-) of one bel, named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most prominently in acoustics, electronics, and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the International System of Quantities, the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type level or level difference, which are defined as the logarithm of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.\n\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally \"Miles of Standard Cable\" (MSC). 1 MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1 mile (approximately 1.6 km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000 radians per second (795.8 Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 Ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054 microfarads per mile\" (approximately corresponding to 19 gauge wire).\n\nIn 1924, Bell Telephone Laboratories received favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony in Europe and replaced the MSC with the \"Transmission Unit\" (TU). 1 TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power.\nThe definition was conveniently chosen such that 1 TU approximated 1 MSC; specifically, 1 MSC was 1.056 TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU into the decibel, being one tenth of a newly defined unit for the base-10 logarithm of the power ratio. It was named the \"bel\", in honor of the telecommunications pioneer Alexander Graham Bell.\nThe bel is seldom used, as the decibel was the proposed working unit.\n\nThe naming and early definition of the decibel is described in the NBS Standard's Yearbook of 1931:\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name 'logit' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".\n\nIn April 2003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the International System of Units (SI), but decided against the proposal. However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The IEC permits the use of the decibel with field quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as NIST, which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios. The term \"field quantity\" is deprecated by ISO 80000-1, which favors root-power. In spite of their widespread use, suffixes (such as in dBA or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\nISO 80000-3 describes definitions for quantities and units of space and time. The decibel for use in acoustics is defined in . The major difference from the article below is that for acoustics the decibel has no absolute value.\n\nThe ISO Standard 80000-3:2006 defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: . The bel (B) is  ln(10) nepers: . The neper is the change in the level of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of \"e\", that is , thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, . Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of :1.\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10 (1.12202).\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with SI unit prefixes other than \"deci\"; it is preferred, for example, to use \"hundredths of a decibel\" rather than \"millibels\". Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written '0.05 dB', and not '5 mB'.\n\nThe method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a \"power quantity\" or a \"root-power quantity\"; see \"Field, power, and root-power quantities\" for details.\n\nWhen referring to measurements of \"power\" quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of \"P\" (measured power) to \"P\" (reference power) is represented by \"L\", that ratio expressed in decibels, which is calculated using the formula:\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel). \"P\" and \"P\" must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If in the above equation, then \"L\" = 0. If \"P\" is greater than \"P\" then \"L\" is positive; if \"P\" is less than \"P\" then \"L\" is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for \"P\" in terms of \"P\" and \"L\":\n\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of \"F\" (measured field) and \"F\" (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n\nSimilarly, in electrical circuits, dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of voltage or current when the impedance is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level \"L\":\nwhere \"V\" is the root-mean-square (rms) output voltage, \"V\" is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term \"root-power quantity\" is introduced by ISO Standard 80000-1:2009 as a substitute of \"field quantity\". The term \"field quantity\" is deprecated by that standard.\n\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels. A factor of 2 is introduced to make \"changes\" in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the \"same\" waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time. This relies on the relationship\nholding. In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity. However, even in a linear system in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. voltage and current), if the impedance is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities \"P\" and \"F\" need not be related), or equivalently,\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power \"P\" and \"V\" to \"P\" and \"V\". An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0 dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified. Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities power spectral density and the associated field quantities via the Fourier transform, which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !! In decibels !! In bels !! In nepers !! Power ratio !! Field ratio\n\nThe unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a reference point.\nBULLET::::- Calculating the ratio in decibels of (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to yields:\nBULLET::::- The ratio in decibels of to is\n, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that \"L\" has the same value, 30 dB, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\nBULLET::::- The ratio in decibels of (one milliwatt) to is obtained with the formula\nBULLET::::- The power ratio corresponding to a change in level is given by\n\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of . A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or is approximately a change of 3 dB. More precisely, the change is ±3.0103 dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3 dB\" in technical writing. This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of . Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6 dB\" rather than ±6.0206 dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional significant figures. 3.000 dB is a power ratio of 10, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly . Similarly, an increase of 6.000 dB is the power ratio is , about 0.5% different from 4.\n\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\nThe logarithmic scale nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to scientific notation. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See \"Bode plot\" and \"Semi-log plot\". For example, 120 dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, = log(\"A\") + log(\"B\") + log(\"C\"). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1 dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3 dB is approximately 2× power gain, and 10 dB is 10× power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\nBULLET::::- A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10 dB, 8 dB, and 7 dB respectively, for a total gain of 25 dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1 dB, this is:\nBULLET::::- 25 dB = 10 dB + 10 dB + 3 dB + 1 dB + 1 dB\nBULLET::::- With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\nBULLET::::- 1 W × 10 × 10 × 2 × 1.26 × 1.26 ≈ 317.5 W\nBULLET::::- Calculated exactly, the output is 1 W × 10 = 316.2 W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of slide rules than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.\n\nAccording to Mitschke, \"The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations: \"if two machines each individually produce a sound pressure level of, say, 90 dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93 dB, but certainly not to 180 dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87 dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83 dBA. [...] the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83 dBA background noise from the combined level of 87 dBA; i.e., 84.8 dBA.\"; \"in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. [...] Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of [...] 70 dB and 90 dB: logarithmic average = 87 dB; arithmetic average = 80 dB.\"\n\nAddition on a logarithmic scale is called logarithmic addition, and can be defined by taking exponentials to convert to a linear scale, adding there, and then taking logarithms to return. For example, where operations on decibels are logarithmic addition/subtraction and logarithmic multiplication/division, while operations on the linear scale are the usual operations:\nNote that the logarithmic mean is obtained from the logarithmic sum by subtracting formula_14, since logarithmic division is linear subtraction.\nQuantities in decibels are not necessarily additive, thus being \"of unacceptable form for use in dimensional analysis\".\n\nThe human perception of the intensity of sound and light approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship (Weber–Fechner law), making the dB scale a useful measure.\n\nThe decibel is commonly used in acoustics as a unit of sound pressure level. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure. Sound pressure is a field quantity, therefore the field version of the unit definition is used:\nwhere \"p\" is the root mean square of the measured sound pressure and \"p\" is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals in air or 1 micropascal in water.\n\nUse of the decibel in underwater acoustics leads to confusion, in part because of this difference in reference value.\n\nThe human ear has a large dynamic range in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 10 is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120 dB re 20 μPa.\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4 kHz, are factored more heavily into some measurements using frequency weighting. (See also Stevens' power law.)\n\nThe main instrument used for measuring sound levels in the environment and in the workplace is the Sound Level Meter. Most sound level meters provide readings in A, C, and Z-weighted decibels and must meet international standards such as IEC 61672-2013.\n\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for gains) in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a link budget.\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"dBm\". A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259 mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the dBu. This is relative to the root mean square voltage which delivers 1 mW (0 dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or ≈ 0.775 V. When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are identical.\n\nIn an optical link, if a known amount of optical power, in dBm (referenced to 1 mW), is launched into a fiber, and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the blocking unit used to measure optical density is equivalent to −1 B.\n\nIn connection with video and digital image sensors, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a CCD imager where response voltage is linear in intensity.\nThus, a camera signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range quoted as 40 dB represents a ratio of 100:1 between optical signal intensity and optical-equivalent dark-noise intensity, not a 10,000:1 intensity (power) ratio as 40 dB might suggest.\nSometimes the 20 log ratio definition is applied to electron counts or photon counts directly, which are proportional to sensor signal amplitude without the need to consider whether the voltage response to intensity is linear.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the 10 log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics, including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the stop, to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard SI prefixes. Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside SI units, the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not. The proper way, according to the IEC 60027-3, is either as \"L\" (re \"x\") or as \"L\", where \"x\" is the quantity symbol and \"x\" is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., \"L\" (re 1 μV/m) = \"L\" for the electric field strength \"E\" relative to 1 μV/m reference value.\n\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of μV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"λ\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a hyphen, as in \"dBHz\", or with a space, as in \"dB HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\nBULLET::::- dBV: dB(V) – voltage relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance. This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer line-level of , in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a line-level signal.\n\nBULLET::::- dBu or dBv: RMS voltage relative to An RMS voltage of 1 V therefore corresponds to formula_16 Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV. The \"v\" comes from \"volt\", while \"u\" comes from the volume \"unit\" used in the VU meter. dBu can be used as a measure of voltage, regardless of impedance, but is derived from a 600 Ω load dissipating 0 dBm (1 mW). The reference voltage comes from the computation </math>.}} In professional audio, equipment may be calibrated to indicate a \"0\" on the VU meters some finite time after a signal has been applied at an amplitude of . Consumer equipment typically uses a lower \"nominal\" signal level of . Therefore, many devices offer dual voltage operation (with different gain or \"trim\" settings) for interoperability reasons. A switch or adjustment that covers at least the range between and is common in professional equipment.\n\nBULLET::::- dBu0s\n\nBULLET::::- dBm0s\n\nBULLET::::- dBμV or dBuV: dB(μV) – voltage relative to 1 microvolt. Widely used in television and aerial amplifier specifications. 60 dBμV = 0 dBmV.\n\nProbably the most common usage of \"decibels\" in reference to sound level is dB SPL, sound pressure level referenced to the nominal threshold of human hearing: The measures of pressure (a field quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dB SIL and dB SWL) use the factor of 10.\nBULLET::::- dB SPL: dB SPL (sound pressure level) – for sound in air and other gases, relative to 20 micropascals (μPa), or , approximately the quietest sound a human can hear. For sound in water and other liquids, a reference pressure of 1 μPa is used. An RMS sound pressure of one pascal corresponds to a level of 94 dB SPL.\nBULLET::::- dB SIL: dB sound intensity level – relative to 10 W/m², which is roughly the threshold of human hearing in air.\nBULLET::::- dB SWL: dB sound power level – relative to 10 W.\nBULLET::::- dBA, dBB, and dBC: These symbols are often used to denote the use of different weighting filters, used to approximate the human ear's response to sound, although the measurement is still in dB (SPL). These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB or dB(A). According to ANSI standards, the preferred usage is to write L = x dB. Nevertheless, the units dBA and dB(A) are still commonly used as a shorthand for Aweighted measurements. Compare dBc, used in telecommunications.\nBULLET::::- dB HL: dB hearing level is used in audiograms as a measure of hearing loss. The reference level varies with frequency according to a minimum audibility curve as defined in ANSI and other standards, such that the resulting audiogram shows deviation from what is regarded as 'normal' hearing.\nBULLET::::- dB Q: sometimes used to denote weighted noise level, commonly using the ITU-R 468 noise weighting\nBULLET::::- dBpp: relative to the peak to peak sound pressure.\nBULLET::::- dBG: Gweighted spectrum\n\nSee also dBV and dBu above.\n\nBULLET::::- dBm: dB(mW) – power relative to 1 milliwatt.

Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale sinusoid or alternatively a full-scale square wave. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave appears 3 dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0 dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = −3 dBFS(fullscale square wave).\nBULLET::::- dBVU: dB volume unit\nBULLET::::- dBTP: dB(true peak) – peak amplitude of a signal compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. In digital systems, 0 dBTP would equal the highest level (number) the processor is capable of representing. Measured values are always negative or zero, since they are less than or equal to full-scale.\n\nBULLET::::- dBZ: dB(Z) – decibel relative to Z = 1 mm⋅m: energy of reflectivity (weather radar), related to the amount of transmitted power returned to the radar receiver. Values above 20 dBZ usually indicate falling precipitation.\nBULLET::::- dBsm: dB(m²) – decibel relative to one square meter: measure of the radar cross section (RCS) of a target. The power reflected by the target is proportional to its RCS. \"Stealth\" aircraft and insects have negative RCS measured in dBsm, large flat plates or non-stealthy aircraft have positive values.\n\nBULLET::::- dBc: relative to carrier – in telecommunications, this indicates the relative levels of noise or sideband power, compared with the carrier power. Compare dBC, used in acoustics.\nBULLET::::- dBpp: relative to the maximum value of the peak power.\nBULLET::::- dBJ: energy relative to 1 joule. 1 joule = 1 watt second = 1 watt per hertz, so power spectral density can be expressed in dBJ.\nBULLET::::- dBm: dB(mW) – power relative to 1 milliwatt. In the radio field, dBm is usually referenced to a 50 Ω load, with the resultant voltage being 0.224 volts.\nBULLET::::- dBμV/m, dBuV/m, or dBμ: dB(μV/m) – electric field strength relative to 1 microvolt per meter. The unit is often used to specify the signal strength of a television broadcast at a receiving site (the signal measured \"at the antenna output\" is reported in dBμV).\nBULLET::::- dBf: dB(fW) – power relative to 1 femtowatt.\nBULLET::::- dBW: dB(W) – power relative to 1 watt.\nBULLET::::- dBk: dB(kW) – power relative to 1 kilowatt.\nBULLET::::- dBe: dB electrical.\nBULLET::::- dBo: dB optical.

E.g., 20 dBHz corresponds to a bandwidth of 100 Hz. Commonly used in link budget calculations. Also used in carrier-to-noise-density ratio (not to be confused with carrier-to-noise ratio, in dB).\nBULLET::::- dBov or dBO: dB(overload) – the amplitude of a signal (usually audio) compared with the maximum which a device can handle before clipping occurs. Similar to dBFS, but also applicable to analog systems. According to ITU-T Rec.

{"id": "8411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8411", "title": "Darwinism", "text": "Darwinism\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term \"Darwinism\" in April 1860.\n\nDarwinism subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the Weismann barrier, or the central dogma of molecular biology. Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work, in place of other theories, including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.\n\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term \"Darwinism\" in April 1860. It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher Herbert Spencer. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of German evolutionary biologist August Weismann gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called \"the eclipse of Darwinism\", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern synthesis in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in an updated form.\n\nWhile the term \"Darwinism\" has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as Olivia Judson and Eugenie Scott that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory. For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of heredity. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift, for example.\n\nIn the United States, creationists often use the term \"Darwinism\" as a pejorative term in reference to beliefs such as scientific materialism, but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, with evolution by natural selection.\n\nWhile the term \"Darwinism\" had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species\" was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the \"Westminster Review\". Having hailed the book as \"a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism\" promoting scientific naturalism over theology, and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species, Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of Nicolaus Copernicus in explaining planetary motion:\nThese are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:\n\nBULLET::::1. More individuals are produced each generation than can survive.\nBULLET::::2. Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.\nBULLET::::3. Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.\nBULLET::::4. When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.\n\nAnother important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist Peter Kropotkin who, in his book \"\" (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and sociological arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce competition as the core of evolution, which provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:\n\n\"Darwinism\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \"survival of the fittest\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck than to that of Darwin, and predated the publication of Darwin's theory in 1859. What is now called \"Social Darwinism\" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"—the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti-philanthropic political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton, was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable—the foundation of eugenics.\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism\", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and Ernst Haeckel developed what was known as \"Darwinismus\" in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution\", Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection. In 1886, Alfred Russel Wallace went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called \"Darwinism\" without any problems.\n\nIn his book \"Darwinism\" (1889), Wallace had used the term \"pure-Darwinism\" which proposed a \"greater efficacy\" for natural selection. George Romanes dubbed this view as \"Wallaceism\", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a \"pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory.\" Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist. Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.\n\nThe term \"Darwinism\" is often used in the United States by promoters of creationism, notably by leading members of the intelligent design movement, as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an \"ism\") of philosophical naturalism, or atheism. For example, in 1993, UC Berkeley law professor and author Phillip E. Johnson made this accusation of atheism with reference to Charles Hodge's 1874 book \"What Is Darwinism?\". However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist Asa Gray who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: \"It is Atheism.\" Darwinism is an attempt to explain \"design without a designer\", according to evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala.\n\nCreationists use pejoratively the term \"Darwinism\" to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as dogmatic and inflexible in their belief. In the 2008 documentary film \"\", which promotes intelligent design (ID), American writer and actor Ben Stein refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for \"Scientific American\", John Rennie says \"The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to Marxism.\" \n\nHowever, \"Darwinism\" is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is sometimes called \"neo-Darwinism\", from those first proposed by Darwin. \"Darwinism\" also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, \"Darwinism\" may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the history of evolutionary thought—particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.\n\nIn political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. \"It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like 'Maoism,'\" says Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson. He adds, \"Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British atheist Richard Dawkins wrote in his collection of essays \"A Devil's Chaplain\", published in 2003, that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.\n\nIn his 1995 book \"Darwinian Fairytales\", Australian philosopher David Stove used the term \"Darwinism\" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some \"Ultra-Darwinists.\" Stove alleged that by using weak or false \"ad hoc\" reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid: for example, Stove suggested that the sociobiological explanation of altruism as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism. English philosopher Simon Blackburn wrote a rejoinder to Stove, though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegé James Franklin suggested that Blackburn's response actually \"confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything.\"\n\nIn evolutionary aesthetics theory, there is evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by natural selection and therefore Darwinian; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.\n\nBULLET::::- Darwin Awards\nBULLET::::- History of evolutionary thought\nBULLET::::- Modern evolutionary synthesis\nBULLET::::- Neural Darwinism\nBULLET::::- Pangenesis—Charles Darwin's hypothetical mechanism for heredity\nBULLET::::- Speciation\nBULLET::::- Universal Darwinism\nBULLET::::- Retrieved 2015-11-17.\nBULLET::::- Danilevsky, Nikolay. 1885-1889 \"Darwinism: A Critical Study\" (Дарвинизм.

{"id": "8412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8412", "title": "Doraemon", "text": "Doraemon\n\nDoraemon ( ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of the duo Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The series has also been adapted into a successful anime series and media franchise. The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named .\n\nThe first full story in the Doraemon manga series was published in January 1970. A pre-advertisement for the manga was published in six different magazines in December 1969. A total of 1,465 stories were created in the original series, which are published by Shogakukan. It is one of the best-selling manga in the world, and has sold over 100 million copies .\n\nThe volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. Turner Broadcasting System bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States, but cancelled it without explanation before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013, Voyager Japan announced the manga would be released digitally in English via the Amazon Kindle e-book service.\n\nAwards for Doraemon include the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for excellence in 1973, the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982, and the first Osamu Tezuka Culture Award in 1997. In March 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed Doraemon as the nation's first \"anime ambassador.\" A Ministry spokesperson explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. In India, its Hindi, Telugu and Tamil translation has been telecasted, where the anime version is the highest-rated kids' show; winning the \"Best Show For Kids\" award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards India in 2013 and 2015. In 2002 \"Time Asia\" magazine acclaimed the character as an \"Asian Hero\" in a special feature survey. An edited English dub distributed by TV Asahi aired on Disney XD in the United States started on July 7, 2014. On August 17, 2015, another English dubbed version distributed by Luk Internacional began broadcasting on Boomerang UK. The film series is the largest by number of admissions in Japan.\n\nDoraemon, a cat robot from the 22nd century, is sent by Sewashi Nobi to help Nobita Nobi, a young boy who scores poor grades and is frequently bullied by his two classmates, Gian and Suneo so that his descendants can improve their lives. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores unexpected gadgets that improve his life. He has many gadgets, which he gets from The Future Department Store, such as Bamboo-Copter, a small piece of headgear that can allow its users to fly; Anywhere Door, a pink-colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob; Time Kerchief, a handkerchief that can turn an object new or old or a person young or old; Translator Tool, a cuboid jelly that can allow people to converse in any language across the universe; Designer Camera, a camera that produces dresses; and many more.\n\nNobita's closest friend is Shizuka Minamoto, who eventually becomes his wife in the future and has a child with him named Nobisuke Nobi (the same name as Nobita's father). Nobita is often bullied by Takeshi Goda (nicknamed \"Giant\"), and Suneo Honekawa, but they are shown to be friends in some of the episodes. In most episodes, a typical story consists of Nobita taking a gadget from Doraemon for his needs eventually causing more trouble than he was trying to solve. As for the movies, Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Suneo, and Giant (and sometimes Dekisugi) are often shown ready for an adventure to protect people. They are adventurous, humorous, and emotional.\n\nIn December 1969 the \"Doraemon\" manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by Shogakukan. The magazines were aimed at children from nursery school to fourth grade. In 1977 \"CoroCoro Comic\" was launched as the flagship magazine of \"Doraemon.\"\n\nSince the debut of \"Doraemon\" in 1969, the stories have been selectively collected into forty-five tankōbon volumes, which were published under Shogakukan's \"Tentōmushi Comics\" imprint, from 1974 to 1996. Shogakukan published a \"master works\" collection consisting of twenty volumes between July 24, 2009 and September 25, 2012.\n\nIn addition, Doraemon has appeared in a variety of manga series by Shōgakukan. In 2005 Shōgakukan published a series of five more manga volumes under the title \"Doraemon+\" (\"Doraemon Plus\"), which were not found in the forty-five original volumes. On December 1, 2014, a sixth volume of \"Doraemon Plus\" was published. This was the first volume in eight years.\n\nThere have been two series of bilingual, Japanese and English, volumes of the manga by SHOGAKUKAN ENGLISH COMICS under the title \"Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future\", and two audio versions. The first series has ten volumes and the second six. In addition, 21st Century Publishing House (二十一世纪出版社集团) released bilingual English-Chinese versions in Mainland China.\n\nIn July 2013, Fujiko Fujio Productions announced that they would be collaborating with ebook publisher Voyager Japan and localization company AltJapan Co., Ltd. to release an English language version of the manga in full-color digitally via the Amazon Kindle platform in North America. Shogakukan released the first volume in November 2013. This English version incorporates a variety of changes to character names; Nobita is \"Noby\", Shizuka is \"Sue\", Suneo is \"Sneech\", and Gian is \"Big G\", while dorayaki is \"Yummy Bun/Fudgy Pudgy Pie.\" A total of 200 volumes have been released.\n\nThe manga has been published in English in print by Shogakukan Asia, using the same translation as the manga available on Amazon Kindle. Unlike the Amazon Kindle releases these volumes are in black and white instead of color. They have released four volumes.\n\nShogakukan started digital distribution of all forty-five original volumes throughout Japan from July 16, 2015.\n\nAfter a brief first attempt at an animated series in 1973 by Nippon Television, \"Doraemon\" remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when a newly formed animation studio, Shin-Ei Animation (now owned by TV Asahi) produced an animated second attempt of \"Doraemon.\" This series became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,787 episodes on March 25, 2005. In Asia, this version is sometimes referred to as the Ōyama Edition, after the voice actress who voiced Doraemon in this series.\n\nCelebrating the anniversary of the franchise, a third \"Doraemon\" animated series began airing on TV Asahi on April 15, 2005 with new voice actors and staff, and updated character designs. This version is sometimes referred to in Asia as the Mizuta Edition, as Wasabi Mizuta is the voice actress for Doraemon in this series.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, TV Asahi Corporation announced an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to beginning in the summer of that year. Besides using the name changes that were used in AltJapan's English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits have also been made to make the show more relatable to an American audience, such as Japanese text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, items such as yen notes being replaced by US dollar bills, and the setting being changed from Japan to the United States. Confirmed cast member of the new American adaptation include veteran anime voice actress Mona Marshall of \"South Park\" fame in the title role of Doraemon and Johnny Yong Bosch of \"Power Rangers\" and \"Bleach\" fame as Noby. The English dub is produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. Initial response to the edited dub was positive. The Disney adaptation began broadcast in Japan on Disney Channel from February 1, 2016. The broadcast offered the choice of the English voice track or a newly recorded Japanese track by the US cast.\n\nIn EMEA regions, the series is licensed by LUK International. The series began broadcast in the United Kingdom on August 17, 2015 on Boomerang.\n\nIn 1980, Toho released the first of a series of annual feature-length animated films based on the lengthy special volumes published annually. Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a shōnen demographic, taking the familiar characters of \"Doraemon\" and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the dinosaurs, the far reaches of the galaxy, the depths of the ocean, and a world of magic. Some of the films are based on legends such as Atlantis, and on literary works including \"Journey to the West\" and \"Arabian Nights.\" Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.\n\nThere are 63 Japanese-only Doraemon video games, ranging from platformer games to RPG games, beginning with the Emerson's Arcadia 2001 system. Doraemon can also be seen in Namco's popular \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" rhythm game series like \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" (11 – 14 only), \"\", \"Taiko no Tatsujin Wii\", \"Taiko no Tatsujin Plus\", and \"\". The Japanese version of Microsoft's \"3D Movie Maker\" contained a Doraemon-themed expansion pack. The first Doraemon game to receive a Western release was \"Doraemon Story of Seasons\" (2019).\n\n was a 2008 musical based on the 1990 anime film . It debuted at Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space on September 4, 2008 running through September 14. Wasabi Mizuta voiced Doraemon.\n\nThe \"Doraemon \" franchise has had numerous licensed merchandise. In 1999, \"Doraemon\" licensed merchandise sold in Japan, where it was the fifth highest-grossing franchise annually. \"Doraemon\" licensed merchandise in Japan later sold in 2000, in 2001, in 2003, during 20042008, and during 20102012, adding up to at least () licensed merchandise sales in Japan by 2012. Global retail sales of \"Doraemon\" licensed merchandise later generated in 2015, and in 2016. , \"Doraemon\" has generated at least in licensed merchandise sales.\n\nUntil 2015, more than 100million tankobon copies of the manga have been sold, and the anime series is available in over 30 countries. The \"Doraemon\" film series sold more than 103million tickets at the Japanese box office by 2015, surpassing \"Godzilla\" as the highest-grossing film franchise in Japan, and the films grossed over at the worldwide box office, making \"Doraemon\" the highest-grossing anime film franchise.\n\nDoraemon was awarded the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982. In 1997, it was awarded the first Osamu Tezuka Culture Award. In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Doraemon as the first anime cultural ambassador.\n\nOn 22 April 2002, on the special issue of \"Asian Hero\" in \"Time\" magazine, Doraemon was selected as one of the 22 Asian Heroes. Being the only anime character selected, Doraemon was described as \"The Cuddliest Hero in Asia\". In 2005, the Taiwan Society of New York selected \"Doraemon\" as a culturally significant work of Japanese otaku pop-culture in its exhibit \"Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture\", curated by renowned artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nJason Thompson praised the \"silly situations\" and \"old fashioned, simple artwork\", with Doraemon's expression and comments adding to the \"surrounding elementary-school mischief\".\n\nOn September 3, 2012, Doraemon was granted official residence in the city of Kawasaki, one hundred years before he was born.\n\nWith the 2013 film, \"\", Doraemon has surpassed Godzilla in terms of overall ticket sales for a film franchise as Toho's most lucrative movie property. The 33-year series (1980–2013) has sold a combined 100 million tickets vs. the 50-year Godzilla series (1954–2004), which sold a combined 99 million tickets. It also became the largest franchise by numbers of admissions in Japan.\n\nThe \"Doraemon\" anime series is India's highest-rated children's television show , with a total of 478.5million viewers across Hungama TV and Disney Channel India. \"Doraemon\" is similarly popular in neighbouring Pakistan, where the Hindi-dubbed version is aired (Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible). Its popularity has led to controversy in both countries. In 2016, politicians and conservative activists in both India and Pakistan campaigned to ban the show from television because they claimed it \"corrupts children.\" In India, legal notices were served against several companies in India, targeting \"Doraemon\" and \"Crayon Shin-chan\", as having an adverse effect on children.The Government of Bangladesh banned the Indian feeds of Disney Channel and Disney XD in February 2013 as the show \"Doraemon\" was being broadcast continuously throughout the day in Hindi In Pakistan, \"Doraemon\" was targeted by the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf as having a negative impact on children, because of Nobita's constant reliance on Doraemon's gadgets to solve problems, and they attempted to ban 24 hour cartoon channels in general, because of their supposed ruining of children's minds. They also attempted to ban the Hindi dub of the series, as Pakistan's official language is Urdu. \n\nA Fujiko F. Fujio museum opened in Kawasaki on September 3, 2011, featuring Doraemon as the star of the museum.\n\nAs one of the oldest, continuously running icons, Doraemon is a recognizable character in this contemporary generation. Nobita, the show's protagonist, is a break from other characters typically portrayed as special or extraordinary, and this portrayal has been seen as reasons of its appeal as well as the contrary, especially in the United States. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro considers \"Doraemon\" to be \"the greatest kids series ever created\".\n\nESP Guitars have made several Doraemon guitars aimed at children.\n\nIn late 2011, Shogakukan and Toyota joined forces to create a series of live-action commercials as part of Toyota's ReBorn ad campaign. The commercials depict the characters nearly 20 years older. Hollywood actor Jean Reno plays Doraemon.\n\nDoraemon has become a prevalent part of popular culture in Japan. Newspapers also regularly make references to Doraemon and his pocket as something with the ability to satisfy all wishes. The series is frequently referenced in other series such as \"Gin Tama\" and \"Great Teacher Onizuka\".\n\nDoraemon appears in appeals for charity. TV Asahi launched the \"Doraemon Fund\" charity fund to raise money for natural disasters.\n\nDoraemon, Nobita, and the other characters also appear in various educational manga.\n\nDoraemon appeared in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to promote the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nBULLET::::- List of non-Japanese Doraemon versions\nBULLET::::- \"Doraemon\" in India\nBULLET::::- \"Doraemon\" in Vietnam\nBULLET::::- \"Dorabase\", a spin-off about robot cats who can play in a baseball team.\nBULLET::::- \"Ninja Hattori-kun\"\nBULLET::::- \"21 Emon\", a manga by Fujiko F.

{"id": "8414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8414", "title": "Dartmoor Preservation Association", "text": "Dartmoor Preservation Association\n\nDartmoor Preservation Association (DPA) is one of the oldest environmental or amenity bodies in the UK. It was founded in 1883. It concerns itself with Dartmoor, a National Park in Devon, south-west England. It began with two main areas of concern. Firstly, commoners’ rights were being eroded through army use, including the firing of live artillery shells, and piecemeal enclosure of land around the margins. Secondly, there was increasing public interest in Dartmoor's scenery, archaeology, history and wildlife\n\nThe DPA has opposed what it considered to be unsuitable developments on Dartmoor throughout its history. In its founding year, the secretary, Robert Burnard persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays to allow access to the public. Many battles have been fought since, particularly against the military presence and the proposed building of reservoirs on the moor, notably under the Chairmanship of Lady Sayer, granddaughter of Robert Burnard.\n\nThe DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. For example, in June 2015, it supported the inhabitants of Widecombe-in-the-Moor against the erecting of a telecommunications mast in an area of pristine countryside against the wishes of the local population.\n\nDartmoor Preservation Association is a registered charity, Number 215665.\n\nDartmoor is said to be one of the last remaining areas of wilderness in Britain, but it has been a managed landscape since the late Neolithic (3,000-2,500 BCE). The Bronze Age inhabitants (from 2,500 to 750 BCE) cleared ancient forest and developed farming. They made extensive use of surface moorstone in the construction of roundhouses (their remains now seen as \"hut circles\"), enclosures, land-dividing reaves, stone rows, stone circles, menhirs and kistvaens.\n\nFarming has continued through the Medieval period to the present day, but a more disruptive activity to the landscape was the appearance of tin-mining, firstly by stream-working, then by lode-working and finally by underground mining. Many valleys have been dug over and scarred, leaving a rich industrial archaeology. Other activities such as newtake wall building, peat cutting, rabbit warrening, quarrying, clay extraction and the building of a prominent prison have all left marks on the moor. Recent undertakings have left more obvious changes: the building of reservoirs and the planting of conifer forests.\n\nThe use of moorstone continued up to recent times with the extensive building of dry stone walls around farm newtakes. Later, stone was cut and dressed. The use of moorstone continued to such an extent that in 1847 boundary markers were cut around Pew Tor to protect it. Marker stones were erected around Roos Tor. The taking of stone started to change the Dartmoor landscape: for example Eric Hemery (writing in 1983) stated that Swell Tor had been \"decapitated and disembowelled by the quarrymen\".\n\nIn August 1881, a public meeting was convened by the Portreeve of Tavistock in the Guildhall to discuss the continued taking of stone, particularly from landmark tors. The DPA was founded in 1883. The protected area around Pew Tor was extended in December 1896. In 1901, the DPA commissioned a report into damage to ancient monuments, caused by the taking of stone for building and road-mending, and into unlawful enclosures of common land.\n\nThe first publication of the DPA, in 1890, was a short history of commoners’ rights on Dartmoor and the commons of Devon. This notes a decrease in the numbers of animals even in medieval times: in 1296 – 5,000 cattle, 487 horses, 131 folds of sheep; in 1316 – 3,292 cattle, 368 horses, 100 folds of sheep. \"An important battle occurred in 1894 when the Corporation of London attempted to buy the whole of Dartmoor in order to pipe its water to Paddington alongside Brunel’s recently converted railway, when it went from broad gauge to standard gauge. The DPA led the revolt against this\". In 1897, the DPA went to court to fight successfully the enclosure of a section of Peter Tavy Great Common, in support of a farmer. Commoners rights seem to have been a settled issue in recent years: except for where they are impinged upon by the military presence.\n\nDartmoor Training Area has been used regularly for military training since 1873, although it was used earlier during the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars. In 1906-07, seven miles of roads were built on the north moor to facilitate the movement of guns. There are three established firing ranges at Okehampton, Willsworthy and Merrivale. The area taken up with live firing ranges is 9,187 hectares (22,664 acres) and they are used on average 120 days each year. They are used for small arms, mortars and artillery smoke and illuminating shells.\n\nThe use of the moor by the military has been a major concern of the DPA since its founding. In its first year, Robert Burnard (DPA Secretary) persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays so that there may be some public access to the area. Lady Sylvia Sayer was very outspoken about it being totally at odds with the area being designated as a National Park. In 1963 the DPA published a widely circulated 24-page booklet entitled \"Misuse of a National Park\" which includes photographs of unexploded shells lying on the open moor, corrugated iron buildings, large craters, a derelict tank used as a target, bullet marks on standing stones, etc. It also contains details of a 1958 incident in which a young boy was killed by a mortar shell near Cranmere Pool.\n\nSince the 1960s there has been much less military damage and litter as a result of the DPA persuading the Services to be more cautious. The military have changed since the Victorian era, they now have 120 conservation groups across the Ministry of Defence (MOD), including Dartmoor Military Conservation Group. The current leases run for many years, with Cramber Tor most recently being granted a further 40-year licence.\n\nEarly afforestation occurred when Brimpts was planted with trees in 1862. The Forestry Commission was founded in 1919, following World War I and in that year the Duchy of Cornwall planted 800 acres of conifers at Fernworthy. In 1921, Plymouth Corporation planted conifers around Burrator Reservoir. The Forestry Commission planted Bellever and Laughter Tor farms in 1930-32 and in 1944-1945 Soussons Down was also planted. The DPA opposed these post-war plantings and R. Hansford Worth (1868-1950, a Plymouth engineer, scientist and antiquarian) delivered a lecture fiercely critical of the Duchy of Cornwall as the landowners at The Plymouth Athenaeum, using the argument of encroachment on the rights of common and loss of ancient monuments. DPA opposition to forestry on Dartmoor arose again in 1953 when it wrote a policy on woodlands in the then-new national park. Opposition was exercised when Hawn, Dendles and High House Wastes, all near Cornwood, were designated for tree planting in 1959. Argument continued while Hawns and Dendles Wastes were ploughed in 1960. High House Waste was purchased by the DPA in 1964 and the Nature Conservancy (UK) bought neighbouring Dendles in 1965. The situation in 2015 is that some of the Dartmoor plantations have been affected by the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum which results in widespread clear felling to prevent further spread of the disease. The policy now is to replant with more native hardwood trees although more resistant conifers are also being used.\n\nThere are eight Dartmoor reservoirs, with the earliest being Tottiford Reservoir, 1861. Three were built in the mid-20th century: Fernworthy, 1942; Avon, 1957 and Meldon, 1972, and the DPA fought many battles over these. It opposed plans for reservoirs on Brent Moor (1899) and Holne Moor (1901) where, later, the Avon Reservoir and Venford Reservoirs were respectively built. The DPA's opposition was supported in the House of Commons with argument made regarding the effects on the local water table. The DPA was one of many local and national amenity bodies that fought the building of the Meldon dam. The preservation battle for the Meldon valley was recorded in a DPA publication. The DPA offered a viable alternative site, Gorhuish Valley, for various reasons, including the fact that minerals such as arsenic would leach into the water supply if Meldon were selected. The Meldon story was discussed many times in Parliament. Another battle was fought against the flooding of the Swincombe valley to form another reservoir. This was rejected in parliament in 1970, revived in 1974 and finally resolved by the building of the Roadford Reservoir to the west of the moor. In 1985 the DPA used funds from a bequest to purchase 50 acres of land where the dam of a reservoir at Swincombe would have to be.\n\nThe National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 led to Dartmoor being one of the first four parks to be designated, by an order made on 15 August 1951 and confirmed on 30 October 1951. Shortly after this, the DPA tried to ensure that the new National Park was run by an independent committee and not by the Dartmoor Standing Committee that was a subcommittee of Devon County Council Planning Committee. The committee was reformed as Dartmoor National Park Committee under the Local Government Act 1972 but it was still a subcommittee of Devon County Council and as such it was not seen to be an independent guardian of the moor by the DPA. It was not until 1997 that an independent Dartmoor National Park Authority was enabled under the Environment Act 1995 as a free-standing local authority, forty-four years after the park was created, although it is still dominated by local authorities and government appointees.\n\nThe DPA learned in October 1951 that the BBC planned to build a 750-foot television mast on North Hessary Tor, near Princetown, that was erected in 1955. This was to be a relay from a transmitting station at Wenvoe, South Wales. The DPA objected to this threat and sought expert opinion, offered alternative solutions, pressed for a public enquiry, engaged a lawyer, held public meetings, distributed pamphlets, wrote to the press and petitioned parliament. Eventually, a public enquiry was announced. When the decision was made to permit the mast, there were a number of conditions, included among them was that the development was built near the tor, leaving it still intact, and that its new approach road should not be fenced. During the process of obtaining land for the transmitter, one MP asked in the House of Commons: \"Will the Assistant Postmaster-General bear in mind that we have no desire to hinder the provision of this station but that it is felt that ancient common rights such as these, that have existed for a thousand years, should be adequately protected or properly extinguished by due process of law?\"\n\nDuring World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) built a mast and buildings on Peek Hill, as RAF Sharpitor. In 1956, permission was granted to rebuild the station as part of the \"Gee\" radio navigation system, to be occupied for ten years. There followed delay in leaving and a proposal was made in 1970 by Devon & Cornwall Police to use the mast, which was rejected. Then later that year Plymouth Corporation wanted to use the exposed site for housing juvenile offenders. This was also rejected, but Plymouth appealed. At a public enquiry in June 1973 Lady Sylvia Sayer represented the DPA and permission for development on the site was refused. A few years later, DPA fought successfully in support of South West Water (SWW) against renewed calls for a new reservoir at Swincombe. To mark the victory, Sylvia Sayer asked SWW if DPA could purchase the rocky outcrop of Sharpitor. The DPA purchased 32 acres in February 1984.\n\nOkehampton lies on the A30 main road, the shortest route from London to west Devon and Cornwall. The need for a bypass was mooted in 1963. In 1975, three routes were considered: a northern route through mainly farmland, a central route using a railway, and a southern route through Dartmoor National Park. In August 1976, the Department of the Environment announced the preferred route was through the National Park. A major event on the timeline of this project was a 96-day public enquiry from 1 May 1979 to 4 February 1980 held in Okehampton. In March 1984, the DPA with other organisations petitioned Parliament opposing compulsory purchase orders on public open spaces. The Secretary of State announced in July 1985 that he was introducing a bill to reverse the decision of a Joint Parliamentary Committee and confirm a route through the National Park. This was followed by a confirmation bill in November 1985 that was passed in the House of Lords on 5 December 1985. Construction started in November 1986 and the road was opened on 19 July 1988.\n\nThe DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. The activities have widened, involving local partners, it has a calendar of events, walks and work days with its Conservation Team undertaking a variety of moorland projects, it funds the supply of walking boots to some children who need them for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme through the Moor Boots Scheme, it collaborates with the Campaign for National Parks, it monitors the activities of Dartmoor National Park Authority who run the National Park. It objected to eight planning proposals (with success in seven cases), with many other achievements in the DPA Director's Annual Report. The DPA remains true to its original objectives and has also added other activities in support of Dartmoor and its inhabitants.\n\nThe china clay industry on Dartmoor was established long before the DPA was founded. The earliest record of a china clay pit refers to Hook Lake in 1502. The area was surveyed around 1827 by Cornishmen with thirty years experience in the clay industry. They obtained a 21-year lease in 1830, from the Earl of Morley who owned the land, to work the area between Lee Moor and Shaugh Moor. A rival pit was opened at Leftlake in about 1850 and at Hemerdon and Broomage in about 1855. Further pits were opened at Cholwichtown, Whitehill Yeo and Wigford Down/Brisworthy (circa 1860). Others followed at Smallhanger and Headon in the 1870s. Redlake started working in 1910. China clay pits are open cast mines that result in large holes in the ground accompanied by large waste tips. Over time, the pits become larger and more ground is needed for the waste, changing the landscape: the effect of this can be seen from space.\n\nThe DPA argues that this is an activity that does not agree with the ethos of a National Park, whose purpose is to protect landscape from unsuitable development. In 1994, the National Park boundaries were changed to include common land at Shaugh Moor and exclude china clay worked land at Lee Moor. The DPA revived its campaign with the publication of a booklet in 1999 when the Blackabrook Valley, Crownhill Down and Shaugh Moor, near the popular tourist area of Cadover Bridge, all came under threat from exploitation or dumping of waste. The china clay companies relinquished planning permissions in 2001. However, in November 2009, the clay companies, Sibelco and Imerys, produced a report reviewing old mineral permissions under the Environment Act 1995 with a view to joining up two pits. A presumed Bronze Age barrow, known as Emmets Post, was to be removed and three other monuments may be affected. The DPA were recorded twice, with other bodies, in a Devon County Council Development Management Committee Report for their representations in securing the future of the three areas where planning permissions were relinquished in 2001. Oxford Archaeology held an open day during their excavation of Emmets Post in 2014 prior to its removal.\n\nThe DPA and Exmoor Society held a joint reception at the House of Lords on 6 November 2008, hosted by Baroness Mallalieu, to lobby members of both Houses of Parliament and relevant Ministers about ensuring that environmental schemes for the uplands are \"fit for purpose\". Both organisations funded an invited number of upland hill farmers to attend.\n\nThe excavation in August 2011 on the north moor of a Bronze Age burial kistvaen, or cist, that was originally uncovered in 2001 was part-funded by the DPA, along with other bodies.\n\nA conference for the upland farmers of Bodmin Moor, Exmoor and Dartmoor was held as a joint venture between the South West Uplands Federation and the DPA. It was run by the DPA at Exeter Racecourse in October 2012, with 150 delegates. Speakers came from the Foundation for Common Land, the Forest of Dartmoor Commoners, the University of Gloucestershire, the National Farmers Union of England and Wales and the Open Spaces Society. The CEO raised sponsorship from Dartmoor National Park, Exmoor National Park, Natural England, Duchy of Cornwall and the Exmoor Society - this reflecting the standing of the DPA with those bodies.\n\nTwo major projects to underground overhead power cables in Dartmoor National Park have been completed in a joint project between Western Power Distribution, the South West Protected Landscapes Forum (SWPLF) and Dartmoor National Park Authority. The two schemes on Holne Moor and Walkhampton Common between them remove nearly 6 km of overhead line from open moorland. At nearly 5 km, the Walkhampton scheme is the largest to be undertaken in the South West region by Western Power Distribution. The old overhead line was readily visible from the B3212 Princetown to Yelverton Road, strung across Walkhampton Common from Devil's Elbow to just above Horseyeatt at Peek Hill. The works to provide the new underground supply were mainly undertaken on the highway to minimise the impact on the sensitive moorland landscape, its archaeology, wildlife and livestock. The DPA has supported the undergrounding of these visually intrusive power lines for many years.\n\nThe Dartmoor Conservation Garden is a joint project between DPA and Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) and is located in the Jack Wigmore Garden behind the High Moorland Centre in Princetown: this is a memorial garden to a former Chair of the Authority. It is planted with a cross-section of typical native Dartmoor plants. It also houses some typical Dartmoor archaeological features, such as a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age burial kistvaen (or cist) and a Medieval granite cross from Ter Hill. This marked the Monk's Path but was constantly being pushed over by cattle. The purpose of the Garden is to illustrate the biodiversity on Dartmoor. The project came online in June 2015.\n\nThe DPA were involved in a campaign in June 2015 against four telecommunications masts planned for Dartmoor, with the first to be erected in the village of Widecombe. At short notice, the DPA banners were taken out, letters written, press interviews given and support given to the villagers when an inflatable mast was demonstrated – with the effect that the planning application was withdrawn.\n\nIn common with other amenity bodies, such as those for the Lake District, Peak District, Pembrokeshire Coast, Yorkshire Dales Three Peaks and the New Forest Trust, the image of Dartmoor Preservation Association is evolving from its Victorian origins, although the original name is being retained. Friends of Dartmoor projects a more modern image of preservation where several years of diplomacy have achieved good relations with the partner agencies that operate in the Dartmoor arena. This is due mainly to the efforts of the previous CEO, James Paxman and his successor, Phil Hutt.\n\nThe DPA Constitution, objectives and policies are published on the DPA web site.\n\nThe objectives enshrined in the constitution are the protection, preservation and enhancement in the public interest of the landscape, antiquities, flora and fauna, natural beauty, cultural heritage and scientific interest of Dartmoor. Also the protection and preservation of public access to and on Dartmoor subject to the ancient rights of commoners. Co-operation with the commoners and any organisation in achieving DPA objectives, also the study of and the recording and publication of information upon the antiquities, history and natural history of Dartmoor. There is also an interest in the acquisition of land and rights to further DPA objectives, concomitant with being a charity.\n\nThe DPA has twenty-two policies listed on its web site: regarding access and rights of way, fencing, protecting monuments, diverse habitats, bracken, china clay quarrying, military training and live firing, hill farming and small scale traditional local industries, quarrying, television and telephone masts, wind farms, planning applications, housing developments, woodlands and forestry, ponies, swaling, and recreational activities.\n\nThe DPA logo incorporates a representation of a Dartmoor rock feature known as Bowerman's Nose. The logo that includes a representation of Nun's Cross appeared on the DPA Dartmoor Newsletter No. 48, October 1966, with a comment that designs based on the initial letters DPA had been exhausted. The simpler logo appeared in November 1969, when Newsletter 52 carried the logo with \"DPA\" on it. This was replaced in 2004 with the multicoloured logo.\n\nBULLET::::- Brewer, Dave. \"Dartmoor Boundary Markers\". Halsgrove.

{"id": "8418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8418", "title": "Dartmouth College", "text": "Dartmouth College\n\nDartmouth College ( ) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is the ninth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although founded as a school to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, Dartmouth primarily trained Congregationalist ministers throughout its early history before it gradually secularized, emerging at the turn of the 20th century from relative obscurity into national prominence.\n\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, the university provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs including 57 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs. Dartmouth comprises five constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, the Rockefeller Institute for Public Policy, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,400, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of 7.9% for the Class of 2023.\n\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's 269-acre main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England. The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, strong Greek culture, and wide array of enduring campus traditions. Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I.\n\nDartmouth is consistently included among the highest-ranked universities in the United States by several institutional rankings, and has been cited as a leading university for undergraduate teaching and research by \"U.S. News & World Report\". In 2018, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education listed Dartmouth as the only \"majority-undergraduate\", \"arts-and-sciences focused\", \"doctoral university\" in the country that has \"some graduate coexistence\" and \"very high research activity\".\n\nIn its history, the university has produced many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, 24 U.S. governors, 10 billionaire alumni, 10 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 79 Rhodes Scholars, 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients, 13 Pulitzer Prize winners, and numerous MacArthur Genius fellows, Fulbright Scholars, CEOs and founders of Fortune 500 corporations, high-ranking U.S. diplomats, scholars in academia, literary and media figures, professional athletes, and Olympic medalists.\n\nDartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Columbia, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.\n\nWheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755. The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by Dr. John Phillips in 1762, who would go on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock. The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\nAlthough the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the College. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing & all parts of Learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing Children of Pagans as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences and also of English Youth and any others\". The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth—an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the College and never donated to it—Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under Colonial rule. The College granted its first degrees in 1771.\n\nGiven the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites. Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.\n\nIn 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college' charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby. Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the College's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"\n\nDartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school. and Dartmouth \"was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated\". One of them, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.\n\nIn 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.\n\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded. Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893–1909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux. 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige. Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909–16) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916–45) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s. In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university. John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations. During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.\n\nIn 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth. Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy. At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities. In 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed. The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.3 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008. The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial\", citing \"Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.\n\nSince the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict. President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008 and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009.\n\nIn May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Tübingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).\n\nIn early August 2019, Dartmouth College agreed to pay nine current and former students a total of $14 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by three former neuroscience professors.\n\nIn 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU).\n\nDartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students. The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors. For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history. The Government Department, whose prominent professors include Stephen Brooks, Richard Ned Lebow, and William Wohlforth, was ranked the top solely undergraduate political science program in the world by researchers at the London School of Economics in 2003. The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower and Andrew Samwick, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world.\n\nIn order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program. Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten \"distributive requirements\" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing. Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in \"independent, sustained work\", culminating in the production of a thesis. In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.\n\nThrough the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts & Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s. Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)—which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences—and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of \"Dartmouth University\"; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as \"Dartmouth College v. Woodward\"), the school uses the name \"Dartmouth College\" to refer to the entire institution.\n\nDartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities. Faculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.\n\nDartmouth serves as the host institution of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that is supported by a consortium of schools that also includes Brandeis University, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern University, Tufts University and the University of Vermont.\n\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" \nUSNWR graduate school rankings\n\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\" \nUSNWR departmental rankings\n\nDartmouth was ranked tied for 12th among undergraduate programs at national universities by \"U.S. News & World Report\" in its 2020 rankings. \"U.S. News\" also ranked the school 2nd best for veterans, tied for 5th best in undergraduate teaching, and 9th for \"best value\" at national universities in 2020.\n\nThe 2018 Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked Dartmouth among the 70-95th best universities in the nation.\n\nIn \"Forbes\" 2019 rankings of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies, Dartmouth ranked 10th overall and 10th in research universities. In the \"Forbes\" 2018 \"grateful graduate\" rankings, Dartmouth came in first for the second year in a row.\n\nThe 2006 Carnegie Foundation classification listed Dartmouth as the only \"majority-undergraduate\", \"arts-and-sciences focus[ed]\", \"research university\" in the country that also had \"some graduate coexistence\" and \"very high research activity\".\n\n+ Enrolled fall freshman statistics\n!   \n!2019!! 2018 !! 2017 !! 2016 !! 2015 !! 2014\n23,650\n1,876\n7.9%\n1,193\n1440-1560\n32-35\nUndergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and \"U.S. News & World Report\" as \"most selective\". The \"Princeton Review\", in its 2018 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 98 out of 99.\n\nFor the freshman class entering Fall 2019, Dartmouth received 23,650 applications of which 1,876 were accepted for an 7.9% admissions rate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, a record 46.3% were valedictorian or salutatorian, with 97% ranking in the top decile of their class. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1497, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33. More than 51% identified as being students of color, 15% are among the first generation in their families to matriculate to college, 10% are international students, and 12% are legacies.\n\nAdditionally, for the 2016–2017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85. Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the College, and currently admits all students, with the exception of internationals, on a need-blind basis.\n\nDartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth practices need-blind admissions for all applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and undocumented students in the U.S. These applicants are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. For international students, financial need is taken into consideration as one of many factors at the time of admission. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $100,000 or less and possessing typical assets. In 2015, $88.8 million in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\n\nDartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman and senior years, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year. However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during their freshman, senior, or sophomore summer terms. During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects. The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.\n\nThe D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds\". Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\n\nDartmouth is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising the college president (\"ex officio\"), the state governor (\"ex officio\"), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\"). The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\n\nAlthough the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007, the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees. In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action. In 2008, the Board added five new charter trustees.\n\nDartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its campus is centered on a \"Green\", a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771. Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover, and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million. In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains and a tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.\n\nDartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006. Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style, a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions. The College has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A- from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.\n\nA notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms.\n\nThe college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts (\"the Hop\"). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the College's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty. The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking façade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium. The Hop is also the location of all student mailboxes (\"Hinman boxes\") and the Courtyard Café dining facility. The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation, and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.\nIn addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library. The Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School. The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River. The Thayer School comprises two buildings; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas. The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business & Engineering Library.\n\nDartmouth's nine libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs. Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business & Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Kresge Physical Sciences Library, Paddock Music Library, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002). Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's tower is an iconic symbol of the College.\n\nDartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century. Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus. The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a state of the art fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123 m) indoor track. Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center. Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track. The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink. Also visible from Memorial Field is the Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.\n\nDartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899), and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse. The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire, that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth ski team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.\n\nDartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book \"Passion for Skiing\" as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book \"Passion for Snow\".\n\nBeginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities. Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges. The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites. Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years. More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.\n\nCampus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus. Four of them are located at the center of campus in the Class of 1953 Commons, formerly Thayer Dining Hall.\n\nThe Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the \"student union\" or \"campus center\". It contains a café, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Centre. Robinson Hall, next door to both Collis and Thayer, contains the offices of a number of student organizations including the Dartmouth Outing Club and \"The Dartmouth\" daily newspaper.\n\nIn 2006, \"The Princeton Review\" ranked Dartmouth third in its \"Quality of Life\" category, and sixth for having the \"Happiest Students\". Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities. In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports. The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in \"The Princeton Review\" in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.\n\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. The \"Washington Post\" attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years. In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth College had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner\", compared to 45.5% of students nationally.\n\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.\n\nDartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests. In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 \"issue-oriented\" groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups. Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club, which includes the nationally recognized Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial conservative newspaper \"The Dartmouth Review\"; and \"The Dartmouth\", arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper. \"The Dartmouth\" describes itself as \"America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799\".\n\nPartially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students. Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations. In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year. Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s. In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a Board of Trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become \"substantially coeducational\"; this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed. The fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.\n\nDartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.\n\nThe college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.\n\nApproximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics. In 2007, Dartmouth College fielded 34 intercollegiate varsity teams: 16 for men, 16 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships. In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.\n\nThe college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body. The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014. The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2015. The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008. In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a swim and three terms of physical education.\n\nThe charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Eleazar Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others\". However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Native American named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.\n\nThe college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first two hundred years. In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a \"new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment\". Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.\n\nDartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions. The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as \"big weekends\" or \"party weekends\". In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class. Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges. In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.\n\nThe summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance. The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the College.\n\nAnother longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run Dartmouth Outing Club trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge. In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.\n\nDartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is \"Vox clamantis in deserto\". The Latin motto is literally translated as \"A calling voice in the wilderness\", but is more often rendered as \"A voice crying out in the wilderness\". The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement. Richard Hovey's \"Men of Dartmouth\" was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896, and became the school's official song in 1926. The song was retitled to \"Alma Mater\" in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.\n\nDartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas. The college's founder Eleazar Wheelock designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education. Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone. The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \"1770\" to \"1769\", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use. The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.\n\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a \"Dartmouth College Shield\" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from \"1770\" to \"1769\" around 1958. That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.\n\nCollege designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design. The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of Dartmouth Medical School, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across. The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.\n\nDartmouth has never had an official mascot. The nickname \"The Big Green\", originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (\"Dartmouth Green\") as the school's official color in 1866. Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname \"the Indians\", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists. This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the \"use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education\". Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, \"The Dartmouth Review\", have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence, but never succeeded in doing so.\n\nVarious student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become \"official\". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern\" was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy, the mascot has received approval from only the student government. In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" as a potential replacement amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.\n\nDartmouth's alumni are known for their devotion to the college. Most start by giving to the Senior Class Gift. According to a 2008 article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" based on data from payscale.com, Dartmouth graduates also earn higher median salaries at least 10 years after graduation than alumni of any other American university surveyed.\n\nBy 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields.\n\nNelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated \"cum laude\" from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930. Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster. Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. C. Everett Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan. Two Dartmouth alumni have served as justices on the Supreme Court of the United States: Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury. Eugene Norman Veasey (class of 1954) served as the Chief Justice of Delaware. The 46th Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf; the 42nd Governor of Illinois, businessman Bruce Rauner; and the 31st governor and current senator from North Dakota, John Hoeven (R), are also Dartmouth alumni. Ernesto de la Guardia, class of 1925, was president of the Republic of Panama.\n\nIn literature and journalism, Dartmouth has produced 13 Pulitzer Prize winners: Thomas M. Burton, Richard Eberhart, Dan Fagin, Paul Gigot, Frank Gilroy, Jake Hooker, Nigel Jaquiss, Joseph Rago, Martin J. Sherwin, David K. Shipler, David Shribman, Justin Harvey Smith and Robert Frost. Frost, who received four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry in his lifetime, attended but did not graduate from Dartmouth; he is, however, the only person to have received two honorary degrees from Dartmouth.\n\nOther authors and media personalities include ABC Senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper, novelist and founding editor of \"The Believer\" Heidi Julavits, \"Dean of rock critics\" Robert Christgau, National Book Award winners Louise Erdrich and Phil Klay, novelist/screenwriter Budd Schulberg, political commentator Dinesh D'Souza, radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, commentator Mort Kondracke, and journalist James Panero. Norman Maclean, professor at the University of Chicago and author of \"A River Runs Through It and Other Stories\", graduated from Dartmouth in 1924. Theodor Geisel, better known as children's author Dr. Seuss, was a member of the class of 1925.\n\nIn the area of religion and theology, Dartmouth alumni include priests and ministers Ebenezer Porter, Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Caleb Sprague Henry, Arthur Whipple Jenks, Solomon Spalding, and Joseph Tracy; and rabbis Marshall Meyer, Arnold Resnicoff, and David E. Stern. Hyrum Smith, brother of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, attended the college in his teens. He was Patriarch of the LDS Church.\n\nDartmouth alumni in academia include Stuart Kauffman and Jeffrey Weeks, both recipients of MacArthur Fellowships (commonly called \"genius grants\"). Dartmouth has also graduated three Nobel Prize winners: Owen Chamberlain (Physics, 1959), K. Barry Sharpless (Chemistry, 2001), and George Davis Snell (Physiology or Medicine, 1980). Educators include founder and first president of Bates College Oren Burbank Cheney (1839); the current chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox (PhD. in Chemistry, 1974); founding president of Vassar College Milo Parker Jewett; founder and first president of Kenyon College Philander Chase; first professor of Wabash College Caleb Mills; and president of Union College Charles Augustus Aiken. Nine of Dartmouth's 17 presidents were alumni of the college.\n\nDartmouth alumni serving as CEOs or company presidents and executives include Charles Alfred Pillsbury, founder of the Pillsbury Company and patriarch of the Pillsbury family, Sandy Alderson (San Diego Padres), John Donahoe (eBay), Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. (IBM), Charles E. Haldeman (Putnam Investments), Donald J. Hall Sr. (Hallmark Cards), Douglas Hodge (CEO of PIMCO accused of fraud), Jeffrey R. Immelt (General Electric), Gail Koziara Boudreaux (United Health Care), Grant Tinker (NBC), and Brian Goldner (Hasbro).\n\nIn film, entertainment, and television, Dartmouth is represented by Budd Schulberg, Academy Award-winning screenwriter of \"On the Waterfront\"; Michael Phillips, who won the Academy Award for best picture as co-producer of \"The Sting\"; Rachel Dratch, a cast member of \"Saturday Night Live\"; Shonda Rhimes creator of \"Grey's Anatomy, Private Practice\" and \"Scandal\"; Chris Meledandri, executive producer of \"Ice Age\", \"Horton Hears a Who!\", and \"Despicable Me\"; writer and director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller; and the title character of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", Fred Rogers.

In baseball, Dartmouth alumni include All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner and manager Brad Ausmus, All-Star reliever Mike Remlinger, and pitcher Kyle Hendricks. Professional football players include Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler, linebacker Reggie Williams, three-time Pro Bowler Nick Lowery, quarterback Jeff Kemp, and Tennessee Titans tight end Casey Cramer, plus Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Matt Burke. Dartmouth has also produced a number of Olympic competitors. Adam Nelson won the silver medal in the shot put in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics to go along with his gold medal in the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki. Kristin King and Sarah Parsons were members of the United States' 2006 bronze medal-winning ice hockey team. Cherie Piper, Gillian Apps, and Katie Weatherston were among Canada's ice hockey gold medalists in 2006.\n\nDick Durrance and Tim Caldwell competed for the United States in skiing in the 1936 and 1976 Winter Olympics, respectively. Arthur Shaw, Earl Thomson, Edwin Myers, Marc Wright, Adam Nelson, Gerry Ashworth, and Vilhjálmur Einarsson have all won medals in track and field events. Former heavyweight rower Dominic Seiterle is a member of the Canadian national rowing team and won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the men's 8+ event.\n\nDartmouth College has appeared in or been referenced by a number of popular media. Most notably, the 1978 comedy film \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" was co-written by Chris Miller '63, and is based loosely on a series of stories he wrote about his fraternity days at Dartmouth. In a CNN interview, John Landis said the movie was \"based on Chris Miller's real fraternity at Dartmouth\", Alpha Delta Phi. Dartmouth's Winter Carnival tradition was the subject of the 1939 film \"Winter Carnival\" starring Ann Sheridan and written by Budd Schulberg '36 and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nBULLET::::- Behrens, Richard K., \"From the Connecticut Valley to the West Coast: The Role of Dartmouth College in the Building of the Nation,\" \"Historical New Hampshire,\" 63 (Spring 2009), 45–68.\nBULLET::::- \"(Read and download public domain copy via Google Books.)\"\nBULLET::::- \"Listen, Look, Likeness: examining the portraits of Félix de la Concha\" 2009 ArtsEditor.com article\n\nBULLET::::- Dartmouth Athletics website\n"}
