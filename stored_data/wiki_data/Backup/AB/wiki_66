{"id": "16125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16125", "title": "John the Baptist", "text": "John the Baptist\n\nJohn the Baptist (late 1 century BC – 28–36 AD) was a Hebrew itinerant preacher in the early \"1\" century AD. Other titles for John include \"John the Forerunner\" in Eastern Christianity, \"John the Immerser\" in some Baptist traditions, and \"the prophet John (\"Yaḥyā\")\" in Islam. He is sometimes alternatively called \"John the Baptizer\".\n\nJohn the Baptist is mentioned by the Hebrew historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these faiths, and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself, and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus, since John announces Jesus' coming and prepares the people for Jesus' ministry. Jesus himself identifies John as \"Elijah who is to come\", which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah, although John the Baptist in the Gospel of John explicitly denies being linked to Elijah (John 1:21). According to the New Testament, John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives.\n\nSome scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes, a semi-ascetic Judaic sect who expected a Hebrew messiah and who practiced ritual baptism.\nJohn used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus, and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus' early followers had previously been followers of John.\n\nAccording to the New Testament John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas sometime between 28 and 36 AD after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife, Phasaelis, and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I.\n\nJohn the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is implied in .\n\nThe Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfilment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and Exodus) about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on locusts and wild honey. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him 'like a dove'. A voice from heaven then says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.\" ()\n\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying Herodias, the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.\n\nThe account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias (NRSV; other translations refer to the girl as the \"daughter of Herodias\") dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.()\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this passage. The Gospel refers to Antipas as 'King' and the ex-husband of Herodias is named as Philip, but he is known to have been called Herod. Although the wording clearly implies the girl was the daughter of Herodias, many texts describe her as \"Herod's daughter, Herodias\". Since these texts are early and significant and the reading is 'difficult', many scholars see this as the original version, corrected in later versions and in Matthew and Luke. Josephus says that Herodias had a daughter by the name of Salome.\n\nScholars have speculated about the origins of the story. Since it shows signs of having been composed in Aramaic, which Mark apparently did not speak, he is likely to have got it from a Palestinian source. There are a variety of opinions about how much actual historical material it contains, especially given the alleged factual errors. Many scholars have seen the story of John arrested, executed, and buried in a tomb as a conscious foreshadowing of the fate of Jesus.\n\nBULLET::::- John and his baptism of Jesus (Mark 1)\nAs it is written in Isaiah the prophet,\n\"Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way,\nthe voice of one crying in the wilderness:\nPrepare the way of the Lord,\nmake his paths straight,'\"\n\nJohn appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased.\"\n\nBULLET::::- Death of John (Mark 6)\n\nKing Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\nBut an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified quotation from Isaiah, moving the Malachi and Exodus material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus. The description of John is taken directly from Mark (\"clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey\"), along with the proclamation that one was coming who would baptise with the Holy Spirit \"and fire\".()\n\nUnlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" and a \"coming judgment\".\n\nMatthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples. Matthew's approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus. Where Mark has Herod killing John reluctantly and at Herodias' insistence, Matthew describes him as wanting John dead.\nBULLET::::- John and his baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3)\nIn those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,\n\n\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:\n'Prepare the way of the Lord;\nmake his paths straight.'\"\n\nNow John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n\"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nBULLET::::- John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)\n\nNow when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\nAs they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.'\n\nTruly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n\"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\nBULLET::::- Death of John (Matthew 14)\n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.\n\nThe Gospel of Luke adds an account of John's infancy, introducing him as the miraculous son of Zechariah, an old man, and his wife Elizabeth, who was past menopause and therefore unable to have children. According to this account, the birth of John was foretold by the angel Gabriel to Zechariah, while he was performing his functions as a priest in the temple of Jerusalem. Since he is described as a priest of the course of Abijah and Elizabeth as one of the daughters of Aaron, this would make John a descendant of Aaron on both his father's and mother's side. On the basis of this account, the Catholic as well as the Anglican and Lutheran liturgical calendars placed the feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist on June 24, six months before Christmas.\n\nElizabeth is described as a \"relative\" of Mary, the mother of Jesus in . There is no mention of a family relationship between John and Jesus in the other Gospels, and Raymond E. Brown has described it as \"of dubious historicity\". Géza Vermes has called it \"artificial and undoubtedly Luke's creation\". The many similarities between the Gospel of Luke story of the birth of John and the Old Testament account of the birth of Samuel suggest that Luke's account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus are modeled on that of Samuel.\n\nBULLET::::- Post-nativity\n\nUnique to the Gospel of Luke, John the Baptist explicitly teaches charity, baptizes tax-collectors, and advises soldiers.\n\nThe text briefly mentions that John is imprisoned and later beheaded by Herod, but the Gospel of Luke lacks the story of a step-daughter dancing for Herod and requesting John's head.\n\nThe Book of Acts portrays some disciples of John becoming followers of Jesus a development not reported by the gospels except for the early case of Andrew, Simon Peter's brother \nBULLET::::- Nativity of John (Luke 1)\nIn the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.\n\nOne day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\"\n\n\"How can I be sure of this?\" Zechariah asked the angel. \"For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\"\n\n\"I am Gabriel,\" the angel answered, \"who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said, \"he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\"\n\nSix months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: \"You have been shown great favor – the Lord is with you.\"\n\nMary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" Mary asked the angel. \"For I have no husband.\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\" answered the angel, \"and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"I am the servant of the Lord,\" exclaimed Mary; \"let it be with me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nSoon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd Mary said:\n\n\"My soul exalts the Lord,\nmy spirit delights in God my Savior;\nfor he has remembered his humble servant girl;\nAnd from this hour all ages will count me happy!\n\nGreat things has the Almighty done for me;\nAnd holy is his name.\nFrom age to age his mercy rests\nOn those who honor him.\n\nMighty are the deeds of his arm;\nHe scatters the proud with their own devices,\nhe casts down princes from their thrones,\nand the humble he uplifts,\nthe hungry he loads with gifts,\nand the rich he sends empty away.\n\nHe has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,\nEver mindful of his mercy\nFor Abraham and his race for ever.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: \"No, he is to be called John.\"\n\n\"You have no relation of that name!\" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words – 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another – \"What can this child be destined to become?\" For the Power of the Lord was with him.\n\nThen his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:\n\n\"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nWho has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,\nand has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation\nIn the house of his servant David –\n\nAs he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old –\nsalvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,\nshowing mercy to our forefathers,\nAnd mindful of his sacred covenant.\n\nThis was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham –\nThat we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,\nand should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,\nIn his presence all our days.\n\nAnd you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,\nFor you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,\nto give his people the knowledge of salvation\nIn the forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,\nto give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.\n\nBULLET::::- John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah –\n\n'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:\n\"Make ready the way of the Lord,\nMake his paths straight.\nEvery chasm will be filled,\nEvery mountain and hill will be leveled,\nThe winding ways will be straightened,\nThe rough roads made smooth,\nand everyone will see the salvation of God.\"'\n\nAnd John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: \"You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" the people asked. \"Let anyone who has two coats,\" answered John, \"share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.\"\n\nEven tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: \"Teacher, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,\" John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked \"And we – what are we to do?\" he said: \"Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.\"\n\nThen, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: \"I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.\"\n\nAnd so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done, crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice – \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.\"\n\nBULLET::::- John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)\n\"John's disciples,\" they said to Jesus, \"Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!\"\n\nBULLET::::- John questions Jesus (Luke 7)\nAll these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask – \"Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?\"\n\nWhen these men found Jesus, they said: \"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask – 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'\" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: \"Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard – the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.\"\n\nWhen John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says –\n\n'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nand he will prepare your way before you.'\n\nThere is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\". John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".\n\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor \"par excellence\"\", particularly when compared to figures like Nicodemus.\n\nJesus's baptism is implied but not depicted. Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing \"the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him\". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one \"who baptizes with the Holy Spirit\" and John even professes a \"belief that he is the Son of God\" and \"the Lamb of God\".\n\nThe Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification. In this debate John argued that Jesus \"must become greater,\" while he (John) \"must become less\" (Latin Vulgate: ).\n\nThe Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John. Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as \"a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light\".\nBULLET::::- John 1\nThere appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came as a witness – to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\n\nWhen the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John – \"Who are you?\", he told them clearly and simply: \"I am not the Christ.\"\n\n\"What then?\" they asked. \"Are you Elijah?\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"I am not.\"\n\"Are you 'the prophet'?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\"Who then are you?\" they continued; \"tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"\n\"I,\" he answered, \"am – 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness – \"make a straight road for the Lord\"', as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\nThese men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question was: \"Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet'?\" John's answer was – \"I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.\" This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: \"Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.\"\n\nJohn also said: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him – he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.\" The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: \"There is the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.\n\nBULLET::::- John 3\nJohn, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony – he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.\" John's answer was – \"A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less.\"\n\nHe who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'\nSimon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by painting him only as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus'.\nBULLET::::- The prophecy of Isaiah\n\nAlthough Mark's Gospel implies that the arrival of John the Baptist is the fulfilment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah, the words quoted (\"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way – a voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\") are actually a composite of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and the Book of Exodus. (Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)\n\nBULLET::::- Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\". John 12:28–30, John 1:32\n\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\n\nBULLET::::- John's knowledge of Jesus\n\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\nBULLET::::- John and Elijah\n\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to Elijah. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in , who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matt. 11:14 – see also Matt. 17:11–13); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah ().\"\n\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by Flavius Josephus (37–100):\n\nAccording to this passage, the execution of John was blamed for the defeat Herod suffered. Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in 36 AD. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod's marriage with Aretas' daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.\n\nDivergences between the passage's presentation and the biblical accounts of John include baptism for those whose souls have already been \"purified beforehand by righteousness\" is for purification of the body, not general repentance of sin (Mark 1:4). Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus, saying, \"John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise.\" To get baptized, Crossan writes, you went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it. Such a communal praxis was not just for himself, but could survive without him, unlike John's movement.\n\n records that \"his disciples came and took away [John's] body and buried it\". Theologian Joseph Benson refers to a belief that \"it seems that the body had been thrown over the prison walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias.\n\nThe burial-place of John the Baptist was traditionally said to be at the Nabi Yahya Mosque (Saint John the Baptiste Mosque) in Sebastia in current Palestinian territories, and mention is made of his relics being honored there around the middle of the 4th century. The historians Rufinus and Theodoretus record that the shrine was desecrated under Julian the Apostate around 362, the bones being partly burned. A portion of the rescued relics were carried to Jerusalem, then to Alexandria, where on 27 May 395, they were laid in the basilica newly dedicated to the Forerunner on the former site of the temple of Serapis. The tomb at Sebaste continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious pilgrims, and Saint Jerome bears witness to miracles being worked there.\n\nWhat became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine. Nicephorus and Symeon Metaphrastes say that Herodias had it buried in the fortress of Machaerus (in accordance with Josephus). Other writers say that it was interred in Herod's palace at Jerusalem; there it was found during the reign of Constantine I, and thence secretly taken to Emesa where it was concealed, the place remaining unknown for years, until it was manifested by revelation in 453. However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the Aachen Cathedral. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist. These are to be found in a monastery in Lower Egypt between Cairo and Alexandria. It is possible, with permission from the monks, to see the original tomb where the remains were found.\nBULLET::::- Several different locations claim to possess the severed head of John the Baptist. The current official place for the Catholic Church is the Shrine of Saint John the Baptiste (\"Nabi Yahya\" in Arabic) inside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. The place was visited by Pope John Paul II in 2001 who \"paused for a minute's silent meditation at the tomb of St John the Baptist\". Previous to that the catholic Church used to believe that it was kept in the San Silvestro in Capite in Rome; and then that it was held by the Knights Templar at Amiens Cathedral in France (brought home by Wallon de Sarton from the Fourth Crusade in Constantinople), at Antioch in Turkey (fate uncertain). Other traditions assume that it was in Residenz Museum in Munich, Germany (official residence of the Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria from 1385 to 1918). or even the parish church at Tenterden in Kent, where it was preserved up until the Reformation.\nBULLET::::- The saint's right hand, with which he baptised Jesus, is claimed to be in the Serbian Orthodox Cetinje monastery in Montenegro; Topkapi Palace in Istanbul; and also in the Romanian skete of the Forerunner on Mount Athos. The saint's left hand is allegedly preserved in the Armenian Apostolic Church of St. John at Chinsurah, West Bengal, where each year on \"Chinsurah Day\" in January it blesses the Armenian Christians of Calcutta. A crypt and relics said to be John's and mentioned in 11th- and 16th-century manuscripts, were discovered in 1969 during restoration of the Church of St. Macarius at the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in Scetes, Egypt; Additional relics are claimed to reside in Gandzasar Monastery's \"Cathedral of St. John the Baptist\", in Nagorno Karabakh.\n\nAnother obscure claim relates to the town of Halifax in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, where, as patron saint of the town, the Baptist's head appears on the official coat-of-arms. One legend (among others) bases the etymology of the town's place-name on \"halig\" (holy) and \"fax\" (face), claiming that a relic of the head, or face, of John the Baptist once existed in the town.Also, in 2010, bones were discovered in the ruins of a Bulgarian church in the St. John the Forerunner Monastery (4th–17th centuries) on the Black Sea island of St. Ivan and two years later, after DNA and radio carbon testing proved the bones belonged to a Middle Eastern man who lived in the 1st century AD, scientists said that the remains could conceivably have belonged to John the Baptist. The remains, found in a reliquarium are presently kept in the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Sozopol.\n\nThe Gospels describe John the Baptist as having had a specific role ordained by God as forerunner or precursor of Jesus, who was the foretold Messiah. The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\n\nThere are several passages within the Old Testament which are interpreted by Christians as being prophetic of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the Book of Malachi () that refers to a prophet who would \"prepare the way of the Lord\":\n\nand also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5–6 where it says,\n\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the Passover Seder. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in , \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\" The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n\nThese passages are applied to John in the Synoptic Gospels. But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor (), the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The Gospel of John states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.\n\nMany scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the Apostolic Age and what is called the \"Qumran-Essene community\". The Dead Sea Scrolls were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement. John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or \"associated\" with the community at Khirbet Qumran. According to the Book of Acts, Paul met some \"disciples of John\" in Ephesus.\n\nThe Catholic Church commemorates Saint John the Baptist on two feast days:\nBULLET::::- 24 June – Nativity of Saint John the Baptist\nBULLET::::- 29 August – Beheading of Saint John the Baptist\n\nAccording to Frederick Holweck, at the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to his mother Elizabeth, as recounted in Luke 1:39–57, John, sensing the presence of his Jesus, upon the arrival of Mary, leaped in the womb of his mother; he was then cleansed from original sin and filled with the grace of God. In her \"Treatise of Prayer\", Saint Catherine of Siena includes a brief altercation with the Devil regarding her fight due to the Devil attempting to lure her with vanity and flattery. Speaking in the first person, Catherine responds to the Devil with the following words:\n\nThe Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox faithful believe that John was the last of the Old Testament prophets, thus serving as a bridge between that period of revelation and the New Covenant. They also teach that, following his death, John descended into Hades and there once more preached that Jesus the Messiah was coming, so he was the Forerunner of Christ in death as he had been in life. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches will often have an icon of Saint John the Baptist in a place of honor on the iconostasis, and he is frequently mentioned during the Divine Services. Every Tuesday throughout the year is dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church remembers Saint John the Forerunner on six separate feast days, listed here in order in which they occur during the church year (which begins on September 1):\nBULLET::::- 23 September – Conception of Saint John the Forerunner\nBULLET::::- 7 January – The Synaxis of Saint John the Forerunner. This is his main ml day, immediately after Theophany on January 6 (January 7 also commemorates the transfer of the relic of the right hand of John the Baptist from Antioch to Constantinople in 956)\nBULLET::::- 24 February – First and Second Finding of the Head of Saint John the Forerunner\nBULLET::::- 25 May – Third Finding of the Head of Saint John the Forerunner\nBULLET::::- 24 June – Nativity of Saint John the Forerunner\nBULLET::::- 29 August – The Beheading of Saint John the Forerunner, a day of strict fast and abstinence from meat and dairy products and foods containing meat or dairy products\n\nIn addition to the above, 5 September is the commemoration of Zechariah and Elizabeth, Saint John's parents. The Russian Orthodox Church observes 12 October as the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from Malta to Gatchina (1799).\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that modern revelation confirms the biblical account of John and also makes known additional events in his ministry. According to this belief, John was \"ordained by the angel of God\" when he was eight days old \"to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews\" and to prepare a people for the Lord. Latter-day Saints also believe that \"he was baptized while yet in his childhood.\"\n\nJoseph Smith said: \"Let us come into New Testament times – so many are ever praising the Lord and His apostles. We will commence with John the Baptist. When Herod's edict went forth to destroy the young children, John was about six months older than Jesus, and came under this hellish edict, and Zecharias caused his mother to take him into the mountains, where he was raised on locusts and wild honey. When his father refused to disclose his hiding place, and being the officiating high priest at the Temple that year, was slain by Herod's order, between the porch and the altar, as Jesus said.\"\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints teaches that John the Baptist appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna River near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania as a resurrected being to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829, and ordained them to the Aaronic Priesthood. According to the Church's dispensational view of religious history, John's ministry has operated in three dispensations: he was the last of the prophets under the law of Moses; he was the first of the New Testament prophets; and he was sent to confirm the Aaronic Priesthood in our day (the dispensation of the fulness of times). Latter-day Saints believe John's ministry was foretold by two prophets whose teachings are included in the Book of Mormon: Lehi and his son Nephi.\n\nAmong the early Judeo-Christian Gnostics the Ebionites held that John, along with Jesus and James the Just—all of whom they revered—were vegetarians. Epiphanius of Salamis records that this group had amended their Gospel of Matthew—known today as the Gospel of the Ebionites—to change where John eats \"locusts\" to read \"honey cakes\" or \"manna\".\n\nJohn the Baptist is considered the chief prophet of the Mandaeans, and plays a large part in some of their writings, including the Ginza Rba and the Draša D-Iahia (The Mandaean Book of John). They view John as the only true Messiah, and are opposed to Jesus.\n\nJohn is also honored as a \"Nabi\" ({{lang-arنَـبِي}}, Prophet) as \"Yaḥyā ibn Zakarīyā\" ({{langarيَـحـيٰى بن زَكَـرِيّا}})), or \"Jehiah, son of Zechariah\", or simply \"Yaḥyā\" ({{lang-arيحيى}}). He is believed by Muslims to have been a witness to the word of God, and a prophet who would herald the coming of Jesus. His father Zechariah was also an Islamic prophet. Islamic tradition maintains that John was one of the prophets whom Muhammad met on the night of the Mi'raj, his ascension through the Seven Heavens. It is said that he met John and Jesus in the second heaven, where Muhammad greeted his two brothers before ascending with archangel Gabriel to the third heaven. John's story was also told to the Abyssinian king during the Muslim refugees' Migration to Abyssinia. According to the Qur'an, John was one on whom God sent peace on the day that he was born and the day that he died.\n\nIn the Quran, God frequently mentions Zechariah's continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zechariah's wife, mentioned in the New Testament as Elizabeth, was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible. As a gift from God, Zechariah (or Zakaria) was given a son by the name of \"Yaḥya\", a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zechariah's prayer, God made John and Jesus, who according to exegesis was born six months later, renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the Israelites. As the Quran says:\n\nHe said: \"O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?\"\n\nHe said: \"So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'\"\n\nJohn was exhorted to hold fast to the Scripture and was given wisdom by God while still a child. He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John's reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time. Muslim exegesis narrates that Jesus sent John out with twelve disciples, who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples. The Quran says:\n\nJohn was a classical prophet, who was exalted high by God, for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Qur'an speaks of John's gentle pity and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the Purity of Life:\n\nJohn is also honored highly in Sufism as well as Islamic mysticism, primarily because of the Quran's description of John's chastity and kindness. Sufis have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of \"Wisdom\" which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with Jesus. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.\n\nIt has been claimed that the Quran is mistaken in saying that John the Baptist was the first to receive this name ({{Cite quran197e=10s=ns}}), since the name Yoḥanan occurs many times before John the Baptist. However, according to Islamic scholars, \"Yaḥyā\" is not the same name as \"Yoḥanan\". Despite this, \"Yaḥyā\" is etymologically the same name as the Biblical figure Yᵉchîyâh (English rendering: \"Jehiah\") of the Books of the Chronicles. Therefore, the Qur'an in Surah 19:7 is likely not claiming that \"no one was ever given the name Yahya before this child\". Rather, this Qur'an verse is a clear reference to the Biblical account of the miraculous naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named \"Zacharias\" (Greek: Ζαχαρίας) after his father's name, as no one in the lineage of his father Zacharias (also known as Zechariah) had been named \"John\" (\"Yohanan\"/\"Yoannes\") before him.\n\nThe exegetes frequently connected the name with the meaning of \"to quicken\" or \"to make alive\" in reference to John's mother's barrenness, which was cured by God, as well as John's preaching, which, as Muslims believe, \"made alive\" the faith of Israel. This is the same meaning as the Hebrew name Yᵉchîyâh (יְחִיָּה; \"Jehiah\") (lit.: \"YHWH lives\"). Yᵉchîyâh was also the name of one of the doorkeepers for the Ark of the Covenant during the reign of King David in the Bible. Because of this, it is supposed that this name \"Yaḥyā\" was commonly used in the 6th–7th centuries CE by Arab Christians as an allegorical honorific of John the Baptist (Arabic: يُوحَنَّا الْمَعْمَدَانُ, Yūḥanna al-Mamadan), who considered him to be a \"doorkeeper\" for the \"Ark of the New Covenant\", Jesus Christ (Arabic: يَسُوعَ الْمَسِيحِ, Yasū'u l-Masīḥ).\n\nThe Quran also mentions a root used in the Hebrew name, 'Yohanan' {{langheיוֹחָנָןrtl=yes}} (Yahweh is gracious). Sura Maryam: 12–13 describes the virtues of Yahya: {{langarوَآتَيْنَاهُ الْحُكْمَ صَبِيًّا – وَحَنَانًا مِّن لَّدُنَّا وَزَكَاةً}} (And We gave him judgement, while yet a boy – And affection from Us, and purity.)\n\nBahá'ís consider John to have been a prophet of God who like all other prophets was sent to instill the knowledge of God, promote unity among the people of the world, and to show people the correct way to live. There are numerous quotations in the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, Founder of the Bahá'í Faith mentioning John the Baptist. He is regarded by Bahá'ís as a lesser Prophet. Bahá'u'lláh claimed that his Forerunner, the Báb, was the spiritual return of John the Baptist. In his letter to Pope Pius IX, Bahá'u'lláh wrote:\n\nO followers of the Son! We have once again sent John unto you, and He, verily, hath cried out in the wilderness of the Bayán: O peoples of the world! Cleanse your eyes! The Day whereon ye can behold the Promised One and attain unto Him hath drawn nigh! O followers of the Gospel! Prepare the way! The Day of the advent of the Glorious Lord is at hand! Make ready to enter the Kingdom. Thus hath it been ordained by God, He Who causeth the dawn to break.\n\nJohn is believed to have had the specific role of foretelling and preparing the way for Jesus. In condemning those who had 'turned aside' from him, Bahá'u'lláh, compared them to the followers of John the Baptist, who, he said, 'protested against Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus) saying: \"The dispensation of John hath not yet ended; wherefore hast thou come?\" Bahá'u'lláh believed that the Báb played the same role as John in preparing the people for his own coming. As such Bahá'u'lláh refers to the Báb as 'My Forerunner', the Forerunner being a title that Christians reserve for John the Baptist.\nHowever, Bahá'ís consider the Báb to be a greater Prophet (Manifestation of God) and thus possessed of a far greater station than John the Baptist.\n\nThe Unification Church teaches that God intended John to help Jesus during his public ministry in Judea. In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately John didn't follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders {{bibleverseJohn1:21NKJV}} contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come, {{bibleverseMatthew11:14NKJV}}. Many Jews therefore, could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in {{bibleverseMalachi4:5NKJV}}. According to the Unification Church, \"John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.\"\n\nJesus stated in {{bibleverseMatthew11:11NKJV}}, \"there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist,\" however, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of himself as the Messiah, said \"yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus' mission.\n\nScholars studying John the Baptist—particularly his relationship with Jesus of Nazareth—have commented on the difficulties they found between the two men.\n\nFor example, as reported in \"The Christian Post\", professor Candida Moss, of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame, who appeared in a documentary series \"Finding Jesus, Faith Fact Forgery,\" noted John and Jesus become \"de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace.\" Even after baptizing Jesus John did not follow Jesus but maintained a separate ministry. After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist. \n\nMichael H. Crosby, PhD, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?,\" stated there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby identifies twenty-five points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus’ disciples. Crosby noted that while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these \"signs\" convincing John, who continued a separate baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.\n\nCrosby stated \"an unbiased reading about John the Baptist \"leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus’ messiahship.\"\n\nRobert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper \"John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2Luke7:18–35NET}}).\" Deffinbaugh comments of the difficulty of a more through examination of John because of the inclination to think of him in only positive terms. He notes his past piety, humility and encouraging some of his disciples to follow Jesus instead. While he was \"a great man,\" Deffinbaugh also writes John \"is not a perfect man,\" and discusses what he calls \"the worst moment of John’s life, so far as the biblical record is concerned.\" He examines the incident where an imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.\n\nJohn is not asking an incidental question, writes Deffinbaugh, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily \"we will look for someone else to be the Messiah.\" Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.\" ({{bibleref2Luke7:22NET}}).\n\nThe beheading of Saint John the Baptist is a standard theme in Christian art, in which John's head is often depicted on a platter, which represents the request of Herod's stepdaughter, Salome. He is also depicted as an ascetic wearing camel hair, with a staff and scroll inscribed \"Ecce Agnus Dei\", or bearing a book or dish with a lamb on it. In Orthodox icons, he often has angel's wings, since Mark 1:2 describes him as a messenger.\n\nThe \"Baptism of Christ\" was one of the earliest scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" to be frequently depicted in Early Christian art, and John's tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the 5th century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In Byzantine art the composition of the \"Deesis\" came to be included in every Eastern Orthodox church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the Theotokos (Mary) flank a Christ Pantocrator and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western Crucifixions on roods and elsewhere, where John the Evangelist takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic \"Isenheim Altarpiece\"). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage – John was the patron saint of Florence, among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.\n\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the predella of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in grisaille fresco in the {{Interlanguage link multiChiostro dello Scalzoit}}, which was Andrea del Sarto's largest work, and the frescoed \"Life\" by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel, both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by Filippo Lippi in Prato Cathedral. These include the typical scenes: the \"Annunciation to Zechariah\", John's birth, his naming by his father, the \"Visitation\", John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the \"Baptism of Christ\", John before Herod, the dance of Salome, and his beheading.\n\nHis birth, which unlike the Nativity of Jesus allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late Middle Ages, with depictions by Jan van Eyck in the Turin-Milan Hours and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem, the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint. Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women (Delilah, Judith and others), and was often painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder and engraved by the Little Masters. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with Carlo Dolci painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from Pieter Brueghel the Elder and his successors.\n\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the \"Presentation of Christ\", the \"Marriage of the Virgin\" and the \"Holy Kinship\". Leonardo da Vinci's versions of the \"Virgin of the Rocks\" were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the Madonna and Child that included John. Raphael in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the \"Alba Madonna\", \"La belle jardinière\", \"Aldobrandini Madonna\", \"Madonna della seggiola\", \"Madonna dell'Impannata\", which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross – another theme influenced by Leonardo, whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael Titian and Guido Reni among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many Early Netherlandish paintings which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. Caravaggio painted an especially large number of works including John, from at least five largely nude youths attributed to him, to three late works on his death – the great \"Execution\" in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London.\n\nAmiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.\n\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is \"Christ in the House of His Parents\" by John Everett Millais. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into Joseph's carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join Mary, Joseph, and Mary's mother Anne in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with Symbolist painters such as Gustave Moreau and Puvis de Chavannes (National Gallery, London). Oscar Wilde's play \"Salome\" was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, giving rise to some of his most memorable images.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni chose John the Baptist as one of biblical figures on which she wrote poetry.\n\nBULLET::::- Guido D'Arezzo (991/992 – after 1033) an Italian Benedictine monk founded the standard music stave based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist. The hymn that begins with Ut Queant Laxis uses the first syllable for each line – Ut (later changed to Do), Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si. The teaching is also known as the solmization syllable.\nBULLET::::- \"This Is the Record of John\", by English Tudor composer Orlando Gibbons is a well-known part-setting of the Gospel of John for solo voice, choir and organ or viol accompaniment.\nBULLET::::- The reformer Martin Luther wrote a hymn based on biblical accounts about the Baptist, \"{{langdeChrist unser Herr zum Jordan kam}}\" (1541), base for a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach for the feast day on 24 June, {{langde\"Christ unser Herr zum Jordan kam\", BWV 7 italic=unset}} (1724).\nBULLET::::- {{Interlanguage link multiS.

Actors who have played John include James D. Ainsley in \"From the Manger to the Cross\" (1912), Nigel De Brulier in \"Salome\" (1923), Alan Badel in \"Salome\" (1953), Robert Ryan in \"King of Kings\" (1961), Mario Socrate in \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\" (1964), Charlton Heston in \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965), David Haskell in \"Godspell\" (1973), Michael York in \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977), Eli Cohen in Jesus (1979), Andre Gregory in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), Christopher Routh in \"Mary, Mother of Jesus\" (1999), David O'Hara in \"Jesus\" (1999), Scott Handy in \"The Gospel of John\" (2003), Aidan McArdle in \"Judas\" (2004), Daniel Percival in \"Son of God\" (2014) and Abhin Galeya in \"Killing Jesus\" (2015).\n\nSaint John the Baptist is the patron saint of Jordan: his beheading is said to have taken place in Machaerus in central Jordan.\n\nSaint John the Baptist is the patron saint of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its capital city, San Juan. In 1521, the island was given its formal name, \"\"San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico\"\", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the island. The names \"\"San Juan Bautista\"\" and \"\"Puerto Rico\"\" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a cartographic error. By 1746, the city's name (\"\"Puerto Rico\"\") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island (\"\"San Juan Bautista\"\") had become that of the city. The official motto of Puerto Rico also references the saint: \"Joannes Est Nomen Eius\" (Latin for \"his name is John\", from Luke 1:63).\n\nHe is also a patron saint of French Canada, and Newfoundland. The Canadian cities of St. John's, Newfoundland (1497), Saint John, New Brunswick (1604) and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Québec were all named in his honor. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in Quebec as the \"Fête Nationale du Québec\", and in Newfoundland as Discovery Day.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of Penzance, Cornwall. In Scotland, he is the patron saint of Perth, which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's professional football club is called St Johnstone F.C.\n\nAlso, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of Porto, the second largest city in Portugal. An article from June 2004 in \"The Guardian\" remarked that \"Porto's Festa de São João is one of Europe's liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country\".\n\nHe is also patron of the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, Malta, Florence, and Genoa, Italy. John is patron saint of Xewkija, Gozo, Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to June 24.\n\nCalamba City, Laguna, Calumpit, Bulacan, Balayan and Lian in Batangas, Sipocot and San Fernando, Camarines Sur, Daet, Camarines Norte and San Juan, Metro Manila are among several places in the Philippines that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many Filipino fiestas in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to Songkran and Holi, and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the Black Nazarene it enshrines, Quiapo Church in Manila is actually dedicated to Saint John.\n\nHe is also patron of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston, which covers the whole of South Carolina in the United States.\n\nThe Baptistines are the name given to a number of religious orders dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.\n\nAlong with John the Evangelist, John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of Free and Accepted Masons (better known as the Freemasons).\n\nBULLET::::- Basilica of St. John the Baptist, Berlin\nBULLET::::- Biblical and Quranic narratives\nBULLET::::- Chronology of Jesus\nBULLET::::- Historical background of the New Testament\nBULLET::::- Legends and the Quran\nBULLET::::- List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources\nBULLET::::- Messengers from John the Baptist\nBULLET::::- Saint John the Baptist Church (disambiguation)\nBULLET::::- St. John Baptist Church (disambiguation)\nBULLET::::- Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge\n\nBULLET::::- Brooks Hansen (2009) \"John the Baptizer: A Novel\".

His 1968 novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\", about an overpopulated world, won the 1969 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel, and the BSFA award the same year. \"The Jagged Orbit\" won the BSFA award in 1970.\n\nBrunner was born in 1934 in Preston Crowmarsh, near Wallingford in Oxfordshire, and went to school at St Andrew's Prep School, Pangbourne. He did his upper studies at Cheltenham College. He wrote his first novel, \"Galactic Storm\", at 17, and published it under the pen-name Gill Hunt. He did not start writing full-time until 1958, some years after his military service.\n\nHe served as an officer in the Royal Air Force from 1953 to 1955. He married Marjorie Rosamond Sauer on 12 July 1958.\n\nBrunner had an uneasy relationship with British new wave writers, who often considered him too American in his settings and themes. He attempted to shift to a more mainstream readership in the early 1980s, without success. Before his death, most of his books had fallen out of print. Brunner accused publishers of a conspiracy against him. But he was known to be difficult to deal with (his wife Marjorie Brunner had handled his publishing relations before she died).\n\nBrunner's health began to decline in the 1980s and worsened with the death of his wife in 1986. He remarried, to Li Yi Tan, on 27 September 1991. He died of a heart attack in Glasgow on 25 August 1995, while attending the World Science Fiction Convention there.\n\nAt first writing conventional space opera, Brunner later began to experiment with the novel form. His 1968 novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\" exploits the fragmented organizational style that American writer John Dos Passos created for his \"USA trilogy\", but updates it in terms of the theory of media popularised by Canadian academic Marshall McLuhan, a major cultural figure of the period.\n\n\"The Jagged Orbit\" (1969) is set in a United States dominated by weapons proliferation and interracial violence. Its 100 numbered chapters vary in length from a single syllable to several pages in length. \"The Sheep Look Up\" (1972) depicts ecological catastrophe in America.\n\nBrunner is credited with coining the term \"worm\" and predicting the emergence of computer viruses in his 1975 novel \"The Shockwave Rider\", in which he used the term to describe software which reproduces itself across a computer network. Brunner's work has also been credited for prefiguring modern developments such as genetic engineering, same-sex marriage, online encyclopedias, the legalization of cannabis, and the development of Viagra.\n\nThese four novels Stand on Zanzibar (1968), The Jagged Orbit (1969), The Sheep Look Up (1972) and The Shockwave Rider (1975), have been called the \"Club of Rome Quartet\", named after the Club of Rome, whose 1972 report \"The Limits to Growth\" warned of the dire effects of overpopulation.\n\nBrunner's pen names include K. H. Brunner (Kilian Houston Brunner), Gill Hunt, John Loxmith, Trevor Staines, Ellis Quick, Henry Crosstrees Jr., and Keith Woodcott.\n\nIn addition to his fiction, Brunner wrote poetry and published many unpaid articles in a variety of venues, particularly fanzines. He also published 13 letters to the \"New Scientist\" and an article about the educational relevance of science fiction in \"Physics Education\". Brunner was an active member of the organisation Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and wrote the words to \"The H-Bomb's Thunder\", which was sung on the Aldermaston Marches. He was a linguist, translator, and Guest of Honour at the first European Science Fiction Convention \"Eurocon-1\" in Trieste in 1972.\n\nBrunner wrote the screenplay for the science fiction film \"The Terrornauts\" (1967) by Amicus Productions.\n\nTwo of his short stories, \"Some Lapse of Time\" and \"The Last Lonely Man\", were adapted as TV plays in the BBC science fiction series \"Out of the Unknown\", in series 1 (1965) and series 3 (1969), respectively.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Galactic Storm\" (1951) (as Gill Hunt)\nBULLET::::- \"Threshold of Eternity\", Ace D-335 (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"The 100th Millennium\", Ace D-362 (1959); based on \"Earth Is But a Star\", revised as \"Catch a Falling Star\", Ace G-761 (1968)\nBULLET::::- \"Echo in the Skull\", Ace D-385 (1959); revised as \"Give Warning to the World\", DAW 112 (1974)\nBULLET::::- \"The World Swappers\", Ace D-391 (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"The Brink\", Gollancz (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"Slavers of Space\", Ace D-421 (1960); revised as \"Into the Slave Nebula\", Lancer (1968)\nBULLET::::- \"The Skynappers\", Ace D-457 (1960)\nBULLET::::- \"The Atlantic Abomination\", Ace D-465 (1960)\nBULLET::::- \"Sanctuary in the Sky\", Ace D-471 (1960)\nBULLET::::- \"I Speak for Earth\", Ace D-497 (1961) (as Keith Woodcott)\nBULLET::::- \"Meeting at Infinity\", Ace D-507 (1961)\nBULLET::::- \"Secret Agent of Terra\", Ace F-133 (1962); revised as \"The Avengers of Carrig\", Dell (1969).

{"id": "16130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16130", "title": "Jack Butler Yeats", "text": "Jack Butler Yeats\n\nJack Butler Yeats RHA (29 August 1871 – 28 March 1957) was an Irish artist and Olympic medalist. W. B. Yeats was his brother.\n\nButler's early style was that of an illustrator; he only began to work regularly in oils in 1906. His early pictures are simple lyrical depictions of landscapes and figures, predominantly from the west of Ireland—especially of his boyhood home of Sligo. Yeats's work contains elements of Romanticism.\n\nYeats was born in London, England. He was the youngest son of Irish portraitist John Butler Yeats and the brother of W. B. Yeats, who received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature. He grew up in Sligo with his maternal grandparents, before returning to his parents' home in London in 1887. Early in his career he worked as an illustrator for magazines like the \"Boy's Own Paper\" and \"Judy\", drew comic strips, including the Sherlock Holmes parody \"Chubb-Lock Homes\" for \"Comic Cuts\", and wrote articles for \"Punch\" under the pseudonym \"W. Bird\". In 1894 he married Mary Cottenham, also a native of England and two years his senior, and resided in Wicklow according to the Census of Ireland, 1911.\n\nFrom around 1920, he developed into an intensely Expressionist artist, moving from illustration to Symbolism. He was sympathetic to the Irish Republican cause, but not politically active. However, he believed that 'a painter must be part of the land and of the life he paints', and his own artistic development, as a Modernist and Expressionist, helped articulate a modern Dublin of the 20th century, partly by depicting specifically Irish subjects, but also by doing so in the light of universal themes such as the loneliness of the individual, and the universality of the plight of man. Samuel Beckett wrote that \"Yeats is with the great of our time... because he brings light, as only the great dare to bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence.\" The Marxist art critic and author John Berger also paid tribute to Yeats from a very different perspective, praising the artist as a \"great painter\" with a \"sense of the future, an awareness of the possibility of a world other than the one we know\".\n\nHis favourite subjects included the Irish landscape, horses, circus and travelling players. His early paintings and drawings are distinguished by an energetic simplicity of line and colour, his later paintings by an extremely vigorous and experimental treatment of often thickly applied paint. He frequently abandoned the brush altogether, applying paint in a variety of different ways, and was deeply interested in the expressive power of colour. Despite his position as the most important Irish artist of the 20th century (and the first to sell for over £1m), he took no pupils and allowed no one to watch him work, so he remains a unique figure. The artist closest to him in style is his friend, the Austrian painter, Oskar Kokoschka.\n\nBesides painting, Yeats had a significant interest in theatre and in literature. He was a close friend of Samuel Beckett. He designed sets for the Abbey Theatre, and three of his own plays were also produced there. He wrote novels in a stream of consciousness style that Joyce acknowledged , and also many essays. His literary works include \"The Careless Flower\", \"The Amaranthers\" (much admired by Beckett), \"Ah Well, A Romance in Perpetuity\", \"And To You Also\", and \"The Charmed Life\". Yeats's paintings usually bear poetic and evocative titles. Indeed, his father recognized that Jack was a far better painter than he, and also believed that 'some day I will be remembered as the father of a great poet, and the poet is Jack'. He was elected a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1916. He died in Dublin in 1957, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.\n\nYeats holds the distinction of being Ireland's first medalist at the Olympic Games in the wake of creation of the Irish Free State. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Yeats' painting \"The Liffey Swim\" won a silver medal in the arts and culture segment of the Games. In the competition records the painting is simply entitled \"Swimming\".\n\nIn November 2010, one of Yeats's works, \"A Horseman Enters a Town at Night\", painted in 1948 and previously owned by novelist Graham Greene, sold for nearly £350,000 at a Christie's auction in London.

{"id": "16132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16132", "title": "Joseph Yoakum", "text": "Joseph Yoakum\n\nJoseph Elmer Yoakum (February 22, ca. 1890 – December 25, 1972) was a self-taught landscape artist of African-American and possible Native American descent, who drew landscapes in a highly individual style. He was 76 when he started to record his memories in the form of imaginary landscapes, and he produced over 2,000 drawings during the last decade of his life. His work is an example of Outsider Art.\n\nYoakum official records note that Yoakum was born in Ash Grove, Missouri, but he told a story of being born in Arizona, in 1888, as a Navajo Indian on the Window Rock Navajo reservation. Taking pride in his invented Native heritage, Yoakum would pronounce \"Navajo\" as \"Na-va-JOE\" (as in \"Joseph\"). His biographical information is difficult to verify but he also claimed to be of African, French, and Cherokee descent. He spent his early childhood on a Missouri farm. His birthdates have also been given as 1886, 1888, and 1891, and his Veteran's Administration record says he was born in Springfield, Missouri.\n\nYoakum left home when he was nine years old to join the Great Wallace Circus. As a billposter, he also traveled across the U.S. with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and the Ringling Brothers, among the five different circuses. He later traveled to Europe as a stowaway.\n\nIn 1908, he returned to Missouri and started a family with his girlfriend Myrtle Julian, with whom he had his first son in 1909; the couple married in 1910. Yoakum was drafted into army service in 1918 and worked in the 805th Pioneer Infantry repairing roads and railroads. \n\nAfter the war, he traveled around the U.S. working odd jobs, but he never returned to his family. He later remarried and moved to Chicago. In 1946, Yoakum was committed to a psychiatric hospital there. He soon left and by the early 1950s, he was drawing on a regular basis. He worked in a coal mine to support his family.\n\nYoakum was again living and painting in Chicago by 1962. Tom Brand, owner of Galaxy Press on the south side of Chicago, in 1968 had some printing to deliver to a coffee shop called \"The Whole\". While there he noticed the colored pencil drawings of Yoakum and was immediately taken by them. Brand had an account with the Ed Sherbyn Gallery on the north side of Chicago, and he persuaded Sherbyn to exhibit Yoakum's works and even printed his own poster for this show. Norman Mark of \"The Chicago Daily News\" wrote an article about Yoakum called \"My drawings are a spiritual unfoldment\"; this article was printed on the back of the poster. Brand informed his artist friends (including Whitney Halstead) about Yoakum and encouraged them to visit the Whole coffee shop. Halstead, an artist and instructor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, became the greatest promoter of Yoakum's work during his lifetime. He believed that his story was \"more invention than reality... in part myth, Yoakum's life as he would have wished to have lived it.\"\n\nIn 1967, Yoakum was discovered by the mainstream art community through John Hopgood, an instructor at the Chicago State College, who saw Yoakum's work hanging in his studio window and purchased twenty-two pictures. A group of students including Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, and Barbara Rossi, and teachers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, including Ray Yoshida and Whitney Halstead, took an interest in promoting his work. In 1972, just one month before his death, Yoakum was given a one-man show at the Whitney Museum in New York City. \n\nHe started drawing familiar places, such as \"Green Valley Ashville Kentucky\", as a method to capture his memories. However, he shifted towards imaginary landscapes in places he had never visited, like \"Mt Cloubelle of West India\" or \"Mt Mowbullan in Dividing Range near Brisbane Australia\". Drawing outlines with ballpoint pen, rarely making corrections, he colored his drawings within the lines using watercolors and pastels. He became known for his organic forms, always using two lines to designate land masses. \n\nDuring the final four months of his life Yoakum's work was marked by a use of pure abstraction, as in his illustration \"Flooding of Sock River through Ash Grove Mo [Missouri] on July 4, 1914 in that [waters] drove many persons from Homes I were with the Groupe their homes for safety\". That painting was one of his autobiographical works.\n\nSources\nBULLET::::- Depasse, Derrel B. (2001). \"Traveling the Rainbow: The Life and Art of Joseph E. Yoakum\".

{"id": "16134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16134", "title": "Jefferson Davis", "text": "Jefferson Davis\n\nJefferson Finis Davis (June 3, 1808 – December 6, 1889) was an American politician who served as the president of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865. As a member of the Democratic Party, he represented Mississippi in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives before the American Civil War. He previously served as the United States Secretary of War from 1853 to 1857 under President Franklin Pierce.\n\nDavis was born in Fairview, Kentucky, to a moderately prosperous farmer, the youngest of ten children. He grew up in Wilkinson County, Mississippi, and also lived in Louisiana. His eldest brother Joseph Emory Davis secured the younger Davis's appointment to the United States Military Academy. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi, which his brother Joseph gave him, and owned as many as 113 slaves. Although Davis argued against secession in 1858, he believed that states had an unquestionable right to leave the Union.\n\nDavis married Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of general and future President Zachary Taylor, in 1835, when he was 27 years old. They were both stricken with malaria soon thereafter, and Sarah died after three months of marriage. Davis recovered slowly and suffered from recurring bouts of the disease throughout his life. At the age of 36, Davis married again, to 18-year-old Varina Howell, a native of Natchez, Mississippi, who had been educated in Philadelphia and had some family ties in the North. They had six children. Only two survived him, and only one married and had children.\n\nMany historians attribute some of the Confederacy's weaknesses to the poor leadership of Davis. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, inability to get along with people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion all worked against him. Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart, President Abraham Lincoln. After Davis was captured in 1865, he was accused of treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, Robert E. Lee. Davis wrote a memoir entitled \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\", which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot. He became a hero of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy in the post-Reconstruction South.\n\nJefferson Finis Davis was born at the family homestead in Fairview, Kentucky, on June 3, 1808. He sometimes gave his year of birth as 1807. He dropped his middle name in later life, although he sometimes used a middle initial. Davis was the youngest of ten children born to Jane (née Cook) and Samuel Emory Davis; his oldest brother Joseph Emory Davis was 23 years his senior. He was named after then-incumbent President Thomas Jefferson, whom his father admired. In the early 20th century, the Jefferson Davis State Historic Site was established near the site of Davis's birth. Coincidentally, Abraham Lincoln was born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, only eight months later, less than to the northeast of Fairview.\n\nDavis's paternal grandparents were born in the region of Snowdonia in North Wales, and immigrated separately to North America in the early 18th century. His maternal ancestors were English. After initially arriving in Philadelphia, Davis's paternal grandfather Evan settled in the colony of Georgia, which was developed chiefly along the coast. He married the widow Lydia Emory Williams, who had two sons from a previous marriage, and their son Samuel Emory Davis was born in 1756. He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, along with his two older half-brothers. In 1783, after the war, he married Jane Cook. She was born in 1759 to William Cook and his wife Sarah Simpson in what is now Christian County, Kentucky. In 1793, the Davis family relocated to Kentucky, establishing a community named \"Davisburg\" on the border of Christian and Todd counties; it was eventually renamed Fairview.\n\nDuring Davis's childhood, his family moved twice: in 1811 to St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and less than a year later to Wilkinson County, Mississippi. Three of his older brothers served in the War of 1812. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of Woodville, near the family cotton plantation. His brother Joseph acted as a surrogate father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school operated by the Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, he was the only Protestant student at the school. Davis returned to Mississippi in 1818, studying at Jefferson College in Washington. He returned to Kentucky in 1821, studying at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, roughly equivalent to high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.\n\nJoseph arranged for Davis to get an appointment and attend the United States Military Academy (West Point) starting in late 1824. While there, he was placed under house arrest for his role in the Eggnog Riot during Christmas 1826. Cadets smuggled whiskey into the academy to make eggnog, and more than one-third of the cadets were involved in the incident. In June 1828, Davis graduated 23rd in a class of 33.\n\nFollowing graduation, Second Lieutenant Davis was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment and was stationed at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien, Michigan Territory. Zachary Taylor, a future president of the United States, had assumed command shortly before Davis arrived in early 1829. In March 1832, Davis returned to Mississippi on furlough, having had no leave since he first arrived at Fort Crawford. He was still in Mississippi during the Black Hawk War but returned to the fort in August. At the conclusion of the war, Colonel Taylor assigned him to escort Black Hawk to prison. Davis made an effort to shield Black Hawk from curiosity seekers, and the chief noted in his autobiography that Davis treated him \"with much kindness\" and showed empathy for the leader's situation as a prisoner.\n\nDavis fell in love with Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of his commanding officer, Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave, but he did not tell Taylor he intended to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.\n\nDavis's older brother Joseph had been very successful and owned Hurricane Plantation and of adjoining land along the Mississippi River on a peninsula south of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The adjoining land was known as Brierfield, since it was largely covered with brush and briers. Wanting to have his youngest brother and his wife nearby, Joseph gave use of Brierfield to Jefferson, who eventually developed Brierfield Plantation there. Joseph retained the title.\n\nIn August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah traveled south to his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. They intended to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, for their health, but both of them contracted either malaria or yellow fever. Sarah died at the age of 21 on September 15, 1835, after three months of marriage. Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for his life. In the month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.\n\nIn late 1835, Davis sailed from New Orleans to Havana, Cuba, to help restore his health. He was accompanied by James Pemberton, his only slave at the time. Davis observed the Spanish military and sketched fortifications. Although no evidence points to his having any motive beyond general interest, the authorities knew that Davis was a former army officer and warned him to stop his observations. Bored and feeling somewhat better, Davis booked passage on a ship to New York, then continued to Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate George Wallace Jones. He soon returned with Pemberton to Mississippi.\n\nFor several years following Sarah's death, Davis was reclusive and honored her memory. He spent time clearing Brierfield and developing his plantation, studied government and history, and had private political discussions with his brother Joseph. By early 1836, Davis had purchased 16 slaves; he held 40 slaves by 1840, and 74 by 1845. Davis promoted Pemberton to be overseer of the field teams. In 1860, he owned 113 slaves.\n\nIn 1840, Davis first became involved in politics when he attended a Democratic Party meeting in Vicksburg and, to his surprise, was chosen as a delegate to the party's state convention in Jackson. In 1842, he attended the Democratic convention, and, in 1843, became a Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives from the Warren County-Vicksburg district; he lost his first election. In 1844, Davis was sent to the party convention for a third time, and his interest in politics deepened. He was selected as one of six presidential electors for the 1844 presidential election and campaigned effectively throughout Mississippi for the Democratic candidate James K. Polk.\n\nIn 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 18 years old, whom his brother Joseph had invited for the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell; her mother's family was from the South and included successful Scots-Irish planters. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.\n\nDuring this time, Davis was persuaded to become a candidate for the United States House of Representatives and began canvassing for the election. In early October 1845 he traveled to Woodville to give a speech. He arrived a day early to visit his mother there, only to find that she had died the day before. After the funeral, he rode the back to Natchez to deliver the news, then returned to Woodville again to deliver his speech. He won the election and entered the 29th Congress.\n\nJefferson and Varina had six children; three died before reaching adulthood. Samuel Emory, born July 30, 1852, was named after his grandfather; he died June 30, 1854, of an undiagnosed disease. Margaret Howell was born February 25, 1855, and was the only child to marry and raise a family. She married Joel Addison Hayes, Jr. (1848–1919), and they had five children. They were married in St. Lazarus Church, nicknamed \"The Confederate Officers' Church\", in Memphis, Tennessee. In the late 19th century, they moved from Memphis to Colorado Springs, Colorado. She died on July 18, 1909, at the age of 54.\n\nJefferson Davis, Jr., was born January 16, 1857. He died at age 21 because of yellow fever on October 16, 1878, during an in the Mississippi River Valley that caused 20,000 deaths. Joseph Evan, born on April 18, 1859, died at the age of five due to an accidental fall on April 30, 1864. William Howell, born on December 6, 1861, was named for Varina's father; he died of diphtheria at age 10 on October 16, 1872. Varina Anne, known as \"Winnie\", was born on June 27, 1864, several months after her brother Joseph's death. She was known as the Daughter of the Confederacy as she was born during the war. After her parents refused to let her marry into a northern abolitionist family, she never married. She died nine years after her father, on September 18, 1898, at age 34. Jim Limber an octoroon (mixed race) orphan was briefly a ward of Jefferson Davis and Varina Howell Davis.\n\nDavis had poor health for most of his life, including repeated bouts of malaria, battle wounds from fighting in the Mexican–American War and a chronic eye infection that made bright light painful. He also had trigeminal neuralgia, a nerve disorder that causes severe pain in the face; it has been called one of the most painful known ailments.\n\nIn 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis raised a volunteer regiment, the Mississippi Rifles, becoming its colonel under the command of his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles because it was the first to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.\n\nIn September 1846, Davis participated in the Battle of Monterrey, during which he led a successful charge on the La Teneria fort. On October 28, Davis resigned his seat in the House of Representatives. On February 22, 1847, Davis fought bravely at the Battle of Buena Vista and was shot in the foot, being carried to safety by Robert H. Chilton. In recognition of Davis's bravery and initiative, Taylor is reputed to have said, \"My daughter, sir, was a better judge of men than I was.\" On May 17, President Polk offered Davis a federal commission as a brigadier general and command of a brigade of militia. Davis declined the appointment, arguing that the Constitution gives the power of appointing militia officers to the states, not the federal government.\n\nHonoring Davis's war service, Governor Albert G. Brown of Mississippi appointed him to the vacant position of United States Senator Jesse Speight, a Democrat, who had died on May 1, 1847. Davis, also a Democrat, took his temporary seat on December 5, and in January 1848 he was elected by the state legislature to serve the remaining two years of the term. In December, during the 30th United States Congress, Davis was made a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and began serving on the Committee on Military Affairs and the Library Committee.\n\nIn 1848, Senator Davis proposed and introduced an amendment (the first of several) to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that would have annexed most of northeastern Mexico, but it failed on a vote of 11 to 44. Southerners wanted to increase territory held in Mexico as an area for the expansion of slavery. Regarding Cuba, Davis declared that it \"must be ours\" to \"increase the number of slaveholding constituencies.\" He also was concerned about the security implications of a Spanish holding lying relatively close to the coast of Florida.\n\nA group of Cuban revolutionaries led by Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López intended to liberate Cuba from Spanish rule by the sword. Searching for a military leader for a filibuster expedition, they first offered command of the Cuban forces to General William J. Worth, but he died before making his decision. In the summer of 1849, López visited Davis and asked him to lead the expedition. He offered an immediate payment of $100,000 (worth more than $2,000,000 in 2013), plus the same amount when Cuba was liberated. Davis turned down the offer, stating that it was inconsistent with his duty as a senator. When asked to recommend someone else, Davis suggested Robert E. Lee, then an army major in Baltimore; López approached Lee, who also declined on the grounds of his duty.\n\nThe Senate made Davis chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs on December 3, 1849, during the first session of the 31st United States Congress. On December 29 he was elected to a full six-year term (by the Mississippi legislature, as the constitution mandated at the time). Davis had not served a year when he resigned (in September 1851) to run for the governorship of Mississippi on the issue of the Compromise of 1850, which he opposed. He was defeated by fellow Senator Henry Stuart Foote by 999 votes. Left without political office, Davis continued his political activity. He took part in a convention on states' rights, held at Jackson, Mississippi, in January 1852. In the weeks leading up to the presidential election of 1852, he campaigned in numerous Southern states for Democratic candidates Franklin Pierce and William R. King.\n\nFranklin Pierce, after winning the presidential election, made Davis his Secretary of War in 1853. In this capacity, Davis began the Pacific Railroad Surveys in order to determine various possible routes for the proposed Transcontinental Railroad. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today's southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because it would provide an easier southern route for the new railroad; the Pierce administration agreed and the land was purchased in December 1853. He saw the size of the regular army as insufficient to fulfill its mission, maintaining that salaries would have to be increased, something which had not occurred for 25 years. Congress agreed and increased the pay scale. It also added four regiments, which increased the army's size from about 11,000 to about 15,000. Davis also introduced general usage of the rifles that he had used successfully during the Mexican–American War. As a result, both the morale and capability of the army was improved. He became involved in public works when Pierce gave him responsibility for construction of the Washington Aqueduct and an expansion of the U.S. Capitol, both of which he managed closely. The Pierce administration ended in 1857 after Pierce's loss of the Democratic nomination to James Buchanan. Davis's term was to end with Pierce's, so he ran for the Senate, was elected, and re-entered it on March 4, 1857.\n\nIn the 1840s, tensions were growing between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, it would have banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the Dred Scott case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.\n\nDavis's renewed service in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him with the loss of his left eye. He was forced to remain in a darkened room for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.\n\nAs he explained in his memoir \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\", Davis believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, because he did not think that the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, he also knew that the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary for defense in a war. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, however, events accelerated. South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but waited until he received official notification. On January 21, the day Davis called \"the saddest day of my life\", he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate, resigned and returned to Mississippi.\n\nIn 1861, the Episcopal Church split and Davis became a member of the newly founded Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. He attended St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond while he was President of the Confederacy. The two denominations were reunited in 1865.\n\nAnticipating a call for his services since Mississippi had seceded, Davis had sent a telegraph message to Governor John J. Pettus saying, \"Judge what Mississippi requires of me and place me accordingly.\" On January 23, 1861, Pettus made Davis a major general of the Army of Mississippi. On February 9, a constitutional convention met at Montgomery, Alabama, and considered Davis and Robert Toombs of Georgia as a possible president. Davis, who had widespread support from six of the seven states, easily won. He was seen as the \"champion of a slave society and embodied the values of the planter class\", and was elected provisional Confederate President by acclamation. He was inaugurated on February 18, 1861. Alexander H. Stephens was chosen as Vice President, but he and Davis feuded constantly.\n\nDavis was the first choice because of his strong political and military credentials. He wanted to serve as commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies but said he would serve wherever directed. His wife Varina Davis later wrote that when he received word that he had been chosen as president, \"Reading that telegram he looked so grieved that I feared some evil had befallen our family.\"\n\nSeveral forts in Confederate territory remained in Union hands. Davis sent a commission to Washington with an offer to pay for any federal property on Southern soil, as well as the Southern portion of the national debt, but Lincoln refused to meet with the commissioners. Brief informal discussions did take place with Secretary of State William Seward through Supreme Court Justice John A. Campbell, the latter of whom later resigned from the federal government, as he was from Alabama. Seward hinted that Fort Sumter would be evacuated, but gave no assurance.\n\nOn March 1, 1861, Davis appointed General P. G. T. Beauregard to command all Confederate troops in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geopolitical posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union garrison had but half a dozen officers and 127 soldiers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Captain (later major general) Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The U.S. President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. For Lincoln, Davis, as the leader of an insurrection, was without legal standing in U.S. affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. The fact that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fort. He informed Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from at sea.\n\nDavis faced the most important decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, to use military force to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Anderson did not surrender. With Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one was killed in the artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fort meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up 75,000 state militiamen to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.\n\nWhen Virginia joined the Confederacy, Davis moved his government to Richmond in May 1861. He and his family took up his residence there at the White House of the Confederacy later that month. Having served since February as the provisional president, Davis was elected to a full six-year term on November 6, 1861, and was inaugurated on February 22, 1862.\n\nAt the start of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North compared to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners were terrified at the idea of a black man with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and \"owned\". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity; built nearly all the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery; and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.\n\nMuch of the railroad track that existed in the Confederacy was of simple railway design just meant to carry the large bales of cotton to local river ports in the harvest season. These often did not connect to other rail-lines, making internal shipments of goods difficult at best. While the Union had a large navy, the new Confederate Navy had only a few captured warships or newly built vessels. These did surprisingly well but ultimately were sunk or abandoned as the Union Navy controlled more rivers and ports. Rebel 'raiders' loosed on the Northern ships on the Atlantic did tremendous damage and sent Yankee ships into safe harbors as insurance rates soared. The Union blockade of the South, however, made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive. Somewhat awkwardly, these runners didn't bring significant amounts of war materials that were so desperately needed, but rather the European luxuries sought as a relief from the war's horrifying conditions.\n\nIn June 1862, Davis was forced to assign General Robert E. Lee to replace the wounded Joseph E. Johnston to command of the Army of Northern Virginia, the main Confederate army in the Eastern Theater. That December Davis made a tour of Confederate armies in the west of the country. He had a very small circle of military advisers. He largely made the main strategic decisions on his own, though he had special respect for Lee's views. Given the Confederacy's limited resources compared with the Union, Davis decided that the Confederacy would have to fight mostly on the strategic defensive. He maintained this outlook throughout the war, paying special attention to the defense of his national capital at Richmond. He approved Lee's strategic offensives when he felt that military success would both shake Northern self-confidence and strengthen the peace movements there. However, the several campaigns invading the North were met with defeat. A bloody battle at Antietam in Maryland as well as the ride into Kentucky, the Confederate Heartland Offensive (both in 1862) drained irreplaceable men and talented officers. A final offense led to the three-day bloodletting at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania (1863), crippling the South still further. The status of techniques and munitions made the defensive side much more likely to endure: an expensive lesson vindicating Davis's initial belief.\n\nAs provisional president in 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia was the first Secretary of State and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became Secretary of the Treasury. LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made Secretary of War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis insisted that he was the best man for the job of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.\n\nSince the Confederacy was founded, among other things, on states' rights, one important factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.\n\nAs the war progressed, this dissatisfaction increased and there were frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned within a few months of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.\n\nFollowing the November 1861 election, Davis announced the permanent cabinet in March 1862. Benjamin moved again, to Secretary of State. George W. Randolph of Virginia had been made the Secretary of War. Mallory continued as Secretary of the Navy and Reagan as Postmaster General. Both kept their positions throughout the war. Memminger remained Secretary of the Treasury, while Thomas Hill Watts of Alabama was made Attorney General.\n\nIn 1862 Randolph resigned from the War Department, and James Seddon of Virginia was appointed to replace him. In late 1863, Watts resigned as Attorney General to take office as the Governor of Alabama, and George Davis of North Carolina took his place. In 1864, Memminger withdrew from the Treasury post due to congressional opposition, and was replaced by George Trenholm of South Carolina. In 1865 congressional opposition likewise caused Seddon to withdraw, and he was replaced by John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky.\n\nCotton was the South's primary export and the basis of its economy and the system of production the South used was dependent upon slave labor. At the outset of the Civil War, Davis realized that intervention from European powers would be vital if the Confederacy was to stand against the Union. The administration sent repeated delegations to European nations, but several factors prevented Southern success in terms of foreign diplomacy. The Union blockade of the Confederacy led European powers to remain neutral, contrary to the Southern belief that a blockade would cut off the supply of cotton to Britain and other European nations and prompt them to intervene on behalf of the South. Many European countries objected to slavery. Britain had abolished it in the 1830s, and Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 made support for the South even less appealing in Europe. Finally, as the war progressed and the South's military prospects dwindled, foreign powers were not convinced that the Confederacy had the strength to become independent. In the end, not a single foreign nation recognized the Confederate States of America.\n\nMost historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed military strategy, his selection of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until late in the war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. \"Davis was loathed by much of his military, Congress and the public — even before the Confederacy died on his watch,\" and General Beauregard wrote in a letter: \"If he were to die today, the whole country would rejoice at it.\"\n\nOn January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources of the South and made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union took control of the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces on both sides of the Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together. In fact, during the late stages of the Franklin–Nashville Campaign, Davis warned Beauregard that Kirby Smith would prove uncooperative to whatever proposal the Creole general had in mind for him.\n\nDavis has been faulted for poor coordination and management of his generals. This includes his reluctance to resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a personal friend, and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood, a fellow Kentuckian who had shared the Confederate President's views on aggressive military policies.\n\nDavis gave speeches to soldiers and politicians but largely ignored the common people, who came to resent the favoritism shown to the rich and powerful; Davis thus failed to harness Confederate nationalism. One historian speaks of \"the heavy-handed intervention of the Confederate government.\" Economic intervention, regulation, and state control of manpower, production and transport were much greater in the Confederacy than in the Union. Davis did not use his presidential pulpit to rally the people with stirring rhetoric; he called instead for people to be fatalistic and to die for their new country. Apart from two month-long trips across the country where he met a few hundred people, Davis stayed in Richmond where few people saw him; newspapers had limited circulation, and most Confederates had little favorable information about him.\n\nTo finance the war, the Confederate government initially issued bonds, but investment from the public never met the demands. Taxes were lower than in the Union and collected with less efficiency; European investment was also insufficient. As the war proceeded, both the Confederate government and the individual states printed more and more paper money. Inflation increased from 60% in 1861 to 300% in 1863 and 600% in 1864. Davis did not seem to grasp the enormity of the problem.\n\nIn April 1863, food shortages led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia units from national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.\n\nDavis is widely evaluated as a less effective war leader than Lincoln, even though Davis had extensive military experience and Lincoln had little. Davis would have preferred to be an army general and tended to manage military matters himself. Lincoln and Davis led in very different ways. According to one historian,\n\nThere were many factors that led to Union victory over the Confederacy, and Davis recognized from the start that the South was at a distinct disadvantage; but in the end, Lincoln helped to achieve victory, whereas Davis contributed to defeat.\n\nIn March 1865, General Order 14 provided for enlisting slaves into the army, with a promise of freedom for service. The idea had been suggested years earlier, but Davis did not act upon it until late in the war, and very few slaves were enlisted.\n\nOn April 3, with Union troops under Ulysses S. Grant poised to capture Richmond, Davis escaped to Danville, Virginia, together with the Confederate Cabinet, leaving on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. Lincoln was in Davis's Richmond office just 40 hours later. William T. Sutherlin turned over his mansion, which served as Davis's temporary residence from April 3 to April 10, 1865. On about April 12, Davis received Robert E. Lee's letter announcing surrender. He issued his last official proclamation as president of the Confederacy, and then went south to Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nAfter Lee's surrender, a public meeting was held in Shreveport, Louisiana, at which many speakers supported continuation of the war. Plans were developed for the Davis government to flee to Havana, Cuba. There, the leaders would regroup and head to the Confederate-controlled Trans-Mississippi area by way of the Rio Grande. None of these plans were put into practice.\n\nOn April 14, Lincoln was shot, dying the next day. Davis expressed regret at his death. He later said that he believed Lincoln would have been less harsh with the South than his successor, Andrew Johnson. In the aftermath, Johnson issued a $100,000 reward for the capture of Davis and accused him of helping to plan the assassination. As the Confederate military structure fell into disarray, the search for Davis by Union forces intensified.\n\nPresident Davis met with his Confederate Cabinet for the last time on May 5, 1865, in Washington, Georgia, and officially dissolved the Confederate government. The meeting took place at the Heard house, the Georgia Branch Bank Building, with 14 officials present. Along with their hand-picked escort led by Given Campbell, Davis and his wife Varina Davis were captured by Union forces on May 10 at Irwinville in Irwin County, Georgia.\nMrs. Davis recounted the circumstances of her husband's capture as described below: \"Just before day the enemy charged our camp yelling like demons ... I pleaded with him to let me throw over him a large waterproof wrap which had often served him in sickness during the summer season for a dressing gown and which I hoped might so cover his person that in the grey of the morning he would not be recognized. As he strode off I threw over his head a little black shawl which was around my own shoulders, saying that he could not find his hat and after he started sent my colored woman after him with a bucket for water hoping that he would pass unobserved.\"\n\nIt was reported in the media that Davis put his wife's overcoat over his shoulders while fleeing. This led to the persistent rumor that he attempted to flee in women's clothes, inspiring caricatures that portrayed him as such. Over 40 years later, an article in the \"Washington Herald\" claimed that Mrs. Davis's heavy shawl had been placed on Davis who was \"always extremely sensitive to cold air\", to protect him from the \"chilly atmosphere of the early hour of the morning\" by the slave James Henry Jones, Davis's valet who served Davis and his family during and after the Civil War. Meanwhile, Davis's belongings continued on the train bound for Cedar Key, Florida. They were first hidden at Senator David Levy Yulee's plantation in Florida, then placed in the care of a railroad agent in Waldo. On June 15, 1865, Union soldiers seized Davis's personal baggage from the agent, together with some of the Confederate government's records. A historical marker was erected at this site. In 1939, Jefferson Davis Memorial Historic Site was opened to mark the place where Confederate President Jefferson Davis was captured.\n\nOn May 19, 1865, Davis was imprisoned in a casemate at Fortress Monroe, on the coast of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles, who was in charge of the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the attending physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.\n\nPope Pius IX (see Pope Pius IX and the United States), after learning that Davis was a prisoner, sent him a portrait inscribed with the Latin words \"\"Venite ad me omnes qui laboratis, et ego reficiam vos, dicit Dominus\"\", which correspond to , \"Come to me, all you that labor, and are burdened, and I will refresh you, sayeth the Lord\". A hand-woven crown of thorns associated with the portrait is often said to have been made by the Pope but may have been woven by Davis's wife Varina.\n\nVarina and their young daughter Winnie were allowed to join Davis, and the family was eventually given an apartment in the officers' quarters. Davis was indicted for treason while imprisoned; one of his attorneys was ex-Governor Thomas Pratt of Maryland. There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis. While there was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet to do so, on June 11, 1866 the House of Representatives voted, 105-19, to support such a trial against Davis. Although Davis wanted such a trial for himself, there were no treason trials against anyone, as it was felt they would probably not succeed and would impede reconciliation. There was also a concern at the time that such action could result in a judicial decision that would validate the constitutionality of secession (later removed by the Supreme Court ruling in \"Texas v. White\" (1869) declaring secession unconstitutional).\n\nA jury of 12 black and 12 white men was recruited by United States Circuit Court judge John Curtiss Underwood in preparation for the trial.\n\nAfter two years of imprisonment, Davis was released on bail of $100,000, which was posted by prominent citizens including Horace Greeley, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Gerrit Smith. (Smith was a member of the Secret Six who financially supported abolitionist John Brown.) Davis went to Montreal, Quebec to join his family which had fled there earlier, and lived in Lennoxville, Quebec until 1868, also visiting Cuba and Europe in search of work. At one stage he stayed as a guest of James Smith, a foundry owner in Glasgow, who had struck up a friendship with Davis when he toured the Southern States promoting his foundry business. Davis remained under indictment until Andrew Johnson issued on Christmas Day of 1868 a presidential \"pardon and amnesty\" for the offense of treason to \"every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion\" and after a federal circuit court on February 15, 1869, dismissed the case against Davis after the government's attorney informed the court that he would no longer continue to prosecute Davis.\n\nAfter his release from prison and pardon, Davis faced continued financial pressures, as well as an unsettled family life. His elder brother Joseph died in 1870, his son William Howell Davis in 1872 and Jefferson Davis Jr. in 1878. His wife Varina was often ill or abroad, and for a time refused to live with him in Memphis, Tennessee. Davis resented having to resort to charity, and would only accept jobs befitting his former positions as U.S. Senator and Confederate President; several that he accepted proved financial failures.\n\nOn one of his many trips to England, Davis sought a mercantile position in Liverpool. However, British companies were wary, both because Britons were not interested in Canadian mines, and because Mississippi defaulted on debts in the 1840s, and Judah Benjamin cautioned him against countering former wartime propaganda by Robert J. Walker. Davis also refused positions as head of Randolph-Macon Academy in Virginia and the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, for financial reasons.\n\nIn 1869, Davis became president of the Carolina Life Insurance Company in Memphis, Tennessee, at an annual salary of $12,000, plus travel expenses, and resided at the Peabody Hotel. He recruited former Confederate officers as agents, and the board ratified his position in 1870. By 1873, he suggested that the company have boards of trustees at its various branches, and that qualification for such be that the trustee either take out a policy of at least $5,000 or own at least $1,000 in the company's stock. By midyear the Panic of 1873 affected the company, and Davis resigned when it merged with another firm over his objections. He also planned a \"Davis Land Company\" in which investors would pay $10 per share for 5,700 acres Davis owned in Arkansas. He drafted a prospectus that stated he owed more than $40,000 and his income did not amount to $200.\n\nUpon General Lee's death, Davis agreed to preside over the Presbyterian memorial in Richmond on November 3, 1870. That speech prompted further invitations, although he declined them until July 1871, when he was commencement speaker at the University of the South. Two years later Davis addressed the Virginia Historical Society at White Sulpher Springs, where Davis proclaimed southerners were \"cheated not conquered\" and would never have surrendered if they had foreseen Congressional Reconstruction. In the summer of 1875, Davis agreed to speak at 17 agricultural fairs in the Midwest. He received criticism from the Chicago Tribune and threats to his life in Indiana, but crowds in Kansas City, Missouri and Fairview, Kentucky received him well. During the next two years Davis began writing his books about the Confederacy, but only addressed fellow former soldiers: first veterans of the Mexican War (before which he attacked Congressional Reconstruction), then Confederate veterans (where he promoted reconciliation).\n\nEarly in Reconstruction, Davis publicly remained silent on his opinions, but privately condemned federal military rule and believed Republican authority over former Confederate states unjustified. Mississippi had elected Hiram Rhodes Revels, an African-American, as a U.S. Senator in 1870 to finish the term of Albert G. Brown. Furthermore, during the war, after Joseph Davis's departure from his plantations at Davis Bend and the Union capture of Vicksburg and the surrounding area, General Grant had continued Joseph Davis's utopian experiment and ordered that the land be leased to the freedman and black refugees allowed to settle in the area. Although Joseph Davis ultimately received the land back, many black leaders came from the plantation, which had its own political system, including elected black judges and sheriffs. After the 1867 floods changed the course of the Mississippi River, Joseph Davis sold the plantation to the former slave who had operated a store and handled the white brothers' cotton transaction, Ben Montgomery. Ben's son Isaiah Thornton Montgomery became the first black to hold office in Mississippi when General E.O.C. Ord appointed him Davis Bend's postmaster in 1867. Ben himself was elected justice of the peace. Other black leaders during Mississippi Reconstruction with Davis Bend ties included Israel Shadd, who became speaker of the state's House of Representatives, and legislator Albert Johnson (who also served in the state's constitutional convention).\n\nJefferson Davis considered \"Yankee and Negroe\" rule in the South oppressive, and said so in 1871 and especially after 1873. Like most of his white contemporaries, Davis believed that blacks were inferior to whites. One recent biographer believes Davis favored a Southern social order that included a \"democratic white polity based firmly on dominance of a controlled and excluded black caste\".\n\nWhile seeking to reclaim Davis Bend (\"Hurricane\" and \"Brierfield\" plantations) in 1865, Joseph Davis had filed documents with the Freedmans Bureau insisting that he had intentionally never given Jefferson Davis title to the latter. After receiving first a pardon, and then the lands back, he sold both plantations to former slave Ben Montgomery and his sons, taking back a mortgage for $300,000 at 6% interest, with payments due each January 1 beginning in 1867. While Joseph Davis recognized he could not farm successfully without his 375 enslaved people, he expected the Montgomerys could better manage the labor situation, since in 1865 they had raised nearly 2000 bales of cotton and earned $160,000 in profits. However, when the Mississippi River flooded in spring 1867, it also changed course, ruining many acres and creating \"Davis Island\". After Joseph Davis died two years later, his 1869 will left property to his two orphaned grandchildren, as well as to his brother's children, and named Jefferson Davis one of three executors (with Dr. J. H. D. Bowmar and nephew Joseph Smith). After the Montgomery men entertained the three executors in May 1870, and he suffered losses in the Panic of 1873, Jefferson Davis decided the black men could never fulfill the land purchase contract, and filed suit against the other trustees on June 15, 1874. Jefferson Davis argued his late brother had an oral agreement with Ben Montgomery that allowed Jefferson Davis to rescind the deal and that an unassigned $70,000 from the land sale represented Brierfield's value (the orphaned Hamer grandchildren said it represented declining land values). The local Chancery Court (which then had a Republican judge, and two of the three Hamer lawyers were former Confederates) dismissed Davis's lawsuit in January 1876, citing estoppel, because Davis had been acting as executor for four years despite this claim based on alleged actions in the 1840s. In April 1878 (months after Ben Montgomery had died), the Mississippi Supreme Court overruled the Warren County chancery court, deciding that Jefferson Davis properly claimed the Brierfield land by adverse possession, since he had cleared and farmed it from the 1840s until the outbreak of the Civil War (more than the ten years the statute required). By that time, two of the Republicans on that appellate court had been replaced by Democrats, both former Confederate officers, To actually gain possession of Brierfield, Davis needed to convince the Warren County chancery court to foreclose the mortgage, which happened on June 1, 1880, and all appeals were rejected by December 1, 1881, allowing Jefferson Davis (for the first time in his life), to gain legal title.\n\nWhile pursuing the Brierfield litigation, Davis took another business trip to Liverpool. This time he sought employment from the Royal Insurance Company (a fire and marine insurer) which refused him, citing Northern animosity toward the former Confederate President. Other insurers also rejected him both directly and through intermediaries. He then visited former Confederate ambassador John Slidell in Paris, but was unable to associate with a land company, either to aid the southern people or encourage emigration to the South. Davis returned to the United States and blamed race as the heart of what he called \"the night of despotism\" enveloping the South, citing Republicans who gave political rights to blacks that made them \"more idle and ungovernable than before.\" Davis also investigated mine properties in Arkansas and backed an ice-making machine venture, which failed. He was invited to Texas, but turned down the opportunity to become the first president of the Agriculture and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&M University) in 1876, citing the financial sacrifice (the offered salary was only $4,000/yr). The Mississippi Valley Society, based in England, sought to spur European immigration and English investment, but Davis declined to accept that presidency until salary details had been settled, though he took a speaking tour of the area to drum up public support.\n\nJoseph Davis had encouraged his brother to write his memoirs just after his release from prison, but Davis had responded that he was not capable of doing so, either physically nor emotionally. His wartime assistant Preston Johnston had also encouraged Davis three years later. As Davis began to seriously consider the memoir endeavor in 1869, his early working title became \"Our Cause,\" for he believed he could convert others to the rightness of the Confederacy's actions. In 1875, unable to come to terms with Preston Johnston, Davis authorized William T. Walthall, a former Confederate officer and Carolina Life agent in Mobile, Alabama to look for a publisher for the proposed book. Walthall contacted D. Appleton & Company in New York City, and editor Joseph C. Derby agreed to pay Walthall $250/month as an advance until the manuscript's completion, with the final product not to exceed two volumes of 800 pages each. Davis made minor changes and Appleton agreed.\n\nIn 1877, Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey, a wealthy widow and writer whom he and Varina had known from childhood and who supported the Lost Cause, invited Davis to stay at her estate and plantation house, \"Beauvoir\", which faced the Gulf of Mexico in Biloxi, Mississippi. Her husband, Maryland-born Samuel Dorsey had bought Beauvoir in 1873, and died there two years later. Mrs. Dorsey wanted to provide Davis with a refuge in which he could write his memoirs per the Appleton contract. She provided him a cabin for his own use as well as helped him with his writing through organization, dictation, editing and encouragement. Davis refused to accept overt charity, but agreed to purchase the property at a modest price ($5,500, payable in installments over three years). In January 1878 Dorsey, knowing she too was ill (with breast cancer), made over her will with Walthall's assistance in order to leave her remaining three small Louisiana plantations and financial assets of $50,000 () to Davis and (acknowledging his still-precarious health) if he predeceased her, to his beloved daughter, Winnie Davis. Dorsey died in 1879, by which time both the Davises and Winnie were living at Beauvoir. Her relatives came to contest that last will, which excluded them and gave everything to Davis in fee simple. They argued Davis exerted undue influence over the widow. The court dismissed their lawsuit without comment in March 1880, and they filed no appeal.\n\nUpon receiving the Appleton contract, Davis had sent letters to his former associates, seeking supporting documentation. When Walthall sent two proposed chapters to New York in 1878, Appleton returned them, cautioning that it did not want a long rehash of constitutional history, but rather an account of Davis's actions as the Confederacy's president. The publisher then sent William J. Tenney, a states-rights Democrat and staff member, to visit Beauvoir to get the problematic manuscript into publishable shape. When it still failed to arrive, Derby personally traveled to Mississippi in February 1880. By this time, Derby had advanced $8,000, but Davis confessed that he had seen few pages, asserting that Walthall had the rest. Since Davis did not want to give up on the book nor return the funds (and had already mortgaged the properties he received from Dorsey), he agreed that Tenney would take up residence in a cottage at Beauvoir. On May 1, 1880, Davis severed all connections with Walthall, who had made little progress in the preceding two years. Davis and Tenney then completed \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\" (1881), in two volumes of 700 and 800 pages respectively.\n\nThe Southern Historical Society had been formed in 1876 by Rev. J. William Jones (a Baptist minister and former Confederate chaplain) and Gen. Jubal A. Early. Jones became the Society's paid secretary and editor of the Southern Historical Review; Early became President and head of its executive committee. They made Davis a life member and helped him gather material for his book. They had tried to enlist him for a speaking tour in 1882, but Davis declined, citing his health and a yellow fever epidemic near Beauvoir, and only made one address in New Orleans on its behalf before 1882. Early also began visiting Davis when the Virginian visited New Orleans as supervisor in the Louisiana State Lottery Company. Like Judah Benjamin, Early repeatedly advised Davis not to participate publicly in personal vendettas and old battles, despite critical books and articles by former Confederate Generals Pierre Beauregard and Joseph E. Johnston. Nonetheless, when asked to speak at dedication of the Lee mausoleum in Lexington, Virginia, Davis declined when he learned Johnston would preside, and also vented in his personal correspondence. Davis also took issue with Gen. William T. Sherman in an address in St. Louis in 1884 and in a lengthy letter to the editor, and also criticized young New York politician Theodore Roosevelt for comparing him to Benedict Arnold.\n\nWhen touring the South in 1886 and 1887, Davis attended many Lost Cause ceremonies, and large crowds showered him with affection as local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. According to the \"Meriden Daily Journal\", at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, Davis urged southerners to be loyal to the nation--\"United you are now, and if the Union is ever to be broken, let the other side break it.\" He continued by lauding Confederate men who successfully fought for their own rights despite inferior numbers during the Civil War, and argued that northern historians ignored this view. Davis firmly believed that Confederate secession was constitutional, and was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.\n\nIn the summer of 1888, James Redpath, editor of the North American Review and a former political enemy who became an admirer upon meeting Davis, convinced him to write a series of articles at $250 per article, as well as a book. Davis then completed his final book \"A Short History of the Confederate States of America\" in October 1889.\n\nOn November 6, 1889, Davis left Beauvoir to visit his Brierfield plantation. He embarked a steamboat in New Orleans during sleety rain and fell ill during the trip, so that he initially felt too sick to disembark at his stop, and spent the night upriver in Vicksburg before making his way to the plantation the next day. He refused to send for a doctor for four days before embarking on his return trip. Meanwhile, servants sent Varina a telegram, and she took a train to New Orleans, and then a steamboat upriver, finally reaching the vessel on which her husband was returning. Davis finally received medical care as two doctors came aboard further south and diagnosed acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. Upon arriving in New Orleans three days later, Davis was taken to Garden District home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, a former Confederate officer who became an Associate Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. Fenner was the son-in-law of Davis's old friend J. M. Payne. Davis's doctor Stanford E. Chaille pronounced him too ill to travel to Beauvoir; four medical students who were sons of Confederate veterans and a Catholic nun attended Davis in the Charity Hospital ambulance which took him to the Fenner home. Davis remained bedridden but stable for the next two weeks. He took a turn for the worse in early December. According to Fenner, just when Davis again appeared to be improving, he lost consciousness on the evening of December 5 and died at 12:45 a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, holding Varina's hand and in the presence of several friends.\n\nHis funeral was one of the largest in the South, and New Orleans draped itself in mourning as his body lay in state in the City Hall for several days. An Executive Committee decided to emphasize Davis's ties to the United States, so an American national flag was placed over the Confederate flag during the viewing, and many crossed American and Confederate flags nearby. Davis wore a new suit of Confederate grey fabric Jubal Early had given him, and Varina placed a sword Davis had carried during the Black Hawk War on the bier. A common decoration during the initial funeral was a small American flag in mourning, with a portrait of Davis in the center. The Grand Army of the Republic had a prominent role, even though the Grand Marshall was John G. Glynn, head of the Louisiana National Guard, and Georgia Governor John Gordon (head of the newly organized United Confederate Veterans) was honorary Grand Marshall. While the federal government officially ignored Davis's death, many church bells rang in the south, Confederate veterans held many processions, and Senators and congressmen crossed the Potomac River to join former Confederate officials and generals in eulogizing Davis in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nAlthough initially laid to rest in New Orleans in the Army of Northern Virginia tomb at Metairie Cemetery, in 1893 Davis was reinterred in Richmond, Virginia at Hollywood Cemetery, per his widow's request. Before his death, Davis left the location of his burial up to Varina, but within a day of his death \"The New York Times\" proclaimed Richmond wanted his body. Varina Davis had refused to accept direct charity, but let it be known that she would accept financial help through the Davis Land Company. Soon, many tourists in New Orleans visited the mausoleum. Several other locations in the South wanted Davis's remains. Louisville, Kentucky offered a site in Cave Hill cemetery, noting that two years earlier Davis had dedicated a church built on the site of his birthplace and claiming that he several times said he wanted to be buried in his native state. Memphis, Tennessee, Montgomery, Alabama, Macon and Atlanta, Georgia and both Jackson and Vicksburg, Mississippi also petitioned for Davis's remains. Richmond mayor and Confederate veteran J. Taylor Ellyson established the Jefferson Davis Monument Association, and on July 12, 1891 Varina revealed in a letter to Confederate Veterans and people of the Southern States that her first choice would be Davis's plantation in Mississippi, but that because she feared flooding, she had decided to urge Richmond as the proper place for his tomb.\n\nAfter Davis's remains were exhumed in New Orleans, they lay in state for a day at Memorial Hall of the newly organized Louisiana Historical Association. Those paying final respects included Louisiana Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr.. A continuous cortège, day and night, then accompanied Davis's remains from New Orleans to Richmond. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad car traveled past Beauvoir, then proceeded northeastward toward Richmond, with ceremonies at stops in Mobile and Montgomery, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, then Charlotte and Greensboro, North Carolina. The train also detoured to Raleigh, North Carolina for Davis's coffin to lie in state in that capital city, having been driven by James J. Jones, a free black man who had served Davis during the war and become a local businessman and politician. After a stop in Danville, Virginia, the Confederacy's last capital, and another ceremony at the Virginia State Capital, Davis was then interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Per the association's agreement with Varina, their children's remains were exhumed from Washington, D.C., Memphis and another plot at the Hollywood cemetery, to rest in the new family plot.\n\nA life sized statue of Davis was eventually erected as promised by the Jefferson Davis Monument Association, in cooperation with the Southern Press Davis Monument Association, the United Confederate Veterans and ultimately the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The monument's cornerstone was laid in an 1896 ceremony, and it was dedicated with great pomp and 125,000 spectators on June 3, 1907, the last day of a Confederate reunion. It continues to mark his tomb.\n\nJefferson Davis served in many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, he served as a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, although he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is widely viewed as an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.\n\nSome portions of his legacy were created not as memorials, but as contemporary recognition of his service at the time.\n\nFort Davis National Historic Site began as a frontier military post in October 1854, in the mountains of western Texas. It was named after then-United States Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. That fort gave its name to the surrounding Davis Mountains range, and the town of Fort Davis. The surrounding area was designated Jeff Davis County in 1887, with the town of Fort Davis as the county seat. Other states containing a Jefferson (or Jeff) Davis County/Parish include Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\n\nJefferson Davis Hospital began operations in 1924 and was the first centralized municipal hospital to treat indigent patients in Houston, Texas. The building was designated as a protected historic landmark on November 13, 2013, by the Houston City Council and is monitored by the Historic Preservation Office of the City of Houston Department of Planning and Development. The hospital was named for Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederacy, in honor of the Confederate soldiers who had been buried in the cemetery and as a means to console the families of the deceased.\n\nNumerous memorials to Jefferson Davis were created. The largest is the concrete obelisk located at the Jefferson Davis State Historic Site in Fairview, marking his birthplace. Construction of the monument began in 1917 and finished in 1924 at a cost of about $200,000.\n\nIn 1913, the United Daughters of the Confederacy conceived the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, a transcontinental highway to be built through the South. Portions of the highway's route in Virginia, Alabama and other states still bear the name of Jefferson Davis. However, in Alexandria, Virginia, the city council voted unanimously to rename the highway and has solicited public suggestions for a new name.\n\nDavis appeared on several postage stamps issued by the Confederacy, including its first postage stamp (issued in 1861). In 1995, his portrait appeared on a United States postage stamp, part of a series of 20 stamps commemorating the 130th anniversary of the end of the Civil War. Davis was also celebrated on the 6-cent Stone Mountain Memorial Carving commemorative on September 19, 1970, at Stone Mountain, Georgia. The stamp portrayed Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson on horseback. It depicts a replica of the actual memorial, carved into the side of Stone Mountain at above ground level, the largest high-relief sculpture in the world.\n\nThe Jefferson Davis Presidential Library was established at Beauvoir in 1998. For some years, the white-columned Biloxi mansion that was Davis's final home had served as a Confederate Veterans Home. The house and library were damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005; the house reopened in 2008. Bertram Hayes-Davis, Davis's great-great grandson, is the executive director of Beauvoir, which is owned by the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.\n\nBased at Rice University in Houston, Texas, \"The Papers of Jefferson Davis\" is an editing project to publish documents related to Davis. Since the early 1960s, it has published 13 volumes, the first in 1971 and the most recent in 2012; two more volumes are planned. The project has roughly 100,000 documents in its archives.\nThe birthday of Jefferson Davis is commemorated in several states. His actual birthday, June 3, is celebrated in Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee; in Alabama, it is celebrated on the first Monday in June. In Mississippi, the last Monday of May (Memorial Day) is celebrated as \"National Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis's Birthday\". In Texas, \"Confederate Heroes Day\" is celebrated on January 19, the birthday of Robert E. Lee; Jefferson Davis's birthday had been officially celebrated on June 3 but was combined with Lee's birthday in 1973.\n\nRobert E. Lee's United States citizenship was posthumously restored in 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well. This was accomplished with the passing of Senate Joint Resolution 16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter referred to this as the last act of reconciliation in the Civil War.\n\nIn films and on television, Jefferson Davis has been portrayed by,\nBULLET::::- Erville Alderson in\nBULLET::::- \"Hearts in Bondage\" (1936)\nBULLET::::- \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940)\nBULLET::::- Charles Middleton in \"Virginia City\" (1940)\nBULLET::::- Morris Ankrum in \"Tennessee Johnson\" (1942)\nBULLET::::- Lloyd Bridges in \"North and South\" (1985)\nBULLET::::- Brian Paulette in \"\" (2004)\nBULLET::::- John Rothman in \"\" (2012)\n\n\nBULLET::::- Allen, Felicity (1999). \"Jefferson Davis: Unconquerable Heart\".

{"id": "16135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16135", "title": "Jonathan Meades", "text": "Jonathan Meades\n\nJonathan Turner Meades (born 21 January 1947) is an English writer and film-maker, primarily on the subjects of place, culture, architecture and food. His work spans journalism, fiction, essays, memoir and over fifty highly idiosyncratic television films, and has been described as \"brainy, scabrous, mischievous,\" \"iconoclastic\" and possessed of \"a polymathic breadth of knowledge and truly caustic wit\".\n\nHis latest film, \"Franco Building with Jonathan Meades\", aired on BBC Four on 27 August 2019 and is the fourth instalment in a series on the architectural legacy of 20th-century European dictators. A new anthology of uncollected writing from the last thirty years, \"Pedro and Ricky Come Again,\" is currently crowdfunding at Unbound.\n\nHe has described himself as a \"cardinal of atheism\" and is both an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Patron of Humanists UK.\n\nJonathan Meades was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the only child of John William Meades, a biscuit company sales rep, and Margery Agnes Meades (\"née\" Hogg), a primary school teacher. The family lived in an \"unbelievably cramped\" terraced, thatched cottage in the East Harnham area of the city and Meades was educated until the age of 13 at the nearby Salisbury Cathedral School, within Salisbury Cathedral Close.\n\nHe discovered a fascination for place and the built environment whilst accompanying his father on sales trips during school holidays; he would be left unattended and free to explore while the elder Meades conducted his business with the grocer. This later developed into a full-blown passion for architecture following a visit to Edwin Lutyens' Marsh Court on a school cricket trip at the age of 13. He also developed an early love of France on the frequent trips which his family took there, made possible by his Francophile mother's father, who worked for Southern Railway, the company which ran the Saint-Malo and Le Havre ferries.\n\nIn 1960 he was sent as a boarder to King's College, Taunton, which he described as \"a dim, backward, muscular Christian boot camp\". He later \"walked out\" of the school and was sent instead to a crammer in London, where he lodged with the painter Vivien White, daughter of Augustus John.\n\nAfter a year at the University of Bordeaux and unsure of what to do next, he decided to become an actor after a chance meeting with Charles Collingwood and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1966 to 1969. His contemporaries there included Robert Lindsay, David Bradley, Stephanie Beacham, Michael Kitchen and Richard Beckinsale. He later described it as a \"Sandhurst for chorus boys\" where students were \"martially drilled,\" teaching them the value of discipline, craft and technique. Although he ultimately decided against joining the acting profession, the training which he received would prove essential in his later television career, as would his extra-curricular interest in French New Wave cinema, in particular the work of Jean-Pierre Melville and Alain Robbe-Grillet. His regular Sunday pastime of exploring the capital with his \"Pevsner Architectural Guide\" would also benefit him later. On leaving RADA, he was told by the Principal, Hugh Cruttwell, that he might as well abandon acting until he reached middle age, at which point he might become an interesting character actor. When the two met again decades later, after Meades had established himself on television, Cruttwell joked that he hadn't realised that the character would be called \"Jonathan Meades\".\n\nFollowing a period as a freelance designer and copywriter, Meades began writing for the now-defunct literary magazine \"Books & Bookmen\" in 1971, setting him on a career as a journalist and critic. In 1973 he reviewed a V&A exhibition on Victorian architecture for the magazine, igniting a passion for the style and prompting him to explore even more of London than he had to date. Using the unlimited travel afforded by Red Rover bus passes, he rode on random buses for exactly 20 minutes and then got off, no matter where he was. After leaving \"Books and Bookmen\" in 1975 he wrote for the sex education magazine \"Curious\" and joined the staff of \"Time Out\", then became \"The Observer\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> TV critic in 1977. This led to the publication of his first book, \"This Is Their Life\", an A to Z of TV star biographies with an introduction by Mike Yarwood. He moved to \"Architects' Journal\" in 1979 and around this time worked on another book, \"The Illustrated Atlas of the World's Great Buildings\", with Philip Bagenal.\n\nIn 1981 he became the editor of Richard Branson's short-lived listings magazine \"Event\", then from 1982 was the features editor of \"Tatler\". It was here that he first had the opportunity to write about food, filling in as restaurant critic after Julian Barnes resigned, using the pseudonym \"John Beaver\". He was also invited to contribute to the bi-monthly restaurant magazine \"À la Carte\" at around this time. In 1986 he was offered the job of restaurant critic at \"The Times\", replacing comedy writer Stan Hey, and was a great success, taking the job more seriously than his predecessor and winning Best Food Journalist at the 1986, 1990, 1996 and 1999 Glenfiddich Awards. \n\nDespite his success, he often tired of the repetitive nature of the job and threatened to leave several times. The paper responded by increasing his salary. He finally quit in around 2000, having been pronounced morbidly obese by his doctor: he had put on around five pounds per year, or one ounce per meal, during his tenure. He then managed to lose a third of his body weight over the course of the following twelve months using a strict diet of protein and citrus. He remained with \"The Times\" as a columnist until 2005.\n\nIn the years since, he has done less journalism, but has contributed essays and reviews to numerous publications including the \"New Statesman\", \"The Independent\", \"The Guardian\", \"The Spectator\", \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", and many others.\n\nIn 1982, \"Harpers & Queen\" published three short stories which Meades had written about \"rural lowlife\". These, along with four more, were collected in 1984 as \"Filthy English\", his first volume of fiction. Andrew Billen of the \"London Evening Standard\" later described them as \"bucolic horror stories\". A few more stories appeared in his first anthology of journalism and essays, 1989's \"Peter Knows What Dick Likes\", the title of which is a reference to the supposed superiority of male-on-male fellatio.\n\nHe contributed to the screenplay of the 1992 French-Italian adventure film \"L'Atlantide\", directed by Bob Swaim, and also wrote three unproduced screenplays in the 1980s and '90s: \"Millie's Problem\" (1985), \"The Side I Dressed On\" (1987) and \"The Brute's Price\" (1996).\n\nHis first novel, \"Pompey\", was published in 1993. A dark, epic family saga centred around the titular city of Portsmouth, it was widely praised and favourably compared to Sterne, Scarfe, Steadman, Nabokov and Joyce, amongst other \"great stylists\". On its 2013 reissue, Matthew Adams wrote in \"The Independent\", \"Where his first collection of stories, \"Filthy English\", achieved the distinction of covering in aggressively vivid prose the disciplines of murder, addiction, incest and bestial pornography, \"Pompey\" exhibits an even greater concentration of his aptitude for squalor [...] by the end of the opening two pages, which must rank among the most startling affirmations of omniscience in 20th-century literature, the reader has met with an arresting injunction: \"After using this book please wash your hands.\"\"\n\nA second novel, \"The Fowler Family Business\", followed in 2002. A tale of suburban sexual deceit in the funeral trade, it was described by the \"London Evening Standard\" as \"hilarious and very black\". An anthology of his food journalism, \"Incest and Morris Dancing: A Gastronomic Revolution\", was published in the same year.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with \"The Arts Desk\", he revealed that he was working on a third novel.\n\nAn anthology of journalism, essays and TV scripts on the built environment, \"Museum Without Walls\", was published by the crowdfunded imprint Unbound in 2012.\n\nMeades' memoir of his childhood in the 1950s and early 1960s, \"An Encyclopaedia of Myself\", was published in May 2014. It was long-listed for that year's Samuel Johnson Prize and won Best Memoir in the Spear's Book Awards 2014. Roger Lewis of the \"Financial Times\" said of the work that \"If this book is thought of less as a memoir than as a symphonic poem about post-war England and Englishness – well, then it is a masterpiece.\"\n\nIn 2015, the publisher and record label Test Centre released a spoken word vinyl album by Meades entitled \"Pedigree Mongrel\", consisting of readings from \"Pompey\", \"Museum Without Walls\", \"An Encyclopaedia of Myself\" and unpublished fiction, combined with soundscapes created by Mordant Music. The sleeve of the album featured photography by Meades, including an abstract self-portrait on the front cover.\n\nA book of \"borrowed\" recipes, \"The Plagiarist in the Kitchen\", was published by Unbound in 2017. According to Meades, it is \"devoted to the idea that you shouldn't try and invent anything in the kitchen, just rely on what has already been done [...] I hate the idea of experimental cookery, but I like the idea of experimental literature.\n\nIn March 2018, Unbound launched a funding campaign for a new anthology of uncollected journalism and essays entitled \"Pedro and Ricky Come Again\". It is described as \"the best of three decades of Jonathan Meades\" and as the sequel to \"Peter Knows What Dick Likes\".\n\n\"Isle of Rust\", a collaboration with the photographer Alex Boyd featuring text based on Meades' script for his 2009 film about Lewis and Harris, will be published by Luath Press on 19 December 2019.\n\nMeades' first foray into television was in 1985: a short film on the art and architecture of Barcelona for the BBC Two arts magazine programme \"Saturday Review\". His first major project was the 1987 six-part Channel 4 architectural documentary series \"The Victorian House\". This contained many stylistic similarities to his other work, but the producer of the series, John Marshall, received the sole writing credit and it was not a happy experience for Meades. He would be credited as the sole author of all his subsequent work.\n\nHis next series was \"Abroad in Britain\", broadcast on BBC Two in 1990. It featured five irreverent, \"slightly bonkers\" films which explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment: informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with Utopianism, bohemians and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being \"devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home.\" The series was influenced by the work of architectural critic Ian Nairn and French New Wave film director Alain Robbe-Grillet, and it cemented Meades' uniquely incongruous on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and surreal interludes. Preferring to be thought of as a performer rather than as a presenter, he described his style as \"heavy entertainment\"; \"staged essays\" which sought to combine \"lecture hall\" and \"music hall\", \"Geoffrey Hill\" and \"Benny Hill\". \nRachel Cooke of \"The Guardian\" later described his TV persona as \"pugnacious, sardonic and seemingly super-confident\", while noting the RADA training and that it was \"not the real Jonathan Meades, who is an altogether more diffident and shy character [...] except when drunk\". The series spawned four sequels: \"Further Abroad\" (1994), \"Even Further Abroad\" (1997), \"Abroad Again in Britain\" (2005) and \"Abroad Again\" (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films, the majority of which have been archived on the website \"MeadesShrine\".\n\nThe 1998 film \"Heart By-Pass\" looked affectionately at Birmingham; particularly at how its architecture, transport system and ethnic mix have changed since the 1960s. It featured the music of many of the city's best-known '60s and '70s rock bands such as The Moody Blues, The Move, Traffic, Black Sabbath and ELO.\n\nHe made two films on the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner. The first, in 1998, was the Worcestershire episode of the series \"Travels with Pevsner\", in which noted writers followed his guide books on particular counties. The second, in 2001, was a biography entitled \"Pevsner Revisited\".\n\nMeades made two other stand-alone films which aired earlier in 2001: \"Victoria Died in 1901 and is Still Alive Today\" examined the other-worldly legacy of Victorian architecture and culture one hundred years on, to a soundtrack of late 1960s psychedelic rock by artists such as The Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Pink Floyd; \"suRREAL FILM\" (or \"tvSSFBM EHKL\", the letters of the title moved forwards then backwards) sought to expound on surrealism in a manner befitting the subject, whilst reflecting on, \"inter alia\", the fact that Meades had recently lost a considerable amount of weight. Both films featured the comic actor Christopher Biggins, notably as Queen Victoria herself, and were the first of Meades' films to be directed by Francis Hanly, who would go on to be his main collaborator, directing and shooting virtually all of his films from 2008 onwards.\n\nA three-part series on food culture, \"Meades Eats\", aired on BBC Four in 2003, again featuring Biggins and Hanly. The episodes dealt with fast food, the notion of a gastronomic revolution in the UK and with the ever-increasing influence of immigrant cuisines.\n\nThe 2008 two-part BBC Four film \"Jonathan Meades: Magnetic North\" celebrated the culture of Northern Europe, examining why the North suffers in the British popular imagination in comparison with the South. Meades travelled from the slag heaps of northern France to Belgian cities, the red-light district of Hamburg, Gdańsk, the Baltic States and finally Helsinki, musing on the architecture, food and art of the places he visited. Writing in \"The Daily Telegraph\", James Walton praised the programme as \"Sparkling, thought-provoking, constantly challenging the accepted view, Meades seemed at times inspired, at others deranged. The only thing he never was, thank heaven, was obvious.\"\n\nA 9-DVD box set collecting all of his BBC work to date was planned for release in April 2008, but was reduced to a 3-disc anthology due to the expense of licensing the music used in the programmes. Much of the carefully chosen popular music used in the original edits was replaced by library music, and the more music-dependent films such as \"Surreal Film\", \"Victoria Died in 1901\" and \"Heart By-Pass\" were not included.\n\nIn 2009, Meades toured Scotland in a three-part BBC Four series entitled \"Jonathan Meades: Off Kilter\". He visited Aberdeen, Lewis and Harris (the 'Isle of Rust') and the less-renowned footballing towns of south-west Fife, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk, guided by his foul-mouthed 'ScotNav'.\n\nIn 2012, BBC Four screened \"Jonathan Meades on France\", a series in which he explored what he called his \"second country\". The first episode, \"Fragments of an Arbitrary Encyclopaedia\", focused on the Lorraine region, using a miscellany of words beginning with the letter V. The second episode, \"A Biased Anthology of Parisian Peripheries\", focused on Frenchness and its major traits. The series concluded with \"Just a Few Debts France Owes to America\".\n\nThe 2013 film \"The Joy of Essex\" examined that county's little-known history of utopian communities.\n\nA two-part series on Brutalist architecture, \"Bunkers, Brutalism and Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry\", aired in 2014.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with \"The Guardian\", Meades quoted his director, Francis Hanly, on how their production budgets had declined over the years: \"We used to be a convoy, now we are a Smart car\". In a 2008 interview with \"The Independent\", he indicated that the blame for this lay mostly with former BBC Two controller Jane Root.\n\n\"Jonathan Meades on Jargon\" aired on BBC Four in May 2018. The BBC Four website described it as a \"provocative television essay\" which \"dissects politics, the law, football commentary, business, the arts, tabloid-speak and management consultancy to show how jargon is used to cover up, confuse and generally keep us in the dark.\" \"The Guardian\" described it as \"blisteringly brutal, clever and hilarious,\" while \"The Times\" also declared Meades to be \"on blistering form.\"\n\nOver a period of 25 years, Meades has written and presented four films on the architectural legacy of 20th-century European dictators, the latest of which, \"Franco Building with Jonathan Meades\", looking at Franco's Spain, aired in August 2019. The previous instalments were \"Jerry Building\" (Nazi Germany, 1994), \"Joe Building\" (Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, 2006) and \"Ben Building\" (Benito Mussolini's Italy, 2016).\n\nMeades entered the world of photography with the 2013 collection \"Pidgin Snaps\". Published by Unbound as a \"boxette\" of 100 postcards, it featured mostly abstract digital work. It was followed in April 2016 by an exhibition entitled \"Ape Forgets Medication: Treyfs and Artknacks\" at the Londonewcastle Project in Shoreditch, London. A second exhibition, \"After Medication: Random Treyfs and Artknacks\" was held in October 2017 at 108 Fine Art, Harrogate.\n\nMeades has been married three times and has four daughters from his first two marriages. In 1980 he married Sally Brown, director of the British Theatre Association, and the couple had twins. His second wife was Frances Bentley, managing editor of \"Vogue\", whom he married in 1988. They had two daughters and divorced in 1997. In 2003 he married his girlfriend Colette Forder, a colleague from \"The Times\". In around 2007, the couple sold their penthouse flat on Tyers Gate, off Bermondsey Street, Southwark, where they had lived for 10 years, and moved to a converted mill near Bordeaux. Discovering that they found country life boring, they then moved to Marseille in around 2011, where they live in Le Corbusier's Unité d'habitation apartment block.\n\nDuring his time at RADA, he became friends with the painter Duggie Fields, whose flatmate was the former Pink Floyd singer, songwriter and guitarist Syd Barrett. He was also friendly with Aubrey \"Po\" Powell, co-founder of the graphic design company Hipgnosis, most famous for its Pink Floyd album covers. He has described himself as \"a hanger-on to the hangers-on\" around the band and has admitted to taking LSD three times, describing it as \"the only remotely interesting drug\".\n\nMeades was called \"the best amateur chef in the world\" by Marco Pierre White.

{"id": "16139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16139", "title": "Joe Pass", "text": "Joe Pass\n\nJoe Pass (born Joseph Anthony Jacobi Passalaqua; January 13, 1929 – May 23, 1994) was an American jazz guitarist of Sicilian descent. He is considered one of the greatest jazz guitarists of the 20th century. He created possibilities for jazz guitar through his style of chord-melody, his knowledge of chord inversions and progressions, and his use of walking basslines and counterpoint during improvisation. Pass worked often with pianist Oscar Peterson and vocalist Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nBorn in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Joe Pass was the son of Mariano Passalaqua, a Sicilian-born steel mill worker. He was raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. He received his first guitar, a Harmony, on his ninth birthday. His father recognized early that his son had \"a little something happening\" and pushed him to learn tunes by ear, practice scales, play pieces written for other instruments, and to fill in the space between the notes of the melody.\n\nAs early as 14, Pass started getting jobs performing. He played with bands led by Tony Pastor and Charlie Barnet, honing his guitar skills while learning about the music business. He began traveling with small jazz groups and moved from Pennsylvania to New York City. Within a few years he had developed an addiction to heroin, and spent much of the 1950s in prison. He eventually recovered after a two-and-a-half-year stay in the Synanon rehabilitation program. During that time he \"didn't do a lot of playing\". In 1962 he recorded \"Sounds of Synanon\". Around this time he received his trademark Gibson ES-175 guitar as a gift, which he used on tours and records for many years.\n\n Pass recorded a series of albums during the 1960s for Pacific Jazz Records, including \"Catch Me,\" \"12-String Guitar,\" \"For Django,\" and \"Simplicity.\" In 1963, he received \"Downbeat\" magazine's New Star Award. \nHe was also played on Pacific Jazz recordings by Gerald Wilson, Bud Shank, and Les McCann. He toured with George Shearing in 1965. During the 1960s, he did mostly TV and recording session work in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was a sideman for Louie Bellson, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Della Reese, Johnny Mathis, and worked on the TV shows \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" \"The Merv Griffin Show,\" and \"The Steve Allen Show\". In the early 1970s, he and guitarist Herb Ellis performed together regularly at Donte's jazz club in Los Angeles. This collaboration led to Pass and Ellis recording the first album on Concord Jazz entitled \"Jazz/Concord\" with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Jake Hanna. In the early 1970s, Pass collaborated on a series of music books, and his \"Joe Pass Guitar Style\" (written with Bill Thrasher) is considered a leading improvisation textbook for students of jazz.\n\nNorman Granz, the producer of Jazz at the Philharmonic and the founder of Verve Records, signed Pass to Pablo Records in 1970. In 1974, Pass released his solo album \"Virtuoso\" on Pablo. Also in 1974, Pablo released the album \"The Trio\" with Pass, Oscar Peterson, and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. He performed with them on many occasions throughout the 1970s and 1980s. At the Grammy Awards of 1975, \"The Trio\" won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. As part of the Pablo roster, Pass recorded with Benny Carter, Milt Jackson, Herb Ellis, Zoot Sims, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Count Basie.\n\nPass and Ella Fitzgerald recorded six albums together on Pablo toward the end of Fitzgerald's career: \"Take Love Easy\" (1973), \"Fitzgerald and Pass... Again\" (1976), \"Hamburg Duets - 1976\" (1976), \"Sophisticated Lady\" (1975, 1983), \"Speak Love\" (1983), and \"Easy Living\" (1986).\n\nIn 1994, Joe Pass died from liver cancer in Los Angeles, California at the age of 65. Before his death, he recorded an album of Hank Williams songs with country guitarist Roy Clark.\n\nSpeaking about \"Nuages: Live at Yoshi's, Volume 2,\" Jim Ferguson wrote:\n\nThe follow up to 1993's \"Joe Pass & Co. Live at Yoshi's,\" this release was colored by sad circumstances: both bassist Monty Budwig and Pass were stricken with fatal illnesses. Nevertheless, all concerned, including drummer Colin Bailey and second guitarist John Pisano, play up to their usual high levels...Issued posthumously, this material is hardly sub-standard. Bristling with energy throughout, it helps document the final stages in the career of a player who, arguably, was the greatest mainstream guitarist since Wes Montgomery.\n\n \"New York\" magazine said of him, \"Joe Pass looks like somebody's uncle and plays guitar like nobody's business. He's called 'the world's greatest' and often compared to Paganini for his virtuosity. There is a certain purity to his sound that makes him stand out easily from other first-rate jazz guitarists.\" His solo style was marked by an advanced linear technique, sophisticated harmonic sense, counterpoint between improvised lead lines, bass figures and chords, spontaneous modulations, and transitions from fast tempos to rubato passages. He would add what he called \"color tones\" to his compositions to give what he believed was a more sophisticated and funkier sound. He would often use counterpoint during improvisation, move lines and chords chromatically, or play melodies by shifting chords and descending augmented arpeggios at the end of phrases.\n\nPass's early style (influenced by guitarist Django Reinhardt and saxophonist Charlie Parker), was marked by fast single-note lines. He would break his guitar picks, playing only with the smaller part. As he made the transition from ensemble to solo guitar, he abandoned the pick to play fingerstyle. He found this enabled him to execute his harmonic concepts more effectively.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Mel Bay Presents Joe Pass \"Off the Record.\"\" Mel Bay, 1993.\nBULLET::::- \"Complete Joe Pass.\" Mel Bay, 2003.\nBULLET::::- Miyakaku, Takao. \"Joe Pass.\" Tokyo: Seiunsha, 2000.

{"id": "16141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16141", "title": "Jazz guitar", "text": "Jazz guitar\n\nThe term jazz guitar may refer to either a type of guitar or to the variety of guitar playing styles used in the various genres which are commonly termed \"jazz\". The jazz-type guitar was born as a result of using electric amplification to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars.\n\nConceived in the early 1930s, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud big bands. When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play chords; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument. Once guitarists switched from acoustic guitar to semi-acoustic guitar and began using guitar amplifiers, it made the guitar much easier to hear, which enabled guitarists to play guitar solos. Jazz guitar had an important influence on jazz in the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic and acoustic guitars are still sometimes used in jazz, most jazz guitarists since the 1940s have performed on an electrically amplified guitar or electric guitar.\n\nTraditionally, jazz electric guitarists use an archtop with a relatively broad hollow sound-box, violin-style f-holes, a \"floating bridge\", and a magnetic pickup. Solid body guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.\n\nJazz guitar playing styles include \"comping\" with jazz chord voicings (and in some cases walking bass lines) and \"blowing\" (improvising) over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments. Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations. When jazz guitar players improvise, they may use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression and elements of the tune's melody.\n\nThe stringed, chord-playing rhythm can be heard in groups which included military band-style instruments such as brass, saxes, clarinets, and drums, such as early jazz groups. As the acoustic guitar became a more popular instrument in the early 20th century, guitar-makers began building louder guitars which would be useful in a wider range of settings.\n\nThe Gibson L5, an acoustic archtop guitar which was first produced in 1923, was an early “jazz”-style guitar which was used by early jazz guitarists such as Eddie Lang. By the 1930s, the guitar began to displace the banjo as the primary chordal rhythm instrument in jazz music, because the guitar could be used to voice chords of greater harmonic complexity, and it had a somewhat more muted tone that blended well with the upright bass, which, by this time, had almost completely replaced the tuba as the dominant bass instrument in jazz music.\n\nDuring the late 1930s and through the 1940s—the heyday of big band jazz and swing music—the guitar was an important rhythm section instrument. Some guitarists, such as Freddie Green of Count Basie’s band, developed a guitar-specific style of accompaniment. Few of the big bands, however, featured amplified guitar solos, which were done instead in the small combo context. The most important jazz guitar soloists of this period included the Manouche virtuoso Django Reinhardt, Oscar Moore who was featured with Nat “King” Cole’s trio, and Charlie Christian of Benny Goodman's band and sextet, who was a major influence despite his early death at 25.\n\nIt was not until the large-scale emergence of small combo jazz in the post-WWII period that the guitar took off as a versatile instrument, which was used both in the rhythm section and as a featured melodic instrument and solo improviser. In the hands of George Barnes, Kenny Burrell, Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Jimmy Raney, and Tal Farlow, who had absorbed the language of bebop, the guitar began to be seen as a “serious” jazz instrument. Improved electric guitars such as Gibson’s ES-175 (released in 1949), gave players a larger variety of tonal options. In the 1940s through the 1960s, players such as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, and Jim Hall laid the foundation of what is now known as \"jazz guitar\" playing.\n\nAs jazz-rock fusion emerged in the early 1970s, many players switched to the more rock-oriented solid body guitars. Other jazz guitarists, like Grant Green and Wes Montgomery, turned to applying their skills to pop-oriented styles that fused jazz with soul and R&B, such as soul jazz-styled organ trios. Younger jazz musicians rode the surge of electric popular genres such as blues, rock, and funk to reach new audiences. Guitarists in the fusion realm fused the post-bop harmonic and melodic language of musicians such as John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Ornette Coleman, and Miles Davis with a hard-edged (and usually very loud) rock tone created by guitarists such as Cream's Eric Clapton who had redefined the sound of the guitar for those unfamiliar with the black blues players of Chicago and, before that, the Delta region of the Mississippi upon whom his style was based. With John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, Clapton turned up the volume on a sound already pioneered by Buddy Guy, Freddie King, B.B. King and others that was fluid, with heavy finger vibratos, string bending, and speed through powerful Marshall amplifiers.\n\nFusion players such as John McLaughlin adopted the fluid, powerful sound of rock guitarists such as Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. McLaughlin was a master innovator, incorporating hard jazz with the new sounds of Clapton, Hendrix, Beck and others. McLaughlin later formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra, an historically important fusion band that played to sold out venues in the early 1970s and as a result, produced an endless progeny of fusion guitarist. Guitarists such as Pat Martino, Al Di Meola, Larry Coryell, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and Mike Stern (the latter two both alumni of the Miles Davis band) fashioned a new language for the guitar which introduced jazz to a new generation of fans. Like the rock-blues icons that preceded them, fusion guitarists usually played their solid body instruments through stadium rock-style amplification, and signal processing \"effects\" such as simulated distortion, wah-wah, octave splitters, compression, and flange pedals. They also simply turned up to full volume in order to create natural overdrive such as the blues rock players.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the radical experiments of early 1970s-era fusion gave way to a more radio-friendly sounds of smooth jazz. Guitarist Pat Metheny mixed the sounds of blues, country, and “world” music, along with rock and jazz, playing both a flat-top acoustic guitar and an electric guitar with a softer, more mellow tone which was sweetened with a shimmering effect known as “chorusing\". During the 1980s, a neo-traditional school of jazz sought to reconnect with the past. In keeping with such an aesthetic, young guitarists of this era sought a clean and round tone, and they often played traditional hollow-body arch-top guitars without electronic effects, frequently through vacuum tube amplifiers.\n\nAs players such as Bobby Broom, Peter Bernstein, Howard Alden, Russell Malone, and Mark Whitfield revived the sounds of traditional jazz guitar, there was also a resurgence of archtop luthierie (guitar-making). By the early 1990s many small independent luthiers began making archtop guitars. In the 2000s, jazz guitar playing continues to change. Some guitarists incorporate a Latin jazz influence, acid jazz-style dance club music uses samples from Wes Montgomery, and guitarists such as Bill Frisell continue to defy categorization.\n\n While jazz can be played on any type of guitar, from an acoustic instrument to a solid-bodied electric guitar such as a Fender Stratocaster, the full-depth archtop guitar has become known as the prototypical \"jazz guitar.\" Archtop guitars are steel-string acoustic guitars with a big soundbox, arched top, violin-style f-holes, a \"floating bridge\" and magnetic or piezoelectric pickups. Early makers of jazz guitars included Gibson, Epiphone, D'Angelico and Stromberg. The electric guitar is plugged into a guitar amplifier to make it sound loud enough for performance. Guitar amplifiers have equalizer controls that allow the guitarist to change the tone of the instrument, by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequency bands. The use of reverb effects, which are often included in guitar amplifiers, has long been part of the jazz guitar sound. Particularly since the 1970s jazz fusion era, some jazz guitarists have also used effects pedals such as overdrive pedals, chorus pedals and wah pedals.\n\nThe earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic, later superseded by a typical electric configuration of two humbucking pickups. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest among jazz guitarists in acoustic archtop guitars with floating pickups. The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume: for that reason they were constructed for use with relatively heavy guitar strings. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists continued to fit strings of 0.012\" gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer flatwound strings. The characteristic arched top can be made of a solid piece of wood that is carved into the arched shape, or a piece of laminated wood (essentially a type of plywood) that is pressed into shape. Spruce is often used for tops, and maple for backs. Archtop guitars can be mass-produced, such as the Ibanez Artcore series, or handmade by luthiers such as Robert Benedetto.\n\nBULLET::::- The Selmer-Maccaferri guitar is strongly associated with Django Reinhardt and gypsy swing.\nBULLET::::- The resonator guitar was used (but not exclusively) by Oscar Aleman.\nBULLET::::- Nylon string guitars are associated with Latin jazz, for instance in the work of Charlie Byrd and Laurindo Almeida.\nBULLET::::- Flat-top steel-string guitars (particularly Ovation guitars) have been used in the \"acoustic shredding\" of John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell and Al Di Meola.\nBULLET::::- Solid-body electric guitars have been used in Jazz-rock, for instance by Bill Frisell and Stanley Jordan.

In 4/4 timing, it is common to play 2.5 beat intervals such as on the 2 and then the half beat or \"and\" after 4. Jazz guitarists may play chords \"ahead\" of the beat, by playing the chord a swung eighth note before the actual chord change. Chords are not generally played in a repetitive rhythmic fashion, like a rock rhythm guitarist would play.\n\nJazz guitarists use their knowledge of harmony and jazz theory to create jazz chord \"voicings,\" which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. In some modern jazz styles, dominant 7th chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 9th\", or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 9th\"); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a \"sharp 11th\"); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a \"flat 13th\").\n\nJazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including major 7th, major 6th, minor 7th, minor/major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and augmented chords. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as \"alt dominant chords\" described above), chord substitutions, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a walking bass-style accompaniment.\n\nJazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different chord progressions used in jazz, such as the ubiquitous ii-V-I progression, the jazz-style blues progression (which, in contrast to a blues-style 12 bar progression, may have two or more chord changes per bar) the minor jazz-style blues form, the I-vi-ii-V based \"rhythm changes\" progression, and the variety of modulation-rich chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and jazz standards. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and effects pedals (e.g., chorus effect or fuzzbox) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.\n\nJazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and \"timefeel\" that creates a sense of \"swing\" and \"groove.\" The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different \"timefeels\" such as playing \"ahead of the beat\" or \"behind the beat,\" to create or release tension.\n\nAnother aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era. Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as Wes Montgomery's borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use \"guide tones\" and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and usage of pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists used Jimi Hendrix-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as tapping and tremolo bar bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a \"shred\" style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.\n\nWhen jazz guitar players improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised \"by ear\" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play \"by ear.\" Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios. Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of \"licks\", melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players.\n\nIn jazz big bands, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, drums and bass). They usually played a regular four strums to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. Freddie Green, guitarist in the Count Basie orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the root note is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.\n\nWhen jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations, it is called \"comping\", short for \"accompanying\" The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of inversions when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.\n\nIn this style, the guitarist aims to render an entire song — harmony, melody and bass — in something like the way a classical guitarist or pianist can. Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase. The denser chordal textures, in contrast, approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a country, folk or ragtime background, such as Chet Atkins, although it is also sometimes employed by straight-ahead jazz practitioners, for instance Martin Taylor. Chord-melody is often played with a plectrum (see Tal Farlow, George Benson and others); whereas fingerstyle, as practised by Joe Pass, George van Eps, Ted Greene, Robert Conti, Lenny Breau or hybrid picking as practised by Ed Bickert, Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, polyphonic approach to unaccompanied soloing.\n\nCharlie Christian and Django Reinhardt are generally held to have initiated the use of the guitar to play melodies and improvisations over other instruments, the former using an early form of amplification, the latter playing forcefully on an acoustic guitar. Over the years, jazz guitarists have been able to solo in standard jazz idioms, such as bebop, cool jazz and so on, while in also absorbing influences from rock guitarists, such as the use of electronic effects.\n\nJazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. Wes Montgomery was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?). When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of Lenny Breau, Joe Pass, Martin Taylor and others. This technique can also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance Django Reinhardt's \"\"improvisations\"\", as he called his solo pieces.\n\nBULLET::::- List of jazz guitarists\nBULLET::::- Jazz guitarists\nBULLET::::- Swing (jazz performance style)\nBULLET::::- Jazz bass\n\nBULLET::::- The Guitar, in: Joachim-Ernst Berendt \"The Jazz Book\", Lawrence Hill & Company, New York\nBULLET::::- R., Ken (2012). \"DOG EAR Tritone Substitution for Jazz Guitar\", Amazon Digital Services, Inc., ASIN: B008FRWNIW\n\nBULLET::::- Jaén, Fernando Alonso (date unknown). “The Archtop Jazz Guitar”\nBULLET::::- Wilson, Gerald (2005).

{"id": "16142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16142", "title": "James Watt", "text": "James Watt\n\nJames Watt (; 30 January 1736 – 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen's 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world.\n\nWhile working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.\n\nWatt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775. The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work.\n\nHe developed the concept of horsepower, and the SI unit of power, the watt, was named after him.\n\nJames Watt was born on 19 January 1736 in Greenock, Renfrewshire, the eldest of the five surviving children of Agnes Muirhead (1703–1755) and James Watt (1698–1782). His mother came from a distinguished family, was well educated and said to be of forceful character, while his father was a shipwright, ship owner and contractor, and served as the Greenock's chief baillie in 1751. Watts parents were Presbyterians and strong Covenanters, however despite a religious upbringing he later became a deist. Watt's grandfather, Thomas Watt (1642–1734), was a teacher of mathematics, surveying and navigation and baillie to the Baron of Cartsburn.\n\nInitially Watt was educated at home by his mother, later going on to attend Greenock Grammar School. There he exhibited an aptitude for mathematics, while Latin and Greek failed to interest him.\n\nHe is said to have suffered prolonged bouts of ill-health as a child and from frequent headaches all his life.\n\nAfter leaving school Watt worked in the workshops of his father's businesses, demonstrating considerable dexterity and skill in creating engineering models. After his father suffered some unsuccessful business ventures Watt left Greenock to seek employment in Glasgow as a mathematical instrument maker.\n\nWhen he was 18 his mother died and his father's health began to fail. Watt travelled to London and was able to obtain a period of training as an instrument maker for a year (1755/56), then returned to Scotland, settling in the major commercial city of Glasgow intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. He was still very young and having not had a full apprenticeship did not have the usual connections via a former master to establish himself as a journeyman instrument maker.\n\nWatt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from Jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by Alexander Macfarlane to the University of Glasgow, instruments that required expert attention. Watt restored them to working order and was remunerated. These instruments were eventually installed in the Macfarlane Observatory. Subsequently, three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was initiated in 1757 and two of the professors, the physicist and chemist Joseph Black as well as the famed Adam Smith, became Watt's friends.\n\nAt first he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university, helping with demonstrations, and expanding the production of quadrants. He made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants, parallel rulers, scales, parts for telescopes, and barometers, among other things.\n\nIt is sometimes falsely stated that he struggled to establish himself in Glasgow due to opposition from the Trades House, but this myth has been thoroughly debunked by the historian, . The records from this period are lost but it is known that he was able to work and trade completely normally as a skilled metal worker so the Incorporation of Hammermen must have been satisfied that he met their requirements for membership. It is also known that other people in the metal trades were pursued for working without being members of the Incorporation well into the 19th century, so the rules were definitely being enforced when Watt was trading freely throughout the city.\n\nIn 1759 he formed a partnership with John Craig, an architect and businessman, to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys. This partnership lasted for the next six years, and employed up to sixteen workers. Craig died in 1765. One employee, Alex Gardner, eventually took over the business, which lasted into the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret (Peggy) Miller, with whom he had five children, two of whom lived to adulthood: James Jr. (1769–1848) and Margaret (1767–1796). His wife died in childbirth in 1772. In 1777 he was married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow dye-maker, with whom he had two children: Gregory (1777–1804), who became a geologist and mineralogist, and Janet (1779–1794). Ann died in 1832. Between 1777 and 1790 he lived in Regent Place, Birmingham.\n\nThere is a popular story that Watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling, the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing Watt the power of steam. This story is told in many forms; in some Watt is a young lad, in others he is older, sometimes it's his mother's kettle, sometimes his aunt's. James Watt of course did not actually \"invent\" the steam engine, as the story implies, but dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing Newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser. This is difficult to explain to someone not familiar with concepts of heat and thermal efficiency. It appears that the story of Watt and the kettle was created, possibly by Watt's son James Watt Jr., and persists because it is easy for children to understand and remember. In this light it can be seen as akin to the story of Isaac Newton, the falling apple and his discovery of gravity.\n\nAlthough it is often dismissed as a myth, like most good stories the story of James Watt and the kettle has a basis in fact. In trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam James Watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam.\n\nIn 1759 Watt's friend, John Robison, called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power. The design of the Newcomen engine, in use for almost 50 years for pumping water from mines, had hardly changed from its first implementation. Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine. He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject. He came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process—in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend Joseph Black had previously discovered some years before. Understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state, for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another 100 years.\n\nIn 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model Newcomen engine belonging to the university. Even after repair, the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle. This energy was wasted because later in the cycle cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure. Thus by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder, the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy.\n\nWatt's critical insight, arrived at in May 1765, was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston, and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a \"steam jacket.\" Thus very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle, making more available to perform useful work. Watt had a working model later that same year.\n\nDespite a potentially workable design, there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a full-scale engine. This required more capital, some of which came from Black. More substantial backing came from John Roebuck, the founder of the celebrated Carron Iron Works near Falkirk, with whom he now formed a partnership. Roebuck lived at Kinneil House in Bo'ness, during which time Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house. The shell of the cottage, and a very large part of one of his projects, still exist to the rear.\n\nThe principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder. Iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists, and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision. Much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on Watt's invention. Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor, then as a civil engineer—for eight years.\n\nRoebuck went bankrupt, and Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho Manufactory works near Birmingham, acquired his patent rights. An extension of the patent to 1800 was successfully obtained in 1775.\n\nThrough Boulton, Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world. The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by John Wilkinson, who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at Bersham, near Wrexham, North Wales. Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership, Boulton and Watt, which lasted for the next twenty-five years.\n\nIn 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises. These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft. The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in Cornwall for pumping water out of mines.\n\nThese early engines were not manufactured by Boulton and Watt, but were made by others according to drawings made by Watt, who served in the role of consulting engineer. The erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by Watt, at first, and then by men in the firm's employ. These were large machines. The first, for example, had a cylinder with a diameter of some 50 inches and an overall height of about 24 feet, and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it. Boulton and Watt charged an annual payment, equal to one third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a Newcomen engine performing the same work.\n\nThe field of application for the invention was greatly widened when Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding, weaving and milling. Although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, James Pickard, and associates proposed to cross-license the external condenser. Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in 1781.\n\nOver the next six years, he made a number of other improvements and modifications to the steam engine. A double acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on the two sides of the piston was one. He described methods for working the steam \"expansively\" (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from \"running away\" were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.\n\nBecause of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive stage of development, and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure.\n\nEdward Bull started constructing engines for Boulton and Watt in Cornwall in 1781. By 1792 he had started making engines of his own design, but which contained a separate condenser, and so infringed Watt's patents. Two brothers, Jabez Carter Hornblower and Jonathan Hornblower Jnr also started to build engines about the same time. Others began to modify Newcomen engines by adding a condenser, and the mine owners in Cornwall became convinced that Watt's patent could not be enforced. They started to withhold payments due to Boulton and Watt, which by 1795 had fallen. Of the total £21,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) owed, only £2,500 had been received. Watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims.\n\nHe first sued Bull in 1793. The jury found for Watt, but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial. In the meantime, injunctions were issued against the infringers, forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow. The trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive, but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers, except for Jonathan Hornblower, all began to settle their cases. Hornblower was soon brought to trial and the verdict of the four judges (in 1799) was decisively in favour of Watt. Their friend John Wilkinson, who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder, was a particularly grievous case. He had erected about twenty engines without Boulton's and Watts' knowledge. They finally agreed to settle the infringement in 1796. Boulton and Watt never collected all that was owed them, but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration. These trials were extremely costly in both money and time, but ultimately were successful for the firm.\n\nBefore 1780 there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings. The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using linked multiple pens. Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome. He instead decided to try to physically transfer some ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original. The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly.\n\nWatt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and James Keir (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794. It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century.\n\nFrom an early age Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise he tried to keep his method a secret.\n\nWith McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach 1500 yards of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt's rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success.\n\nBy 1794 Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatus to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases for several years, but by 1797 the medical uses for the \"factitious airs\" had come to a dead end.\n\nWatt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically. Humphry Davy said of him \"Those who consider James Watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character; he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of genius, the union of them for practical application\".\n\nHe was greatly respected by other prominent men of the Industrial Revolution. He was an important member of the Lunar Society, and was a much sought-after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons. His personal relationships with his friends and partners were always congenial and long-lasting.\n\nWatt was a prolific correspondent. During his years in Cornwall, he wrote long letters to Boulton several times per week. He was averse to publishing his results in, for example, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society however, and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents. He was an excellent draughtsman.\n\nHe was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine. In a letter to William Small in 1772, Watt confessed that \"he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain.\" Until he retired, he was always much concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His health was often poor and he suffered frequent nervous headaches and depression.\n\nAt first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines, and supervised the work to erect it on the customers property. They produced almost none of the parts themselves. Watt did most of his work at his home in Harper's Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the Soho Manufactory. Gradually the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts, and by 1795 they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho manufactory, on the banks of the Birmingham Canal, to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines. The Soho Foundry formally opened in 1796 at a time when Watt's sons, Gregory and James Jr. were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise. In 1800, the year of Watt's retirement, the firm made a total of 41 engines.\n\nWatt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men's sons, Matthew Robinson Boulton and James Watt Jr.. Longtime firm engineer William Murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered.\n\nWatt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. Within his home in Handsworth, Staffordshire, Watt made use of a garret room as a workshop, and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions. Among other things, he invented and constructed several machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well, but which he never patented. One of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend Adam Smith. He maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects. He proposed, for example, a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the Clyde at Glasgow.\n\nHe and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in mid-Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of Llanwrthwl, which he much improved.\n\nIn 1816 he took a trip on the paddle-steamer \"Comet\", a product of his inventions, to revisit his home town of Greenock.\n\nHe died on 25 August 1819 at his home \"Heathfield Hall\" near Handsworth in Staffordshire (now part of Birmingham) at the age of 83. He was buried on 2 September in the graveyard of St Mary's Church, Handsworth. The church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church.\n\nOn 16 July 1764 married his cousin Margaret Miller (\"d\". 1773), together they had two children, Margaret (1767–1796) and James (1769–1848). In 1791 their daughter married James Miller. their son did not marry. In September 1773 while Watt was working in the Scottish Highlands he learned that his wife Margaret, who was pregnant with their third child, was seriously ill. He immediately returned home but found that his wife had died and their child was stillborn.\n\nIn 1775 he married Ann MacGregor (d.1832).\n\nHe was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in The Glasgow Royal Arch Lodge, No.77, in 1763. The Lodge ceased to exist in 1810. A Masonic Lodge was named after him in his home town of Glasgow – Lodge James Watt, No.1215.\n\nWilliam Murdoch joined Boulton and Watt in 1777. At first he worked in the pattern shop in Soho, but soon he was erecting engines in Cornwall. He became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success. A very able man, he made several important inventions on his own.\n\nJohn Griffiths, who wrote a biography of him in 1992, has argued that Watt's discouraging Murdoch from working with high pressure steam (Watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe) on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development.\n\nWatt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in 1781 and a steam locomotive in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by Murdoch. The patent was never contested by Murdoch, however, and Boulton and Watt's firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines, even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794. Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76.\n\nAs one author states, James Watt's improvements to the steam engine \"converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution\". The reality, however, is that Watt's improvements upon the Newcomen engine had limited, albeit popular, utility given their size and low power, and were not carried over to the designs of the high-pressure steam engines to which these authors refer regarding the revolutionary impact of the steam engine, something Watt opposed.\n\nWatt was much honoured in his own time. In 1784 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was elected as a member of the Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy, of Rotterdam in 1787. In 1789 he was elected to the elite group, the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. In 1806 he was conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Glasgow. The French Academy elected him a Corresponding Member and he was made a Foreign Associate in 1814.\n\nThe watt is named after James Watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine, and was adopted by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889 and by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 as the unit of power incorporated in the International System of Units (or \"SI\").\n\nOn 29 May 2009 the Bank of England announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new £50 note. The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note, and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of Watt's steam engine and Boulton's Soho Manufactory. Quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note: \"I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER\" (Boulton) and \"I can think of nothing else but this machine\" (Watt). The inclusion of Watt is the second time that a Scot has featured on a Bank of England note (the first was Adam Smith on the 2007 issue £20 note). In September 2011 it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on 2 November.\n\nIn 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.\n\nWatt was buried in the grounds of St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried \"inside\" the church.\n\nThe garret room workshop that Watt used in his retirement was left, locked and untouched, until 1853, when it was first viewed by his biographer J. P. Muirhead. Thereafter, it was occasionally visited, but left untouched, as a kind of shrine. A proposal to have it transferred to the Patent Office came to nothing. When the house was due to be demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the Science Museum, where it was recreated in its entirety. It remained on display for visitors for many years, but was walled-off when the gallery it was housed in closed. The workshop remained intact, and preserved, and in March 2011 was put on public display as part of a new permanent Science Museum exhibition, \"James Watt and our world\".\n\nThe approximate location of James Watt's birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue. Several locations and street names in Greenock recall him, most notably the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt's donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the James Watt College). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of Inverclyde, and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule. Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in George Square, Glasgow and Princes Street, Edinburgh, as well as several others in Birmingham, where he is also remembered by the Moonstones and a school is named in his honour.\n\nThe James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in Kilwinning (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in Largs. Heriot-Watt University near Edinburgh was at one time the School of Arts of Edinburgh, founded in 1821 as the world's first Mechanics Institute, but to commemorate George Heriot, the 16th-century financier to King James, and James Watt, after Royal Charter the name was changed to Heriot-Watt University. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him. Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The University of Glasgow's Faculty of Engineering has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering.\nThe huge painting \"James Watt contemplating the steam engine\" by James Eckford Lauder is now owned by the National Gallery of Scotland.\n\nThere is a statue of James Watt in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester and City Square, Leeds.\n\nA colossal statue of Watt by Chantrey was placed in Westminster Abbey, and later was moved to St. Paul's Cathedral. On the cenotaph the inscription reads, in part, \"JAMES WATT ... ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN, AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD.\"\n\nA bust of Watt is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.\n\nWatt was the sole inventor listed on his six patents:\nBULLET::::- Patent 913: A method of lessening the consumption of steam in steam engines – the separate condenser.

{"id": "16143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16143", "title": "John Locke", "text": "John Locke\n\nJohn Locke (; 29 August 1632 – 28 October 1704) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the \"Father of Liberalism\". Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Sir Francis Bacon, he is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nLocke's theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and the self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers such as David Hume, Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of consciousness. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate or \"tabula rasa\". Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception. This is now known as empiricism. An example of Locke's belief in empiricism can be seen in his quote, \"whatever I write, as soon as I discover it not to be true, my hand shall be the forwardest to throw it into the fire.\" This shows the ideology of science in his observations in that something must be capable of being tested repeatedly and that nothing is exempt from being disproven. Challenging the work of others, Locke is said to have established the method of introspection, or observing the emotions and behaviours of one's self.\n\nLocke's father, also called John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in Chew Magna and as a captain of cavalry for the Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the English Civil War. His mother was Agnes Keene. Both parents were Puritans. Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched cottage by the church in Wrington, Somerset, about 12 miles from Bristol. He was baptised the same day. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the market town of Pensford, about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural Tudor house in Belluton.\n\nIn 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London under the sponsorship of Alexander Popham, a member of Parliament and his father's former commander. After completing studies there, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in the autumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. The dean of the college at the time was John Owen, vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as René Descartes, more interesting than the classical material taught at the university. Through his friend Richard Lower, whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the Royal Society, of which he eventually became a member.\n\nLocke was awarded a bachelor's degree in February 1656 and a master's degree in June 1658. He obtained a bachelor of medicine in February 1675, having studied medicine extensively during his time at Oxford and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as Robert Boyle, Thomas Willis, Robert Hooke and Richard Lower. In 1666, he met Anthony Ashley Cooper, Lord Ashley, who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. Ashley was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.\n\nLocke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Ashley's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as hIs personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of Thomas Sydenham. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinkingan effect that would become evident in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.\"\n\nLocke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Ashley's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Ashley to undergo surgery (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Ashley survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.\n\nDuring this time, Locke served as Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.\n\nAshley, as a founder of the Whig movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Ashley became Lord Chancellor in 1672 (Ashley being created 1st Earl of Shaftesbury in 1673). Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as a tutor and medical attendant to Caleb Banks. He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury's political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the \"Two Treatises of Government\". While it was once thought that Locke wrote the \"Treatises\" to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date. The work is now viewed as a more general argument against absolute monarchy (particularly as espoused by Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes) and for individual consent as the basis of political legitimacy. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about natural rights and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.\n\nLocke fled to the Netherlands in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the Rye House Plot, although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends \"from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as Spinoza's small group of loyal confidants. [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677.] Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone.\" While she says that \"Locke's strong empiricist tendencies\" would have \"disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's \"Ethics\", in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state.\"\n\nIn the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the \"Essay\" and composing the \"Letter on Toleration.\" Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution. Locke accompanied Mary II back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exilehis aforementioned \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\", the \"Two Treatises of Government\" and \"A Letter Concerning Toleration\" all appearing in quick succession.\n\nLocke's close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at Otes, the Mashams' country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton.\n\nHe died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver, east of Harlow in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children.\n\nEvents that happened during Locke's lifetime include the English Restoration, the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London. He did not quite see the Act of Union of 1707, though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime. Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Locke's time.\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's \"Two Treatises\" were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, \"except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')\". John Kenyon, in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were \"mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them\" and that \"no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke\". In contrast, Kenyon adds that Algernon Sidney's \"Discourses Concerning Government\" were \"certainly much more influential than Locke's \"Two Treatises\"\".\n\nIn the 50 years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the \"Two Treatises\" were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the \"Second Treatise\" gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston.\n\nLocke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. Michael Zuckert has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly separating the realms of Church and State. He had a strong influence on Voltaire who called him \"\"le sage\" Locke\". His arguments concerning liberty and the social contract later influenced the written works of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and other Founding Fathers of the United States. In fact, one passage from the \"Second Treatise\" is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a \"long train of abuses\". Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"Bacon, Locke and Newton... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".\n\nBut Locke's influence may have been even more profound in the realm of epistemology. Locke redefined subjectivity, or self, and intellectual historians such as Charles Taylor and Jerrold Seigel argue that Locke's \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1690) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self.\n\nLocke's theory of association heavily influenced the subject matter of modern psychology. At the time, the empiricist philosopher's recognition of two types of ideas, \"simple\" and \"complex\" ideas, more importantly their interaction through associationism inspired other philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley, to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world.\n\nLocke, writing his \"Letters Concerning Toleration\" (1689–1692) in the aftermath of the European wars of religion, formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance. Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) Even if they could, enforcing a single \"true religion\" would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.\n\nWith regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by Baptist theologians like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century. Baptist theologian Roger Williams founded the colony Rhode Island in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract \"The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience\" (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state. Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical and political agenda, since Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.\n\nAppraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the Royal African Company. In addition, he participated in drafting the \"Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina\" while Shaftesbury's secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves. For example, Martin Cohen notes that Locke, as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–1674) and a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), was in fact, \"one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude\". Some see his statements on unenclosed property as having been intended to justify the displacement of the Native Americans. Because of his opposition to aristocracy and slavery in his major writings, he is accused of hypocrisy and racism, or of caring only for the liberty of English capitalists. Locke also drafted implementing instructions for the Carolina colonists designed to ensure that settlement and development was consistent with the Fundamental Constitutions. Collectively, these documents are known as the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina.\n\nLocke uses the word \"property\" in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from labour. In Chapter V of his \"Second Treatise\", Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce those goods - “at least where there is enough [land], and as good, left in common for others” (paragraph 27) - or utilise property to produce goods beneficial to human society.\n\nLocke stated his belief, in his \"Second Treatise\", that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. This position can be seen as a labour theory of value. From this premise, Locke developed a labour theory of property, namely that ownership of property is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot \"dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily.\" Karl Marx later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his own social theory.\n\nLocke's political theory was founded on social contract theory. Unlike Thomas Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a natural state all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his \"life, health, liberty, or possessions\". Most scholars trace the phrase \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\" in the American Declaration of Independence, to Locke's theory of rights, though other origins have been suggested.\n\nLike Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a civil society to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day. Locke also advocated governmental separation of powers and believed that revolution is not only a right but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.\n\nAccording to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature, but, with the introduction of \"durable\" goods, men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for goods that would last longer and thus not offend the natural law. In his view, the introduction of money marks the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage. He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be \"hoarded up without injury to anyone,\" since they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, labour theory of value of the \"Two Treatises of Government\" stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in a letter he wrote titled \"Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\". Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end, upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.\n\nLocke's general theory of value and price is a supply and demand theory, which was set out in a letter to a Member of Parliament in 1691, titled \"Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\". He refers to supply as \"quantity\" and demand as \"rent\". \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers,\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.\" The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on \"money answers all things\" (Ecclesiastes) or \"rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough,\" and \"varies very little...\" Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the demand for money is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of capitalisation, such as land, which has value because \"by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income.\" He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange, he states that \"money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life,\" and for loanable funds, \"it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income... or interest.\"\n\nLocke distinguishes two functions of money, as a \"counter\" to measure value, and as a \"pledge\" to lay claim to goods. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.\n\nLocke argues that a country should seek a favourable balance of trade, lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country's money stock, if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.\n\nHe also prepares estimates of the cash requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers – middlemen – whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.\n\nLocke defines the self as \"that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends\". He does not, however, ignore \"substance\", writing that \"the body too goes to the making the man.\"\n\nIn his \"Essay\", Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the Augustinian view of man as originally sinful and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an \"empty\" mind, a \"tabula rasa\", which is shaped by experience; and reflections being the two sources of all our ideas.\n\nLocke's \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\" is an outline on how to educate this mind: he expresses the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an \"empty cabinet\", with the statement, \"I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.\"\n\nLocke also wrote that \"the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences.\" He argued that the \"associations of ideas\" that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the \"tabula rasa\". In his \"Essay\", in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting \"a foolish maid\" convince a child that \"goblins and sprites\" are associated with the night for \"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\"\n\nThis theory came to be called \"associationism\", and it strongly influenced 18th-century thought, particularly educational theory, as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of psychology and other new disciplines with David Hartley's attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his \"Observations on Man\" (1749).\n\nLocke was critical of Descartes' version of the dream argument, with Locke making the counterargument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life.\n\nSome scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs. Locke's religious trajectory began in Calvinist trinitarianism, but by the time of the \"Reflections\" (1695) Locke was advocating not just Socinian views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology. However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published \"Paraphrase\" (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like Biddle, and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an Arian position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence.\nLocke was at times not sure about the subject of original sin, so he was accused of Socinianism, Arianism, or Deism. But he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty. With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures. The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (\"The reasonableness of Christianity\", 1695). Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate atheism, because he thought the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos. That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises. In Locke's opinion the cosmological argument was valid and proved God's existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views. Additionally, Locke advocated a sense of piety out of gratitude to God for giving reason to men.\n\nLocke's concept of man started with the belief in creation. Like philosophers Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, Locke equated natural law with the biblical revelation. Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from Genesis 1 and 2 (creation), the Decalogue, the Golden Rule, the teachings of Jesus, and the letters of Paul the Apostle. The Decalogue puts a person's life, their reputation, and property under God's protection.\n\nLocke's philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke also derived basic human equality from the Bible, including the equality of the sexes, the starting point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed. Locke compared the English Monarchy's rule over the British people to Adam's rule over Eve in Genesis, which was appointed by God.\n\nFollowing Locke's philosophy, the American Declaration of Independence founded human rights partially on the biblical belief in creation. Locke's doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBULLET::::- (1690) \"A Second Letter Concerning Toleration\"\nBULLET::::- (1692) \"A Third Letter for Toleration\"\nBULLET::::- (1689) \"Two Treatises of Government\" (published throughout the 18th century by London bookseller Andrew Millar by commission for Thomas Hollis)\nBULLET::::- (1690) \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\"\nBULLET::::- (1691) \"Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money\"\nBULLET::::- (1693) \"Some Thoughts Concerning Education\"\nBULLET::::- (1695) \"The Reasonableness of Christianity, as Delivered in the Scriptures\"\nBULLET::::- (1695) \"A Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity\"\n\nBULLET::::- (1660) \"First Tract of Government\" (or \"the English Tract\")\nBULLET::::- (\"c.\"1662) \"Second Tract of Government\" (or \"the Latin Tract\")\nBULLET::::- (1664) \"Questions Concerning the Law of Nature\" (definitive Latin text, with facing accurate English trans. in Robert Horwitz et al., eds., John Locke, \"Questions Concerning the Law of Nature\", Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990).\nBULLET::::- (1667) \"Essay Concerning Toleration\"\nBULLET::::- (1706) \"Of the Conduct of the Understanding\"\nBULLET::::- (1707) \"A paraphrase and notes on the Epistles of St. Paul to the Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians\"\n\nBULLET::::- List of liberal theorists\n\nBULLET::::- to\n\nBULLET::::- Ashcraft, Richard, 1986. \"Revolutionary Politics & Locke's Two Treatises of Government.\" Princeton: Princeton University Press.

{"id": "16147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16147", "title": "Jewish holidays", "text": "Jewish holidays\n\nJewish holidays, also known as Jewish festivals or Yamim Tovim (, or singular , in transliterated Hebrew []), are holidays observed in Judaism and by Jews throughout the Hebrew calendar. They include religious, cultural and national elements, derived from three sources: biblical \"mitzvot\" (\"commandments\"); rabbinic mandates; Jewish history and the history of the State of Israel.\n\nJewish holidays occur on the same dates every year in the Hebrew calendar, but the dates vary in the Gregorian. This is because the Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar (based on the cycles of both the sun and moon), whereas the Gregorian is a solar calendar.\n\nCertain terms are used very commonly for groups of holidays.\nBULLET::::- The Hebrew-language term \"Yom Tov\" (יום טוב), sometimes referred to as \"festival day,\" usually refers to the six biblically-mandated festival dates on which all activities prohibited on Shabbat are prohibited, except for some related to food preparation. These include the first and seventh days of Passover, [first day of] Shavuot, both days of Rosh Hashanah, first day of Sukkot, and [first day of] Shemini Atzeret. By extension, outside the Land of Israel, the second-day holidays known under the rubric \"Yom tov sheni shel galuyot\" (literally, \"Second \"Yom Tov\" of the Diaspora\")—including Simchat Torah—are also included in this grouping. Colloquially, Yom Kippur, a biblically-mandated date on which even food preparation is prohibited, is often included in this grouping. The tradition of keeping two days of Yom Tov in the diaspora has existed since roughly 300 BCE.\nBULLET::::- The English-language term High Holy Days (or High Holidays) refers to Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur collectively. Its Hebrew analogue, \"Yamim Nora'im\" (ימים נוראים), \"Days of Awe”, is more flexible: it can refer just to those holidays, or to the Ten Days of Repentance, or to the entire penitential period, starting as early as the beginning of Elul, and (more rarely) ending as late as Shemini Atzeret.\nBULLET::::- The term Three Pilgrimage Festivals (שלוש רגלים, \"shalosh regalim\") refers to Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. Within this grouping Sukkot normally includes Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah.\n\nCertain terminology is used in referring to different categories of holidays, depending on their source and their nature:\n\n\"Shabbat\" (שבת) (Ashkenazi pron. from Yiddish \"shabbos\"), or Sabbath, is referred to by that name exclusively. Similarly, \"Rosh Chodesh\" (ראש חודש) is referred to by that name exclusively.\nBULLET::::- \"Yom tov\" (יום טוב) (Ashkenazi pron. from Yid. \"yontif\") (\"lit.,\" \"good day\"): See \"Groupings\" above.\nBULLET::::- \"Moed\" (מועד) (\"festive season\"), plural \"moadim\" (מועדים), refers to any of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot. When used in comparison to \"Yom Tov,\" it refers to Chol HaMoed, the intermediate days of Passover and Sukkot.\nBULLET::::- \"Ḥag\" or \"chag\" (חג) (\"festival\"), plural \"chagim\" (חגים), can be used whenever \"yom tov\" or \"moed\" is. It is also used to describe Hanukkah and Purim, as well as \"Yom Ha'atzmaut\" (Israeli Independence Day) and \"Yom Yerushalayim\" (Jerusalem Day).\nBULLET::::- \"Ta'anit\" (תענית), or, less commonly, \"tzom\" (צום), refers to a \"fast\". These terms are generally used to describe the rabbinic fasts, although \"tzom\" is used liturgically to refer to Yom Kippur as well.\n\nThe most notable common feature of Shabbat and the biblical festivals is the requirement to refrain from \"melacha\" on these days. \"Melacha\" is most commonly translated as \"work\"; perhaps a better translation is \"creative-constructive work\". Strictly speaking, \"Melacha\" is defined in Jewish law \"(halacha)\" by 39 categories of labor that were used in constructing the Tabernacle while the Jews wandered in the desert. As understood traditionally and in Orthodox Judaism:\nBULLET::::- On Shabbat and Yom Kippur all \"melacha\" is prohibited.\nBULLET::::- On a Yom Tov (other than Yom Kippur) which falls on a weekday, not Shabbat, most \"melacha\" is prohibited. Some \"melacha\" related to preparation of food is permitted.\nBULLET::::- On weekdays during Chol HaMoed, \"melacha\" is not prohibited \"per se.\" However, \"melacha\" should be limited to that required either to enhance the enjoyment of the remainder of the festival or to avoid great financial loss.\nBULLET::::- On other days, there are no restrictions on \"melacha.\"\nIn principle, Conservative Judaism understands the requirement to refrain from \"melacha\" in the same way as Orthodox Judaism. In practice, Conservative rabbis frequently rule on prohibitions around \"melacha\" differently from Orthodox authorities. Still, there are a number of Conservative/Masorti communities around the world where Sabbath and Festival observance fairly closely resembles Orthodox observance.\n\nHowever, many, if not most, lay members of Conservative congregations in North America do not consider themselves Sabbath-observant, even by Conservative standards. At the same time, adherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism do not accept \"halacha\", and therefore restrictions on \"melacha,\" as binding at all. Jews fitting any of these descriptions refrain from \"melacha\" in practice only as they personally see fit.\n\nShabbat and holiday work restrictions are always put aside in cases of \"pikuach nefesh,\" which is saving a human life. At the most fundamental level, if there is any possibility whatsoever that action must be taken to save a life, Shabbat restrictions are set aside immediately, and without reservation. Where the danger to life is present but less immediate, there is some preference to minimize violation of Shabbat work restrictions where possible. The laws in this area are complex.\n\nThe Torah specifies a single date on the Jewish calendar for observance of holidays. Nevertheless, festivals of biblical origin other than Shabbat and Yom Kippur are observed for two days outside the land of Israel, and Rosh Hashanah is observed for two days even inside the land of Israel.\n\nDates for holidays on the Jewish calendar are expressed in the Torah as \"day x of month y.\" Accordingly, the beginning of \"month y\" needs to be determined before the proper date of the holiday on \"day x\" can be fixed. Months in the Jewish calendar are lunar, and originally were proclaimed by the blowing of a \"shofar\". Later, the Sanhedrin received testimony of witnesses saying they saw the new crescent moon. Then the Sanhedrin would inform Jewish communities away from its meeting place that it had proclaimed a new moon. The practice of observing a second festival day stemmed from delays in disseminating that information.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Rosh Hashanah.\" Because of holiday restrictions on travel, messengers could not even leave the seat of the Sanhedrin until the holiday was over. Inherently, there was no possible way for anyone living away from the seat of the Sanhedrin to receive news of the proclamation of the new month until messengers arrived \"after the fact\". Accordingly, the practice emerged that Rosh Hashanah was observed on both possible days, as calculated from the previous month's start, everywhere in the world.\nBULLET::::- \"Three Pilgrimage Festivals.\" Sukkot and Passover fall on the 15th day of their respective months. This gave messengers two weeks to inform communities about the proclamation of the new month. Normally, they would reach most communities within the land of Israel within that time, but they might fail to reach communities farther away (such as those in Babylonia or overseas). Consequently, the practice developed that these holidays be observed for one day within Israel, but for two days (both possible days as calculated from the previous month's start) outside Israel. This practice is known as \"yom tov sheni shel galuyot\", \"second day of festivals in exile communities\".\n\nYom Kippur is not observed for two days anywhere because of the difficulty of maintaining a fast over two days.\n\nAdherents of Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism generally do not observe the second day of festivals, although some do observe two days of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nJewish law \"(halacha)\" accords \"Shabbat\" (שבת) the status of a holiday, a day of rest celebrated on the seventh day of each week. Jewish law defines a day as ending at either sundown or nightfall, when the next day then begins. Thus,\nBULLET::::- Shabbat begins just before sundown Friday night. Its start is marked by the lighting of Shabbat candles and the recitation of Kiddush over a cup of wine; and\nBULLET::::- Shabbat ends at nightfall Saturday night. Its conclusion is marked by the prayer known as Havdalah.\nThe fundamental rituals and observances of Shabbat include:\nBULLET::::- Reading of the Weekly Torah portion\nBULLET::::- Abbreviation of the Amidah in the three regular daily services to eliminate requests for everyday needs\nBULLET::::- Addition of a musaf service to the daily prayer services\nBULLET::::- Enjoyment of three meals, often elaborate or ritualized, through the course of the day\nBULLET::::- Restraint from performing \"melacha\" (see above).\nIn many ways, \"halakha\" (Jewish law) sees \"Shabbat\" as the most important holy day in the Jewish calendar.\nBULLET::::- It is the first holiday mentioned in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), and God was the first one to observe it (Genesis).\nBULLET::::- The Torah reading on \"Shabbat\" has more sections of \"parshiot\" (Torah readings) than on Yom Kippur or any other Jewish holiday.\nBULLET::::- The prescribed penalty in the Torah for a transgression of \"Shabbat\" prohibitions is death by stoning (Exodus 31), while for other holidays the penalty is (relatively) less severe.\nBULLET::::- Observance of Shabbat is the benchmark used in \"halacha\" to determine whether an individual is a religiously observant, religiously reliable member of the community.\n\nRosh Chodesh (ראש חודש) (lit., \"head of the month\") is a minor holiday or observance occurring on the first day of each month of the Jewish calendar, as well as the last day of the preceding month if it has thirty days.\nBULLET::::- Rosh Chodesh observance during at least a portion of the period of the prophets could be fairly elaborate.\nBULLET::::- Over time there have been varying levels of observance of a custom that women are excused from certain types of work.\nBULLET::::- Fasting is normally prohibited on Rosh Chodesh.\nBeyond the preceding, current observance is limited to changes in liturgy.\n\"Related observances:\"\nBULLET::::- The date of the forthcoming Rosh Chodesh is announced in synagogue on the preceding Sabbath.\nBULLET::::- There are special prayers said upon observing the waxing moon for the first time each month.\n\nThe month of Elul that precedes Rosh Hashanah is considered to be a propitious time for repentance. For this reason, additional penitential prayers called Selichot are added to the daily prayers, except on Shabbat. Sephardi Jews add these prayers each weekday during Elul. Ashkenazi Jews recite them from the last Sunday (or Saturday night) preceding Rosh Hashanah that allows at least four days of recitations.\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Rosh Hashanah (eve of the first day): 29 Elul\nBULLET::::- Rosh Hashanah: 1–2 Tishrei\n\nAccording to oral tradition, Rosh Hashanah (ראש השנה) (lit., \"Head of the Year\") is the Day of Memorial or Remembrance (יום הזכרון, \"Yom HaZikaron\"), and the day of judgment (יום הדין, \"Yom HaDin\"). God appears in the role of King, remembering and judging each person individually according to his/her deeds, and making a decree for each person for the following year.\n\nThe holiday is characterized by one specific mitzvah: blowing the \"shofar\". According to the Torah, this is the first day of the seventh month of the calendar year, and marks the beginning of a ten-day period leading up to Yom Kippur. According to one of two Talmudic opinions, the creation of the world was completed on Rosh Hashanah.\n\nMorning prayer services are lengthy on Rosh Hashanah, and focus on the themes described above: majesty and judgment, remembrance, the birth of the world, and the blowing of the \"shofar\". Ashkenazi Jews recite the brief \"Tashlikh\" prayer, a symbolic casting off of the previous year's sins, during the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah.\n\nThe Bible specifies Rosh Hashanah as a one-day holiday, but it is traditionally celebrated for two days, even within the Land of Israel. (See \"Second day of biblical festivals,\" above.)\n\nThe Torah itself does not use any term like \"new year\" in reference to Rosh Hashanah. The Mishnah in Rosh Hashanah specifies four different \"New Year's Days\" for different purposes:\nBULLET::::- 1 Tishrei (conventional \"Rosh Hashanah\"): \"new year\" for calculating calendar years, sabbatical-year \"(shmita)\" and jubilee cycles, and the age of trees for purposes of Jewish law; and for separating grain tithes.\nBULLET::::- 15 Shevat (Tu Bishvat): \"new year\" for trees–\"i.e.,\" their current agricultural cycle and related tithes.\nBULLET::::- 1 Nisan: \"new year\" for counting months and major festivals and for calculating the years of the reign of a Jewish king\nBULLET::::- In biblical times, the day following 29 Adar, Year 1 of the reign of ___, would be followed by 1 Nisan, Year 2 of the reign of ___.\nBULLET::::- In modern times, although the Jewish calendar year number changes on Rosh Hashanah, the months are still numbered from Nisan.\nBULLET::::- The three pilgrimage festivals are always reckoned as coming in the order Passover-Shavuot-Sukkot. This can have religious law consequences even in modern times.\nBULLET::::- 1 Elul (Rosh Hashanah LaBehema): \"new year\" for animal tithes.\n\nThe first ten days of Tishrei (from the beginning of Rosh Hashana until the end of Yom Kippur) are known as the Ten Days of Repentance (עשרת ימי תשובה, \"Aseret Yemei Teshuva\"). During this time, in anticipation of Yom Kippur, it is \"exceedingly appropriate\" for Jews to practice \"teshuvah\" (literally \"return\"), an examination of one's deeds and repentance for sins one has committed against other people and God. This repentance can take the form of additional supplications, confessing one's deeds before God, fasting, self-reflection, and an increase of involvement with, or donations to, charity.\n\nBULLET::::- Tzom Gedalia: 3 Tishrei\nThe Fast of Gedalia (צום גדליה) is a minor Jewish fast day. It commemorates the assassination of the governor of Judah, Gedalia, which ended any level of Jewish rule following the destruction of the First Temple.\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Yom Kippur: 9 Tishrei\nBULLET::::- Yom Kippur: 10 Tishrei (begins at sunset)\n\nYom Kippur (יום כיפור) is the holiest day of the year for Jews. Its central theme is atonement and reconciliation. This is accomplished through prayer and complete fasting—including abstinence from all food and drink (including water)—by all healthy adults. Bathing, wearing of perfume or cologne, wearing of leather shoes, and sexual relations are some of the other prohibitions on Yom Kippur—all them designed to ensure one's attention is completely and absolutely focused on the quest for atonement with God. Yom Kippur is also unique among holidays as having work-related restrictions identical to those of Shabbat. The fast and other prohibitions commence on 10 Tishrei at sunset—sunset being the \"beginning\" of the day in Jewish tradition.\n\nA traditional prayer in Aramaic called \"Kol Nidre\" (\"All Vows\") is traditionally recited just before sunset. Although often regarded as the start of the Yom Kippur evening service—to such a degree that \"Erev Yom Kippur\" (\"Yom Kippur Evening\") is often called \"Kol Nidre\" (also spelled \"Kol Nidrei\")—it is technically a separate tradition. This is especially so because, being recited before sunset, it is actually recited on 9 Tishrei, which is the day \"before\" Yom Kippur; it is not recited on Yom Kippur itself (on 10 Tishrei, which begins \"after\" the sun sets).\n\nA \"Tallit\" (four-cornered prayer shawl) is donned for evening and afternoon prayers–the only day of the year in which this is done. In traditional Ashkenazi communities, men wear the \"kittel\" throughout the day's prayers. The prayers on Yom Kippur evening are lengthier than on any other night of the year. Once services reconvene in the morning, the services (in all traditions) are the longest of the year. In some traditional synagogues prayers run continuously from morning until nightfall, or nearly so. Two highlights of the morning prayers in traditional synagogues are the recitation of \"Yizkor,\" the prayer of remembrance, and of liturgical poems \"(piyyutim)\" describing the temple service of Yom Kippur.\n\nTwo other highlights happen late in the day. During the \"Minchah\" prayer, the \"haftarah\" reading features the entire Book of Jonah. Finally, the day concludes with \"Ne'ilah,\" a special service recited only on the day of Yom Kippur. Ne'ilah deals with the closing of the holiday, and contains a fervent final plea to God for forgiveness just before the conclusion of the fast. Yom Kippur comes to an end with the blowing of the \"shofar\", which marks the conclusion of the fast. It is always observed as a one-day holiday, both inside and outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel.\n\nYom Kippur is considered, along with 15th of Av, as the happiest days of the year (Talmud Bavli—Tractate Ta'anit).\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Sukkot: 14 Tishrei\nBULLET::::- Sukkot: 15–21 Tishrei (22 outside Israel)\nBULLET::::- The first day of Sukkot is (outside Israel, first two days are) full\" yom tov, \"while the remainder of Sukkot has the status of Chol Hamoed, \"intermediate days\".\n\"Sukkot\" (סוכות or סֻכּוֹת, \"sukkōt\") or \"Succoth\" is a seven-day festival, also known as the Feast of Booths, the Feast of Tabernacles, or just Tabernacles. It is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (\"shalosh regalim\") mentioned in the Bible. Sukkot commemorates the years that the Jews spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land, and celebrates the way in which God protected them under difficult desert conditions. The word \"sukkot\" is the plural of the Hebrew word \"sukkah\", meaning booth. Jews are commanded to \"dwell\" in booths during the holiday. This generally means taking meals, but some sleep in the \"sukkah\" as well, particularly in Israel. There are specific rules for constructing a \"sukkah\".\n\nBULLET::::- Shemini Atzeret: 22 Tishrei (combined with Simchat Torah in Israel)\nBULLET::::- Simchat Torah outside Israel: 23 Tishrei\n\nThe holiday of Shemini Atzeret (שמיני עצרת) immediately follows the conclusion of the holiday of Sukkot. The Hebrew word \"shemini\" means \"eighth”, and refers to its position on \"the eighth day\" of Sukkot, actually a seven-day holiday. This name reflects the fact that while in many respects Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday in its own right, in certain respects its celebration is linked to that of Sukkot. Outside Israel, meals are still taken in the Sukkah on this day.\n\nThe main notable custom of this holiday is the celebration of \"Simchat Torah\" (שמחת תורה), meaning \"rejoicing with the Torah\". This name originally referred to a special \"ceremony\": the last weekly Torah portion is read from Deuteronomy, completing the annual cycle, and is followed immediately by the reading of the first chapter of Genesis, beginning the new annual cycle. Services are especially joyous, and all attendees, young and old, are involved.\n\nThis ceremony so dominates the holiday that in Israel, where the holiday is one day long, the whole holiday is often referred to as \"Simchat Torah\". Outside Israel, the holiday is two days long; the name \"Shemini Atzeret\" is used for the first day, while the second is normally called \"Simchat Torah\".\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Hanukkah: 24 Kislev\nBULLET::::- Hanukkah: 25 Kislev–2 or 3 Tevet\n\nThe story of Hanukkah (חנוכה) is preserved in the books of the First and Second Maccabees. These books are not part of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), they are apocryphal books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of olive oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the Talmud (Shabbat 21b), written about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.\n\nHanukkah marks the defeat of Seleucid Empire forces that had tried to prevent the people of Israel from practicing Judaism. Judah Maccabee and his brothers destroyed overwhelming forces, and rededicated the Temple in Jerusalem. The eight-day festival is marked by the kindling of lights—one on the first night, two on the second, and so on—using a special candle holder called a \"Hanukkiah\", or a \"Hanukkah menorah.\"\n\nReligiously, Hanukkah is a minor holiday. Except on Shabbat, restrictions on work do not apply. Aside from the kindling of lights, formal religious observance is restricted to changes in liturgy. Hanukkah celebration tends to be informal and based on custom rather than law. Three widely practiced customs include:\nBULLET::::- Consumption of foods prepared in oil, such as potato pancakes or \"sufganiyot,\" commemorating the miracle of oil\nBULLET::::- Playing the game of dreidel (called a \"sevivon\" in Hebrew), symbolizing Jews' disguising of illegal Torah study sessions as gambling meetings during the period leading to the Maccabees' revolt\nBULLET::::- Giving children money, especially coins, called Hanukkah gelt. However, the custom of giving presents is of far more recent, North American, origin, and is connected to the gift economy prevalent around North American Christmas celebrations.\n\nBULLET::::- Asarah B'Tevet: 10 Tevet\nThe Tenth of Tevet (עשרה בטבת, \"Asarah B'Tevet\") is a minor fast day, marking the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem as outlined in 2 Kings 25:1\n\nBULLET::::- Tu Bishvat: 15 Shevat\n\nTu Bishvat (ט\"ו בשבט) (lit., \"fifteenth of Shevat”, as ט״ו is the number \"15\" in Hebrew letters), is the new year for trees. It is also known as חג האילנות (\"Ḥag ha-Ilanot,\" Festival of Trees), or ראש השנה לאילנות (\"Rosh ha-Shanah la-Ilanot,\" New Year for Trees). According to the Mishnah, it marks the day from which fruit tithes are counted each year. Starting on this date, the biblical prohibition on eating the first three years of fruit (\"orlah\") and the requirement to bring the fourth year fruit \"(neta revai)\" to the Temple in Jerusalem were counted.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria of Safed and his disciples created a short seder, called \"Hemdat ha‑Yamim,\" reminiscent of the seder that Jews observe on Passover, that explores the holiday's Kabbalistic themes. This Tu Bishvat seder has witnessed a revival in recent years. More generally, Tu Bishvat is celebrated in modern times by eating various fruits and nuts associated with the Land of Israel.\n\nTraditionally, trees are planted on this day. Many children collect funds leading up to this day to plant trees in Israel. Trees are usually planted locally as well.\n\nBULLET::::- Fast of Esther: normally 13 Adar\nBULLET::::- Purim: 14 Adar\nBULLET::::- Shushan Purim: 15 Adar\nBULLET::::- In leap years on the Hebrew calendar, the above dates are observed in the Second Adar \"(Adar Sheni). The 14th and 15th of First Adar \"(Adar Rishon)\" are known as \"Purim Katan\"\n\n\"Purim Katan\" (פורים קטן) (lit., \"small Purim\") is observed on the 14th and 15th of First Adar in leap years. These days are marked by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.\n\n\"Ta'anit Esther\" (תענית אסתר), or \"Fast of Esther\", is named in honor of the fast of Esther and her court as Esther prepared to approach the king unbidden to invite him and Haman to a banquet. It commemorates that fast, as well as one alluded to later in the Book of Esther, undertaken as the Jews prepared to battle their enemies.\n\nThis fast is observed like other minor fasts (see Tzom Gedalia, above). While normally observed on 13 Adar, the eve of Purim, this fast is advanced to Thursday, 11 Adar, when 13 Adar falls on Shabbat.\n\nPurim (פורים) commemorates the events that took place in the Book of Esther. The principal celebrations or commemorations include:\nBULLET::::- The reading of the \"\"Megillah\"\". Traditionally, this is read from a scroll twice during Purim–once in the evening and again in the morning. Ashkenazim have a custom of making disparaging noises at every mention of Haman's name during the reading.\nBULLET::::- The giving of \"Mishloakh Manot\", gifts of food and drink to friends and neighbors.\nBULLET::::- The giving of \"Matanot La'evyonim\", gifts to the poor and the needy.\nBULLET::::- The Purim meal (\"Se'udat Purim\" or \"Purim Se'udah\"). This meal is traditionally accompanied by consumption of alcohol, often heavy, although Jewish sages have warned about the need to adhere to all religious laws even in a drunken state.\nSeveral customs have evolved from these principal commemorations. One widespread custom to act out the story of Purim. The Purim spiel, or Purim play, has its origins in this, although the \"Purim spiel\" is not limited to that subject. Wearing of costumes and masks is also very common. These may be an outgrowth of Purim plays, but there are several theories as to the origin of the custom, most related in some way to the \"hidden\" nature of the miracles of Purim.\n\nPurim carnivals of various types have also become customary. In Israel there are festive parades, known as \"Ad-D'lo-Yada\", in the town's main street. The largest and most renowned is in Holon.\n\nMost Jews celebrate Purim on 14 Adar, the day of celebration after the Jews defeated their enemies. Because Jews in the capital city of Shushan fought with their enemies an extra day, Purim is celebrated a day later there, on the day known as שושן פורים, Shushan Purim. This observance was expanded to \"walled cities\", which are defined as cities \"walled since the time of Joshua\". In practice, there are no Jews living in Shushan (Shush, Iran), and Shushan Purim is observed fully only in Jerusalem. Cities like Safed and Tiberias also partially observe Shushan Purim. Elsewhere, Shushan Purim is marked only by a small increase in festivity, including a prohibition on fasting, and slight changes in the liturgy.\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Pesach and Fast of the Firstborn, (\"Ta'anit Bechorot\"): 14 Nisan\nBULLET::::- Pesach (Passover): 15–21 Nisan (outside Israel 15–22 Nisan)\nBULLET::::- The first day and last day of Passover (outside Israel, first two and last two days) are full \"yom tov\", while the remainder of Passover has the status of \"Chol Hamoed\", \"intermediate days\".\nBULLET::::- Pesach Sheni (second Passover): 14 Iyar\n\nAs a rule, the month of Nisan is considered to be one of extra joy. Traditionally, throughout the entire month, Tahanun is omitted from the prayer service, many public mourning practices (such as delivering a eulogy at a funeral) are eliminated, and voluntary fasting is prohibited. However, practices sometimes vary.\n\nThe day before Passover (\"Erev Pesach,\" lit., \"Passover eve\") is significant for three reasons:\nBULLET::::- It is the day that all of the involved preparations for Passover, especially elimination of leavened food, or \"chametz\", must be completed. In particular, a formal search for remaining \"chametz\" is done during the evening of Erev Pesach, and all remaining \"chametz\" is finally destroyed, disposed of or nullified during the morning of Erev Pesach.\nBULLET::::- It is the day observed as the Fast of the Firstborn (תענית בכורות). Jews who are firstborn fast, in remembrance of the tenth plague, when God killed the Egyptian firstborn, while sparing the Jewish firstborn. This fast is overridden by a \"seudat mitzvah\", a meal celebrating the fulfillment of a commandment; accordingly, it is almost universal for firstborn Jews to attend such a meal on this day so as to obviate their need to fast.\nBULLET::::- During the era of the Temple in Jerusalem, the \"Korban Pesach\", or sacrifice of the Paschal Lamb, was carried out the afternoon of 14 Nisan in anticipation of its consumption on Passover night.\n\nWhen Passover starts on Sunday, and the eve of Passover is therefore Shabbat, the above schedule is altered. See Eve of Passover on Shabbat for details.\n\nPassover (פּסח) \"(Pesach\"), also known liturgically as חג המצות \"(\"Ḥag haMatzot\"\", the \"Festival of Unleavened Bread\"), is one of the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (\"shalosh regalim\") mentioned in the Torah. Passover commemorates the Exodus, the liberation of the Israelite slaves from Egypt. No \"chametz\" (leavened food) is eaten, or even owned, during the week of Passover, in commemoration of the biblical narrative in which the Israelites left Egypt so quickly that their bread did not have enough time to rise. Observant Jews go to great lengths to remove all \"chametz\" from their homes and offices in the run-up to Passover.\n\nAlong with the avoidance of \"chametz\", the principal ritual unique to this holiday is the seder. The \"seder\", meaning \"order\", is an ordered ritual meal eaten on the first night of Passover, and outside Israel also on the second night. This meal is known for its distinctive ritual foods—matzo (unleavened bread), maror (bitter herbs), and four cups of wine—as well as its prayer text/handbook/study guide, the Haggadah. Participation in a Passover seder is one of the most widely observed Jewish rituals, even among less affiliated or less observant Jews.\n\nPassover lasts seven days in Israel, and eight days outside Israel. The holiday of the last day of Passover (outside Israel, last two days) commemorates the Splitting of the Red Sea; according to tradition this occurred on the seventh day of Passover.\n\n\"Pesach Sheni\" (פסח שני) (\"Second Passover\") is a day prescribed in the Torah to allow those who did not bring the Paschal Lamb offering \"(Korban Pesach)\" a second chance to do so. Eligibility was limited to those who were distant from Jerusalem on Passover, or those who were ritually impure and ineligible to participate in a sacrificial offering. Today, some have the custom to eat matzo on Pesach Sheni, and some make a small change to the liturgy.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Sefirat HaOmer\" (Counting of the Omer): 16 Nisan–5 Sivan\n\"Sefirah\" (lit. \"Counting\"; more fully, \"Sefirat HaOmer,\" \"Counting of the Omer\") (ספירת העומר), is the 49-day period between the biblical pilgrimage festivals of Passover and Shavuot. The Torah states that this period is to be counted, both in days and in weeks. The first day of this period is the day of the first grain offering of the new year's crop, an omer of barley. The day following the 49th day of the period is the festival of Shavuot; the Torah specifies a grain offering of wheat on that day.\n\nBULLET::::- Lag Ba'Omer: 18 Iyar\n\"Lag Ba'Omer\" () is the 33rd day in the Omer count ( is the number 33 in Hebrew). By Ashkenazi practice, the semi-mourning observed during the period of Sefirah (see above) is lifted \"on\" Lag Ba'Omer, while Sefardi practice is to lift it \"at the end of\" Lag Ba'Omer. Minor liturgical changes are made on Lag Ba'omer; because mourning practices are suspended, weddings are often conducted on this day.\n\nBULLET::::- Erev Shavuot: 5 Sivan\nBULLET::::- Shavuot: 6 (and outside Israel: 7) Sivan\n\n\"Shavuot\" (), the Feast of Weeks, is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (\"Shalosh regalim\") ordained in the Torah. Different from other biblical holidays, the date for Shavuot is not explicitly fixed in the Torah. Instead, it is observed on the day following the 49th and final day in the counting of the Omer. In the current era of the fixed Jewish calendar, this puts the date of Shavuot as 6 Sivan. In Israel and in Reform Judaism, it is a one-day holiday; elsewhere, it is a two-day holiday extending through 7 Sivan.\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, codified in the Talmud at Shabbat 87b, the Ten Commandments were given on this day. In the era of the Temple, there were certain specific offerings mandated for Shavuot, and Shavuot was the first day for bringing of Bikkurim to the Temple. Other than those, there are no explicit \"mitzvot\" unique to Shavuot given in the Torah (parallel to matzo on Passover or Sukkah on Sukkot).\n\nNevertheless, there are a number of widespread customs observed on Shavuot. During this holiday the Torah portion containing the Ten Commandments is read in the synagogue, and the biblical Book of Ruth is read as well. It is traditional to eat dairy meals during Shavuot. In observant circles, all night Torah study is common on the first night of Shavuot, while in Reform Judaism, Shavuot is the customary date for Confirmation ceremonies.\n\nThe three-week period starting on 17 Tammuz and concluding after Tisha B'Av has traditionally been observed as a period of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple there.\n\nBULLET::::- Shiva Asar B'Tammuz: 17 Tammuz\nThe Seventeenth of Tamuz (שבעה עשר בתמוז, \"Shiva Asar B'Tamuz\") traditionally marks the first breach in the walls of the Jerusalem during the Roman conquest in 70 CE, at the end of the Second Temple period. According to tradition, this day has had negative connotations since Moses broke the first set of tablets on this day. The Mishnah cites five negative events that happened on 17 Tammuz.\n\nBULLET::::- The Three Weeks: 17 Tammuz – 9 Av\nBULLET::::- The Nine Days: 1–9 Av\nBULLET::::- The Week of Tisha B'Av (beginning at the conclusion of Shabbat preceding Tisha B'Av)\n\nThe period between the fasts of 17 Tammuz and 9 Av, known as the \"Three Weeks\" (Hebrew: בין המצרים, \"between the straits\"), features a steadily increasing level of mourning practices as Tisha B'Av approaches. Ashkenazi Jews refrain from conducting weddings and other joyful events throughout the period unless the date is established by Jewish law (as for a bris or \"pidyon haben)\". They do not cut their hair during this period. Starting on the first of Av and throughout the nine days between the 1st and 9th days of Av, Ashkenazim traditionally refrain from eating meat and drinking wine, except on Shabbat or at a \"Seudat Mitzvah\" (a Mitzvah meal, such as for a bris or \"siyum\"). They also refrain from bathing for pleasure. Sefardic practice varies some from this; the less severe restrictions usually begin on 1 Av, while the more severe restrictions apply during the week of Tisha B'Av itself.\n\nSubject to the variations described above, Orthodox Judaism continues to maintain the traditional prohibitions. In Conservative Judaism, the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued several responsa (legal rulings) which hold that the prohibitions against weddings in this timeframe are deeply held traditions, but should not be construed as binding law. Thus, Conservative Jewish practice would allow weddings during this time, except on the 17th of Tammuz and 9th of Av themselves. Rabbis within Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism hold that halakha (Jewish law) is no longer binding and follow their individual consciences on such matters. Nevertheless, the rabbinical manual of the Reform movement encourages Reform rabbis not to conduct weddings on Tisha B'Av itself \"out of historical consciousness and respect\" for the Jewish community.\n\nBULLET::::- Tisha B'Av : 9 Av\n\"Tisha B'Av\" () is a major fast day and day of mourning. A Midrashic tradition states that the spies' negative report concerning the Land of Israel was delivered on Tisha B'Av. Consequently, the day became auspicious for negative events in Jewish history. Most notably, both the First Temple, originally built by King Solomon, and the Second Temple of Roman times were destroyed on Tisha B'Av. Other calamities throughout Jewish history are said to have taken place on Tisha B'Av, including King Edward I's edict compelling the Jews to leave England (1290) and the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492.\n\nBULLET::::- Tu B'Av: 15 Av\n\"Tu B'av\" (ט״ו באב), lit. \"15th of Av\", is a day mentioned in the Talmud alongside Yom Kippur as \"happiest of the year\". It was a day celebrating the bringing of wood used for the Temple Service, as well as a day when marriages were arranged. Today, it is marked by a small change in liturgy. In modern Israel, the day has become somewhat of an analog to Valentine's Day.\n\nSeveral other fast days of ancient or medieval origin continue to be observed to some degree in modern times. Such continued observance is usually by Orthodox Jews only, and is not universal today even among Orthodox Jews.\n\nBULLET::::- Fasts for droughts and other public troubles. Much of the Talmudic tractate \"Ta'anit\" is devoted to the proclamation and execution of public fasts. The most detailed description refers to fasts in times of drought in the Land of Israel. Apparently these fasts included a \"Ne'ilah\" (closing) prayer, a prayer now reserved for recitation on Yom Kippur only.\nBULLET::::- \"Behab\" (בה\"ב). The fasts of \"bet-hey-bet\"—Monday-Thursday-Monday—were established as a vehicle for atonement from possible excesses during the extended holiday periods of Passover and Sukkot. They are proclaimed on the first Shabbat of the month of Iyar following Passover, and Marcheshvan following Sukkot. Based on the model of Mishnah \"Ta'anit\", they are then observed on the Monday, Thursday and Monday following that Shabbat.\nBULLET::::- \"Yom Kippur Katan\" (\"little Yom Kippur\"). These fasts originated in the sixteenth-century Kabbalistic community of Safed. They are conceptually linked to the sin-offerings that were brought to the Temple in Jerusalem on each Rosh Chodesh. These fasts are observed on the day before Rosh Chodesh in most months.\n\nAs a general rule, the biblical Jewish holidays (Sabbath, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot and Purim) are observed as public holidays in Israel. Chanukah is a school holiday, but businesses remain open. On Tisha B'Av, restaurants and places of entertainment are closed. Other Jewish holidays listed above are observed in varying ways and to varying degrees.\n\nBetween the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 and the aftermath of the Six-Day War, the Knesset, generally in consultation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, established four national holidays or days of remembrance:\n\nBULLET::::- \"Yom HaShoah:\" Holocaust Remembrance Day\nBULLET::::- \"Yom Hazikaron:\" Memorial Day\nBULLET::::- \"Yom Ha'atzmaut:\" Israel Independence Day\nBULLET::::- \"Yom Yerushalayim:\" Jerusalem Day\n\nThe status of these days as \"religious\" events is not uniform within the Jewish world. Non-Orthodox, Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jewish religious movements accept these days as \"religious\" as well as \"national\" in nature.\n\nAs a rule, these four days are not accepted as religious observances by most Haredi Jews, including Hasidim. Some \"ḥaredim\" are opposed to the existence of the State of Israel altogether on religious grounds; others simply feel that there are not sufficient grounds under Jewish law to justify the establishment of new religious holidays. For details, see Haredim and Zionism.\n\nObservance of these days in Jewish communities outside Israel is typically more muted than their observance in Israel. Events held in government and public venues within Israel are often held in Jewish communal settings (synagogues and community centers) abroad.\n\nMore recently, the Knesset established two additional holidays:\n\nBULLET::::- \"Yom HaAliyah\": Aliyah Day\nBULLET::::- A day to commemorate the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands and Iran\n\nFinally, the Israeli government also recognizes several ethnic Jewish observances with holiday status.\n\nBULLET::::- Yom HaShoah: (nominally) 27 Nisan\n\n\"Yom HaShoah\" (lit. \"Holocaust Day\") is a day of remembrance for victims of the Holocaust. Its full name is \"Yom Hazikaron LaShoah v'LiGevurah\" (lit. \"Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day\") (), and reflects a desire to recognize martyrs who died in active resistance to the Nazis alongside those who died as passive victims. Its date, 27 Nisan, was chosen because it commemorates the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the best known of the armed Jewish uprisings.\n\nPlaces of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Public commemoration of Yom HaShoah usually includes religious elements such as the recitation of Psalms, memorial prayers, and kaddish, and the lighting of memorial candles. In Israel, the most notable observances are the State memorial ceremony at Yad Vashem and the sirens marking off a two-minute silence at 10:00 am. Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox Jews generally participate in such public observances along with secular Jews and Jews who adhere to more liberal religious movements. Outside Israel, Jewish communities observe Yom HaShoah in addition to or instead of their countries' Holocaust Memorial Days. Probably the most notable commemoration is the March of the Living, held at the site of Auschwitz-Birkenau, attended by Jews from all parts of the world.\n\nOutside Orthodoxy, a liturgy for Yom HaShoah is beginning to develop. The Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist prayer books all include liturgical elements for Yom HaShoah, to be added to the regular weekday prayers. Conservative Judaism has written a scroll, called \"Megillat HaShoah,\" intended to become a definitive liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah. The Orthodox world–even the segment that participates publicly in Yom HaShoah–has been reluctant to write a liturgy for the day, preferring to compose \"Kinnot\" (prayers of lamentation) for recitation on Tisha B'Av.\n\nIn order to ensure that public Yom HaShoah ceremonies in Israel do not violate Shabbat prohibitions, the date for Yom HaShoah varies as follows:\nBULLET::::- If 27 Nisan occurs on a Friday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is advanced to the previous day (Thursday, 26 Nisan).\nBULLET::::- If 27 Nisan occurs on a Sunday, the observance of Yom HaShoah is delayed to the following day (Monday, 28 Nisan).\n\nBULLET::::- Yom Hazikaron: (nominally) 4 Iyar\n\n\"Yom Hazikaron\" (lit. \"Memorial Day\") is a day of remembrance of the fallen of Israel's wars. During the first years of Israel's independence, this remembrance was observed on Yom Ha'atzmaut (Independence Day) itself. However, by 1951, the memorial observance was separated from the festive celebration of Independence Day and moved to its current date, the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut. Since 2000, the scope of the memorial has expanded to include civilians slain by acts of hostile terrorism. Its full name is now (\"Day of Remembrance for the Fallen of the Battles of Israel and the Victims of Terror\").\n\nPlaces of public entertainment are closed throughout Israel in recognition of the day. Many schools, businesses and other institutions conduct memorial services on this day, and it is customary to visit the graves of fallen soldiers and to recite memorial prayers there. The principal public observances are the evening opening ceremony at the Western Wall and the morning services of remembrance at military cemeteries throughout the country, each opened by the sounding of sirens. The public observances conclude with the service at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl that serves as the transition to Yom Ha'atzmaut.\n\nOutside Israel, Yom HaZikaron observances are often folded into Yom Ha'atzmaut celebrations. Within Israel, Yom Hazikaron is always the day before Yom Ha'atzmaut, but that date moves to prevent violation of Sabbath prohibitions during the ceremonies of either day. See following section for details.\n\nBULLET::::- Yom Ha'atzmaut: (nominally) 5 Iyar\n\n\"Yom Ha'atzmaut\" () is Israel's Independence Day. Observance of this day by Jews inside and outside Israel is widespread, and varies in tone from secular (military parades and barbecues) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies).\n\nAlthough Israel's independence was declared on a Friday, the Chief Rabbinate has long been mindful of the possibility of Yom Ha'atzmaut (and Yom Hazikaron) observances leading to violation of Sabbath prohibitions. To prevent such violations, the dates of Yom Hazikaron and Yom Ha'atzmaut vary as follows:\nBULLET::::- If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Sunday-Monday, the observances are delayed to Monday-Tuesday, 5–6 Iyar.\nBULLET::::- If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Tuesday-Wednesday, the observances are not moved.\nBULLET::::- If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Thursday-Friday, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 3–4 Iyar.\nBULLET::::- If 4–5 Iyar occur on a Friday-Shabbat, the observances are advanced to Wednesday-Thursday, 2–3 Iyar.\n\nNearly all non-\"ḥaredi\" Jewish religious communities have incorporated changes or enhancements to the liturgy in honor of Yom Ha'atzmaut and suspend the mourning practices of the period of Sefirat Ha'Omer. (See Yom Ha'atzmaut—Religious Customs for details.) Within the Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox communities, these changes are not without controversy, and customs continue to evolve.\n\n\"Ḥaredi\" religious observance of Yom Ha'atzmaut varies widely. A few \"ḥaredim\" (especially Sefardic Ḥaredim) celebrate the day in a reasonably similar way to the way non-\"ḥaredim\" do. Most \"ḥaredim\" simply treat the day indifferently; \"i.e.,\" as a regular day. And finally others (notably Satmar Ḥasidim and Neturei Karta) mourn on the day because of their opposition to the enterprise of the State of Israel.\n\nBULLET::::- Yom Yerushalayim: 28 Iyar\n\nJerusalem Day () marks the 1967 reunification of Jerusalem under Israeli control during the Six-Day War. This marked the first time in 19 years that the Temple Mount was accessible to Jews, and the first time since the destruction of the Second Temple 1900 years earlier that the Temple Mount was under Jewish political control.\n\nAs with Yom Ha'atzmaut, celebrations of Yom Yerushalayim range from completely secular (including hikes to Jerusalem and a large parade through downtown Jerusalem) to religious (recitation of Hallel and new liturgies). Although Haredim do not participate in the liturgical changes, they are somewhat more likely to celebrate Yom Yerushalayim than the other modern Israeli holidays because of the importance of the liberation of the Western Wall and the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nOutside Israel, observance of Yom Yerushalayim is widespread, especially in Orthodox circles. It has not gained as widespread acceptance as Yom Ha'atzmaut, especially among more politically liberal Jews, because of the continuing conflicts over the future of the city.\n\nYom Yerushalayim has not traditionally moved to avoid Shabbat desecration, although in 2012 the Chief Rabbinate began some efforts in that direction.\n\nBULLET::::- Yom HaAliyah: 10 Nisan\nAliyah Day () is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of Nisan. The day was established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim (immigrants) to Israeli society.\n\nBULLET::::- Day to Mark the Departure and Expulsion of Jews from the Arab Countries and Iran: 30 November (on the Gregorian calendar)\n\nThe Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of Mizrahi Jews during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of European Jewry during the Holocaust and in comparison to the Palestinian Nakba. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.\n\nAt the present time, observance of this day appears to be secular in nature.\n\nThe Israeli government officially recognizes three traditional holidays of ethnic Jewish communities in Israel. These days are also observed by their respective communities outside Israel.\nBULLET::::- \"Mimouna\" began as a holiday of Moroccan Jews, while similar celebrations also exist among Turkish Jews and Persian Jews. These festivals are observed on the day after Passover, when eating of ordinary food (\"chametz\") resumes. In Israel, observance of Mimouna has spread widely in recent years; it has been estimated that up to two million Jews in Israel now participate in Mimouna celebrations.\nBULLET::::- The \"Seharane\" was celebrated by Kurdish Jews as a multi-day nature festival starting the day after Passover. Communities would leave their villages and camp out for several days, celebrating with eating and drinking, nature walks, singing and dancing.\nBULLET::::- The \"Sigd\" began as an evolution of the observance of Yom Kippur by the Beta Israel (Ethiopian) community. Currently that community now observes it in addition to Yom Kippur; its date is 29 Heshvan, 49 days after Yom Kippur. It shares some features of Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other holidays.\n\nBULLET::::- Jewish greetings\nBULLET::::- Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000–2050\nBULLET::::- List of observances set by the Hebrew calendar\nBULLET::::- List of Gregorian Jewish-related and Israeli holidays\nBULLET::::- Religious festival\nBULLET::::- Torah readings of Yom Tov\nBULLET::::- Brofsky, David. \"Hilkhot Moadim: Understanding the Laws of the Festivals.\" Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2013.\nBULLET::::- Greenberg, Irving. \"The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays.\" New York: Touchstone, 1988.\nBULLET::::- Renberg, Dalia H. \"The Complete Family Guide to Jewish Holidays.\" New York: Adama, 1985.\nBULLET::::- Strassfeld, Michael. \"The Jewish Holidays: A Guide and Commentary.\" New York: Harper & Row, 1985.\n\nBULLET::::- Jewish Holidays Online—List of all Jewish holidays for the current year (or any given year)\nBULLET::::- Hebcal—Interactive Jewish calendar with candle lighting times and Torah readings.\nBULLET::::- Jewish Holidays\nBULLET::::- A calculator that figures out the dates of Jewish holidays in any year\nBULLET::::- Jewish Holidays: A Primer—Patheos\nBULLET::::- What are the main Jewish festivals?—BBC\nBULLET::::- 2016-2017 Jewish Calendar\n"}

He later worked for Business Roundtable, where \"The Hill\" called him one of the country's top lobbyists. \n\nEngler has spent most of his adult life in government. He was serving in the Michigan Senate when he enrolled at Thomas M. Cooley Law School and graduated with a Juris Doctor degree, having served as a Michigan State senator since 1979. He was elected Senate majority leader in 1984 and served there until being elected governor in 1990.\n\nEngler served on the board of advisors of the Russell Kirk Center for Cultural Renewal, an educational organization that continues the intellectual legacy of noted conservative and Michigan native Russell Kirk. Engler also served on the board of trustees of the Marguerite Eyer Wilbur Foundation, which funds many Kirk Center programs. Engler was a member of the Annie E. Casey Foundation board of trustees until 2014. As of 2018, he serves on the board of directors of Universal Forest Products. Previous board service included serving as a director of Dow Jones and Delta Air Lines and as a trustee of Munder Funds.\n\nEngler, a Roman Catholic, was born in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, on October 12, 1948, to Mathias John Engler and his wife, Agnes Marie (née Neyer), but grew up on a cattle farm near Beal City.\n\nHe attended Michigan State University, graduating with a degree in agricultural economics in 1971, and Thomas M. Cooley Law School, graduating with a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1981.\n\nHe was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives as a state representative in 1970 at the age of 22. He served in the House from 1971 to 1978. His campaign manager in that first election was a college friend, Dick Posthumus. Engler later became the first Republican youth vice-chair for the Michigan Republican Party, defeating future U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. Posthumus later went on to be elected a state senator, Senate Majority Leader and Lieutenant Governor. He was Engler's running mate in the 1998 election and served from 1999 to 2003.\n\nEngler's administration was characterized by privatization of state services, income tax reduction, a sales tax increase, educational reform, welfare reform, and major reorganization of executive branch departments.\n\nIn 1996, he was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and, in 2001, he was elected to head the National Governors Association.\n\nIn 2002, near the end of his final term, Engler and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality attempted to negotiate a consent order with Dow Chemical that would have resulted in a ninefold increase in the allowable levels of dioxins. The consent order would have resulted in Dow not having to pay to clean up high levels of toxins in Midland, Michigan, near its plant there, as well as in the Tittabawassee flood plain, which had been contaminated by dioxins dumped into the river from the facility and from overflow from waste ponds. The consent order fell through in late 2002.\n\nDuring the 1996 presidential election, Engler was considered by many political commentators and experts to be a serious potential vice presidential running mate for Republican nominee Bob Dole. However, Dole instead selected Jack Kemp, a former congressman and HUD secretary.\n\nEngler endorsed Texas Governor George W. Bush in the 2000 Republican primary. After Bush secured the GOP nomination, Engler's name began to surface as a possible running mate for Bush. In his book \"Decision Points\", Bush says that Engler was someone he was \"close\" with and could \"work well with.\" Ultimately, Engler was passed over for the running mate position in favor of Dick Cheney. After the election, Engler's close political ally Spencer Abraham, who narrowly lost his re-election bid for the Senate to Debbie Stabenow, was chosen as Bush's Secretary of Energy.\n\nEngler's lieutenant governor, Dick Posthumus, sought to succeed Engler in the 2002 gubernatorial race. Posthumus lost a close race to the state's attorney general, Democrat Jennifer Granholm.\n\nIn 1990, Engler, then the state senate majority leader, challenged Governor James Blanchard in his bid for a third term. Political observers viewed his bid as a long shot, and he trailed Blanchard by double digits in the polls the weekend before the election. However, on election day, Engler pulled off the upset, defeating Blanchard by approximately 17,000 votes—a margin of less than one percentage point. In 1994, Engler ran for his second term. The Democrats nominated former Representative Howard Wolpe, who had close ties to the labor movement—a potent force in Democratic politics in Michigan. Engler bested Wolpe 61 to 39 percent, and the state Republican Party made significant gains. Spencer Abraham picked up the Senate seat of retiring Democrat Donald Riegle. Republicans gained a seat to break a tie in the state House of Representatives, taking a 56–54 majority, while also picking up a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republican Candice Miller won an upset victory to win the post of Secretary of State.\n\nMichigan voters re-elected Engler to his third and final term in 1998. He won a landslide victory over lawyer Geoffrey Fieger. Engler took 1,883,005 votes—62 percent of the total—to Fieger's 38 percent and 1,143,574 votes. Engler's landslide helped the state Republican Party to gain six seats in the state House of Representatives, taking control of the chamber they had lost two years previously with a 58–52 margin, as well as picking up an additional seat in the State Senate, for a 23–15 majority. Republicans also gained a seat on the technically non-partisan state Supreme Court, holding a 4–3 majority over the Democrats.\n\nAfter leaving the governor's mansion in January 2003, Engler served as president of the state and local government sector of Electronic Data Systems. Engler left that position in June 2004 to be elected president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. Engler's six plus year tenure at the NAM ended in January 2011. In January 2011, Engler was named president of the Business Roundtable.\nIn 2017, Engler was appointed to a four-year term on the governing board of the National Assessment of Educational Progress project.\n\nOn January 30, 2018, Engler was named the interim president of Michigan State University to replace Lou Anna Simon, who with the school was embroiled in the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. The appointment of Engler sparked further controversy due to his previous handling of sexual misconduct as governor of Michigan. Engler's tenure as interim president was plagued by controversy, brought on by Engler's apparent callous statements and actions toward survivors during MSU Board of Trustees meetings and statements that were reported by the press. One of the leading Nassar survivors, Rachel Denhollander, said this of Engler, “He chose to stand against every child and every sexual assault victim in the entire state, to protect an institution.” Engler resigned on January 16, 2019 after the Board of Trustees indicated its intent to ask him to resign following a series of embarrassing incidents regarding Nassar's victims and his response to issues in the aftermath. Engler initially indicated he planned to resign on January 23, but the Board required him to resign the morning after he submitted his resignation letter. \n\nEngler married Colleen House Engler in 1975, who served in the Michigan House of Representatives and ran for lieutenant governor of Michigan in 1986. She filed for divorce in 1986.\n\nEngler married Michelle DeMunbrun, a Texas attorney, on December 8, 1990. The couple has triplet daughters born November 13, 1994. As First Lady, Michelle Engler served as the founding chair of the Michigan Community Service Commission. Michelle Engler was named to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) board in 2001 by President George W. Bush and re-appointed in 2002.\n"}
{"id": "16153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16153", "title": "Jacques Lacan", "text": "Jacques Lacan\n\nJacques Marie Émile Lacan (; ; 13 April 1901 – 9 September 1981) was a French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist who has been called \"the most controversial psycho-analyst since Freud\". Giving yearly seminars in Paris from 1953 to 1981, Lacan influenced many leading French intellectuals in the 1960s and the 1970s, especially those associated with post-structuralism. His ideas had a significant impact on post-structuralism, critical theory, linguistics, 20th-century French philosophy, film theory, and clinical psychoanalysis.\n\nLacan was born in Paris, the eldest of Émilie and Alfred Lacan's three children. His father was a successful soap and oils salesman. His mother was ardently Catholic – his younger brother entered a monastery in 1929. Lacan attended the Collège Stanislas between 1907 and 1918. An interest in philosophy led him to a preoccupation with the work of Spinoza, one outcome of which was his abandonment of religious faith for atheism. There were tensions in the family around this issue, and he regretted not persuading his brother to take a different path, but by 1924 his parents had moved to Boulogne and he was living in rooms in Montmartre.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, Lacan actively engaged with the Parisian literary and artistic avant-garde. Having met James Joyce, he was present at the Parisian bookshop where the first readings of passages from \"Ulysses\" in French and English took place, shortly before it was published in 1922. He also had meetings with Charles Maurras, whom he admired as a literary stylist, and he occasionally attended meetings of Action Française (of which Maurras was a leading ideologue), of which he would later be highly critical.\n\nIn 1920, after being rejected for military service on the grounds that he was too thin, Lacan entered medical school. Between 1927 and 1931, after completing his studies at the faculty of medicine of the University of Paris, he specialised in psychiatry under the direction of Henri Claude at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, the major psychiatric hospital serving central Paris, at the Infirmary for the Insane of the Police Prefecture under Gaëtan Gatian de Clérambault and also at the Hospital Henri-Rousselle.\n\nLacan was involved with the Parisian surrealist movement of the 1930s associating with André Breton, Georges Bataille, Salvador Dalí, and Pablo Picasso. For a time, he served as Picasso's personal therapist. He attended the \"mouvement Psyché\" that Maryse Choisy founded and published in the Surrealist journal \"Minotaure\". \"[Lacan's] interest in surrealism predated his interest in psychoanalysis,\" former Lacanian analyst and biographer Dylan Evans explains, speculating that \"perhaps Lacan never really abandoned his early surrealist sympathies, its neo-Romantic view of madness as 'convulsive beauty', its celebration of irrationality.\" Translator and historian David Macey writes that \"the importance of surrealism can hardly be over-stated... to the young Lacan... [who] also shared the surrealists' taste for scandal and provocation, and viewed provocation as an important element in psycho-analysis itself\".\n\nIn 1931, after a second year at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, Lacan was awarded his \"Diplôme de médecin légiste\" (a medical examiner's qualification) and became a licensed forensic psychiatrist. The following year he was awarded his (roughly equivalent to an M.D. degree) for his thesis \"On Paranoiac Psychosis in its Relations to the Personality\" (\"De la Psychose paranoïaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalité\". Its publication had little immediate impact on French psychoanalysis but it did meet with acclaim amongst Lacan's circle of surrealist writers and artists. In their only recorded instance of direct communication, Lacan sent a copy of his thesis to Sigmund Freud who acknowledged its receipt with a postcard.\nLacan's thesis was based on observations of several patients with a primary focus on one female patient whom he called Aimée. Its exhaustive reconstruction of her family history and social relations, on which he based his analysis of her paranoid state of mind, demonstrated his dissatisfaction with traditional psychiatry and the growing influence of Freud on his ideas. Also in 1932, Lacan published a translation of Freud's 1922 text, \"\"Über einige neurotische Mechanismen bei Eifersucht, Paranoia und Homosexualität\"\" (\"Some Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia and Homosexuality\") as \"\"De quelques mécanismes névrotiques dans la jalousie, la paranoïa et l'homosexualité\"\" in the \"\". In Autumn 1932, Lacan began his training analysis with Rudolph Loewenstein, which was to last until 1938.\n\nIn 1934 Lacan became a candidate member of the Société psychanalytique de Paris (SPP). He began his private psychoanalytic practice in 1936 whilst still seeing patients at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, and the same year presented his first analytic report at the Congress of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) in Marienbad on the \"Mirror Phase\". The congress chairman, Ernest Jones, terminated the lecture before its conclusion, since he was unwilling to extend Lacan's stated presentation time. Insulted, Lacan left the congress to witness the Berlin Olympic Games. No copy of the original lecture remains, Lacan having decided not to hand in his text for publication in the conference proceedings.\n\nLacan's attendance at Kojève's lectures on Hegel, given between 1933 and 1939, and which focused on the \"Phenomenology\" and the master-slave dialectic in particular, was formative for his subsequent work, initially in his formulation of his theory of the Mirror Phase, for which he was also indebted to the experimental work on child development of Henri Wallon.\n\nIt was Wallon who commissioned from Lacan the last major text of his pre-war period, a contribution to the 1938 \"Encyclopédie française\" entitled \"\"La Famille\"\" (reprinted in 1984 as “\"Les Complexes familiaux dans la formation de l'individu\"\", Paris: Navarin). 1938 was also the year of Lacan's accession to full membership (\"Membre titulaire\") of the SPP, notwithstanding considerable opposition from many of its senior members who were unimpressed by his recasting of Freudian theory in philosophical terms.\n\nLacan married Marie-Louise Blondin in January 1934 and in January 1937 they had the first of their three children, a daughter named Caroline. A son, Thibaut, was born in August 1939 and a daughter, Sybille, in November 1940.\n\nThe SPP was disbanded due to Nazi Germany's occupation of France in 1940. Lacan was called up for military service which he undertook in periods of duty at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris, whilst at the same time continuing his private psychoanalytic practice. In 1942 he moved into apartments at 5 rue de Lille, which he would occupy until his death. During the war he did not publish any work, turning instead to a study of Chinese for which he obtained a degree from the École spéciale des langues orientales.\n\nIn a relationship they formed before the war, Sylvia Bataille (née Maklès), the estranged wife of his friend Georges Bataille, became Lacan's mistress and, in 1953, his second wife. During the war their relationship was complicated by the threat of deportation for Sylvia, who was Jewish, since this required her to live in the unoccupied territories. Lacan intervened personally with the authorities to obtain papers detailing her family origins, which he destroyed. In 1941 they had a child, Judith. She kept the name Bataille because Lacan wished to delay the announcement of his planned separation and divorce until after the war.\n\nAfter the war, the SPP recommenced their meetings. In 1945 Lacan visited England for a five-week study trip, where he met the British analysts Ernest Jones, Wilfred Bion and John Rickman. Bion's analytic work with groups influenced Lacan, contributing to his own subsequent emphasis on study groups as a structure within which to advance theoretical work in psychoanalysis. He published a report of his visit as 'La Psychiatrique anglaise et la guerre' (\"Evolution psychiatrique\" 1, 1947, pp.  293–318).\n\nIn 1949, Lacan presented a new paper on the mirror stage, 'The Mirror-Stage, as Formative of the I, as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience', to the sixteenth IPA congress in Zurich. The same year he set out in the \"Doctrine de la Commission de l’Enseignement,\" produced for the Training Commission of the SPP, the protocols for the training of candidates.\n\nWith the purchase in 1951 of a country mansion at Guitrancourt, Lacan established a base for weekend retreats for work, leisure - including extravagant social occasions - and for the accommodation of his vast library. His art collection included Courbet’s L'Origine du monde, which he had concealed in his study by a removable wooden screen on which an abstract representation of the Courbet by the artist André Masson was portrayed. \n\nIn 1951, Lacan started to hold a private weekly seminar in Paris in which he inaugurated what he described as \"a return to Freud\" whose doctrines were to be re-articulated through a reading of Saussure’s linguistics and Levi-Strauss’s structuralist anthropology. Becoming public in 1953, Lacan's 27-year-long seminar was highly influential in Parisian cultural life, as well as in psychoanalytic theory and clinical practice. \n\nIn January 1953 Lacan was elected President of the SPP. When, at a meeting the following June, a formal motion was passed against him criticising his abandonment of the standard analytic training session for the variable-length session, he immediately resigned his presidency. He and a number of colleagues then resigned from the SPP to form the Société Française de Psychanalyse (SFP). One consequence of this was to eventually deprive the new group of membership of the International Psychoanalytical Association.\n\nEncouraged by the reception of \"the return to Freud\" and of his report \"The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis\", Lacan began to re-read Freud's works in relation to contemporary philosophy, linguistics, ethnology, biology, and topology. From 1953 to 1964 at the Sainte-Anne Hospital, he held his Seminars and presented case histories of patients. During this period he wrote the texts that are found in the collection \"Écrits\", which was first published in 1966. In his seventh Seminar \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis\" (1959–60), Lacan defined the ethical foundations of psychoanalysis and presented his \"ethics for our time\"—one that would, in the words of Freud, prove to be equal to the tragedy of modern man and to the \"discontent of civilization\". At the roots of the ethics is desire: analysis' only promise is austere, it is the entrance-into-the-I (in French a play on words between \"l'entrée en je\" and \"l'entrée en jeu\"). \"I must come to the place where the id was,\" where the analysand discovers, in its absolute nakedness, the truth of his desire. The end of psychoanalysis entails \"the purification of desire\". This text formed the foundation of Lacan's work for the subsequent years. He defended three assertions: that psychoanalysis must have a scientific status; that Freudian ideas have radically changed the concepts of subject, of knowledge, and of desire; and that the analytic field is the only place from which it is possible to question the insufficiencies of science and philosophy.\n\nStarting in 1962, a complex negotiation took place to determine the status of the SFP within the IPA. Lacan's practice (with its controversial indeterminate-length sessions) and his critical stance towards psychoanalytic orthodoxy led, in August 1963, to the IPA setting the condition that registration of the SFP was dependent upon the removal of Lacan from the list of SFP analysts. With the SFP's decision to honour this request in November 1963, Lacan had effectively been stripped of the right to conduct training analyses and thus was constrained to form his own institution in order to accommodate the many candidates who desired to continue their analyses with him. This he did, on 21 June 1964, in the \"Founding Act\" of what became known as the École Freudienne de Paris (EFP), taking \"many representatives of the third generation with him: among them were Maud and Octave Mannoni, Serge Leclaire ... and Jean Clavreul\".\n\nWith the support of Claude Lévi-Strauss and Louis Althusser, Lacan was appointed lecturer at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. He started with a seminar on \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\" in January 1964 in the Dussane room at the École Normale Supérieure. Lacan began to set forth his own approach to psychoanalysis to an audience of colleagues that had joined him from the SFP. His lectures also attracted many of the École Normale's students. He divided the École freudienne de Paris into three sections: the section of pure psychoanalysis (training and elaboration of the theory, where members who have been analyzed but have not become analysts can participate); the section for applied psychoanalysis (therapeutic and clinical, physicians who either have not started or have not yet completed analysis are welcome); and the section for taking inventory of the Freudian field (concerning the critique of psychoanalytic literature and the analysis of the theoretical relations with related or affiliated sciences). In 1967 he invented the procedure of the Pass, which was added to the statutes after being voted in by the members of the EFP the following year.\n\n1966 saw the publication of Lacan's collected writings, the \"Écrits\", compiled with an index of concepts by Jacques-Alain Miller. Printed by the prestigious publishing house Éditions du Seuil, the \"Écrits\" did much to establish Lacan's reputation to a wider public. The success of the publication led to a subsequent two-volume edition in 1969.\n\nBy the 1960s, Lacan was associated, at least in the public mind, with the far left in France. In May 1968, Lacan voiced his sympathy for the student protests and as a corollary his followers set up a Department of Psychology at the University of Vincennes (Paris VIII). However, Lacan's unequivocal comments in 1971 on revolutionary ideals in politics draw a sharp line between the actions of some of his followers and his own style of \"revolt\".\n\nIn 1969, Lacan moved his public seminars to the Faculté de Droit (Panthéon), where he continued to deliver his expositions of analytic theory and practice until the dissolution of his School in 1980.\n\nThroughout the final decade of his life, Lacan continued his widely followed seminars. During this period, he developed his concepts of masculine and feminine jouissance and placed an increased emphasis on the concept of \"the Real\" as a point of impossible contradiction in the \"Symbolic order\". Lacan continued to draw widely on various disciplines, working closely on classical Chinese literature with François Cheng and on the life and work of James Joyce with Jacques Aubert.\nThe growing success of the \"Écrits\", which was translated (in abridged form) into German and English, led to invitations to lecture in Italy, Japan and the United States. He gave lectures in 1975 at Yale, Columbia and MIT.\n\nLacan's failing health made it difficult for him to meet the demands of the year-long Seminars he had been delivering since the fifties, but his teaching continued into the first year of the eighties. After dissolving his School, the EFP, in January 1980, Lacan travelled to Caracas to found the Freudian Field Institute on 12 July.\n\nThe Overture to the Caracas Encounter was to be Lacan's final public address. His last texts from the spring of 1981 are brief institutional documents pertaining to the newly formed Freudian Field Institute.\n\nLacan died on 9 September 1981.\n\nLacan's \"return to Freud\" emphasizes a renewed attention to the original texts of Freud, and included a radical critique of ego psychology, whereas \"Lacan's quarrel with Object Relations psychoanalysis\" was a more muted affair. Here he attempted \"to restore to the notion of the Object Relation... the capital of experience that legitimately belongs to it\", building upon what he termed \"the hesitant, but controlled work of Melanie Klein... Through her we know the function of the imaginary primordial enclosure formed by the \"imago\" of the mother's body\", as well as upon \"the notion of the transitional object, introduced by D. W. Winnicott... a key-point for the explanation of the genesis of fetishism\". Nevertheless, \"Lacan systematically questioned those psychoanalytic developments from the 1930s to the 1970s, which were increasingly and almost exclusively focused on the child's early relations with the mother... the pre-Oedipal or Kleinian mother\"; and Lacan's rereading of Freud—\"characteristically, Lacan insists that his return to Freud supplies the only valid model\"—formed a basic conceptual starting-point in that oppositional strategy.\n\nLacan thought that Freud's ideas of \"slips of the tongue\", jokes, and the interpretation of dreams all emphasized the agency of language in subjective constitution. In \"The Instance of the Letter in the Unconscious, or Reason Since Freud,\" he proposes that \"the unconscious is structured like a language.\" The unconscious is not a primitive or archetypal part of the mind separate from the conscious, linguistic ego, he explained, but rather a formation as complex and structurally sophisticated as consciousness itself. One consequence of his idea that the unconscious is structured like a language is that the self is denied any point of reference to which to be \"restored\" following trauma or a crisis of identity.\n\nAndré Green objected that \"when you read Freud, it is obvious that this proposition doesn't work for a minute. Freud very clearly opposes the unconscious (which he says is constituted by thing-presentations and nothing else) to the pre-conscious. What is related to language can only belong to the pre-conscious\". Freud certainly contrasted \"the presentation of the \"word\" and the presentation of the \"thing\"... the unconscious presentation is the presentation of the thing alone\" in his metapsychology. Dylan Evans, however, in his \"Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis,\" \"... takes issue with those who, like André Green, question the linguistic aspect of the unconscious, emphasizing Lacan's distinction between \"das Ding\" and \"die Sache\" in Freud's account of thing-presentation\". Green's criticism of Lacan also included accusations of intellectual dishonesty, he said, \"[He] cheated everybody... the return to Freud was an excuse, it just meant going to Lacan.\"\n\nLacan's first official contribution to psychoanalysis was the mirror stage, which he described as \"formative of the function of the \"I\" as revealed in psychoanalytic experience.\" By the early 1950s, he came to regard the mirror stage as more than a moment in the life of the infant; instead, it formed part of the permanent structure of subjectivity. In \"the Imaginary order,\" the subject's own image permanently catches and captivates the subject. Lacan explains that \"the mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body-image\".\n\nAs this concept developed further, the stress fell less on its historical value and more on its structural value. In his fourth Seminar, \"La relation d'objet,\" Lacan states that \"the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship. \"\n\nThe mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which is perceived as a fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan understands this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.\n\nLacan calls the specular image \"orthopaedic,\" since it leads the child to anticipate the overcoming of its \"real specific prematurity of birth.\" The vision of the body as integrated and contained, in opposition to the child's actual experience of motor incapacity and the sense of his or her body as fragmented, induces a movement from \"insufficiency to anticipation.\" In other words, the mirror image initiates and then aids, like a crutch, the process of the formation of an integrated sense of self.\n\nIn the mirror stage a \"misunderstanding\" (\"méconnaissance\") constitutes the Ego—the \"me\" (\"moi\") becomes alienated from itself through the introduction of an imaginary dimension to the subject. The mirror stage also has a significant symbolic dimension, due to the presence of the figure of the adult who carries the infant. Having jubilantly assumed the image as their own, the child turns their head towards this adult, who represents the big Other, as if to call on the adult to ratify this image.\n\nWhile Freud uses the term \"other\", referring to \"der Andere\" (the other person) and \"das Andere\" (otherness), Lacan (influenced by the seminar of Alexandre Kojève) theorizes alterity in a manner more closely resembling Hegel's philosophy.\n\nLacan often used an algebraic symbology for his concepts: the big Other (l'Autre) is designated A, and the little other (l'autre) is designated \"a\". He asserts that an awareness of this distinction is fundamental to analytic practice: \"the analyst must be imbued with the difference between A and \"a\", so he can situate himself in the place of Other, and not the other.\" Dylan Evans explains that:\n\nBULLET::::1. The little other is the other who is not really other, but a reflection and projection of the Ego. Evans adds that for this reason the symbol \"a\" can represent both the little other and the ego in the Schema L. It is simultaneously the counterpart and the specular image. The little other is thus entirely inscribed in the Imaginary order.\nBULLET::::2. The big Other designates radical alterity, an other-ness which transcends the illusory otherness of the imaginary because it cannot be assimilated through identification. Lacan equates this radical alterity with language and the law, and hence the big Other is inscribed in the order of the symbolic. Indeed, the big Other \"is\" the symbolic insofar as it is particularized for each subject. The Other is thus both another subject, in his radical alterity and unassimilable uniqueness, and also the symbolic order which mediates the relationship with that other subject.\"\n\nFor Lacan \"the Other must first of all be considered a locus in which speech is constituted,\" so that the Other as another subject is secondary to the Other as symbolic order. We can speak of the Other \"as a subject\" in a secondary sense only when a subject occupies this position and thereby embodies the Other for another subject.\n\nIn arguing that speech originates in neither the Ego nor in the subject but rather in the Other, Lacan stresses that speech and language are beyond the subject's conscious control. They come from another place, outside of consciousness—\"the unconscious is the discourse of the Other.\" When conceiving the Other as a place, Lacan refers to Freud's concept of psychical locality, in which the unconscious is described as \"the other scene\".\n\n\"It is the mother who first occupies the position of the big Other for the child,\" Dylan Evans explains, \"it is she who receives the child's primitive cries and retroactively sanctions them as a particular message\". The castration complex is formed when the child discovers that this Other is not complete because there is a \"Lack (manque)\" in the Other. This means that there is always a signifier missing from the trove of signifiers constituted by the Other. Lacan illustrates this incomplete Other graphically by striking a bar through the symbol A; hence another name for the castrated, incomplete Other is the \"barred Other.\"\n\nFeminist thinkers have both utilised and criticised Lacan's concepts of castration and the Phallus. Feminists such as Avital Ronell, Jane Gallop, and Elizabeth Grosz, have interpreted Lacan's work as opening up new possibilities for feminist theory.\n\nSome feminists have argued that Lacan's phallocentric analysis provides a useful means of understanding gender biases and imposed roles, while other feminist critics, most notably Luce Irigaray, accuse Lacan of maintaining the sexist tradition in psychoanalysis. For Irigaray, the Phallus does not define a single axis of gender by its presence/absence; instead, gender has two positive poles. Like Irigaray, French philosopher Jacques Derrida, in criticizing Lacan's concept of castration, discusses the phallus in a chiasmus with the hymen, as both one and other.\n\nThe Imaginary is the field of images and imagination. The main illusions of this order are synthesis, autonomy, duality, and resemblance. Lacan thought that the relationship created within the mirror stage between the Ego and the reflected image means that the Ego and the Imaginary order itself are places of radical alienation: \"alienation is constitutive of the Imaginary order.\" This relationship is also narcissistic.\n\nIn \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\", Lacan argues that the Symbolic order structures the visual field of the Imaginary, which means that it involves a linguistic dimension. If the signifier is the foundation of the Symbolic, the signified and signification are part of the Imaginary order. Language has Symbolic and Imaginary connotations—in its Imaginary aspect, language is the \"wall of language\" that inverts and distorts the discourse of the Other. On the other hand, the Imaginary is rooted in the subject's relationship with his or her own body (the image of the body). In \"Fetishism: the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real\", Lacan argues that in the sexual plane the Imaginary appears as sexual display and courtship love.\n\nInsofar as identification with the analyst is the objective of analysis, Lacan accused major psychoanalytic schools of reducing the practice of psychoanalysis to the Imaginary order. Instead, Lacan proposes the use of the Symbolic to dislodge the disabling fixations of the Imaginary—the analyst transforms the images into words. \"The use of the Symbolic,\" he argued, \"is the only way for the analytic process to cross the plane of identification.\"\n\nIn his Seminar IV, \"La relation d'objet\", Lacan argues that the concepts of \"Law\" and \"Structure\" are unthinkable without language—thus the Symbolic is a linguistic dimension. This order is not equivalent to language, however, since language involves the Imaginary and the Real as well. The dimension proper to language in the Symbolic is that of the signifier—that is, a dimension in which elements have no positive existence, but which are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.\n\nThe Symbolic is also the field of radical alterity—that is, the Other; the unconscious is the discourse of this Other. It is the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the Oedipus complex. The Symbolic is the domain of culture as opposed to the Imaginary order of nature. As important elements in the Symbolic, the concepts of death and lack (manque) connive to make of the pleasure principle the regulator of the distance from the Thing (\"\"das Ding an sich\"\") and the death drive that goes \"beyond the pleasure principle by means of repetition\"—\"the death drive is only a mask of the Symbolic order.\"\n\nBy working in the Symbolic order, the analyst is able to produce changes in the subjective position of the analysand. These changes will produce imaginary effects because the Imaginary is structured by the Symbolic.\n\nLacan's concept of the Real dates back to 1936 and his doctoral thesis on psychosis. It was a term that was popular at the time, particularly with Émile Meyerson, who referred to it as \"an ontological absolute, a true being-in-itself\". Lacan returned to the theme of the Real in 1953 and continued to develop it until his death. The Real, for Lacan, is not synonymous with reality. Not only opposed to the Imaginary, the Real is also exterior to the Symbolic. Unlike the latter, which is constituted in terms of oppositions (i.e. presence/absence), \"there is no absence in the Real.\" Whereas the Symbolic opposition \"presence/absence\" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the Symbolic, \"the Real is always in its place.\" If the Symbolic is a set of differentiated elements (signifiers), the Real in itself is undifferentiated—it bears no fissure. The Symbolic introduces \"a cut in the real\" in the process of signification: \"it is the world of words that creates the world of things—things originally confused in the \"here and now\" of the all in the process of coming into being.\" The Real is that which is outside language and that resists symbolization absolutely. In Seminar XI Lacan defines the Real as \"the impossible\" because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the Symbolic, and impossible to attain. It is this resistance to symbolization that lends the Real its traumatic quality. Finally, the Real is the object of anxiety, insofar as it lacks any possible mediation and is \"the essential object which is not an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety par excellence.\"\n\nLacan's concept of desire is related to Hegel's \"Begierde\", a term that implies a continuous force, and therefore somehow differs from Freud's concept of \"Wunsch\". Lacan's desire refers always to unconscious desire because it is unconscious desire that forms the central concern of psychoanalysis.\n\nThe aim of psychoanalysis is to lead the analysand to recognize his/her desire and by doing so to uncover the truth about his/her desire. However this is possible only if desire is articulated in speech: \"It is only once it is formulated, named in the presence of the other, that desire appears in the full sense of the term.\" And again in \"The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis\": \"...what is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence. The subject should come to recognize and to name her/his desire. But it isn't a question of recognizing something that could be entirely given. In naming it, the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the world.\" The truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, although discourse is never able to articulate the entire truth about desire, whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover or surplus.\n\nLacan distinguishes desire from need and from demand. Need is a biological instinct where the subject depends on the Other to satisfy its own needs: in order to get the Other's help \"need\" must be articulated in \"demand.\" But the presence of the Other not only ensures the satisfaction of the \"need\", it also represents the Other's love. Consequently, \"demand\" acquires a double function: on the one hand, it articulates \"need\", and on the other, acts as a \"demand for love.\" Even after the \"need\" articulated in demand is satisfied, the \"demand for love\" remains unsatisfied since the Other cannot provide the unconditional love that the subject seeks. \"Desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction, nor the demand for love, but the difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second.\" Desire is a surplus, a leftover, produced by the articulation of need in demand: \"desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need.\" Unlike need, which can be satisfied, desire can never be satisfied: it is constant in its pressure and eternal. The attainment of desire does not consist in being fulfilled but in its reproduction as such. As Slavoj Žižek puts it, \"desire's \"raison d'être\" is not to realize its goal, to find full satisfaction, but to reproduce itself as desire.\"\n\nLacan also distinguishes between desire and the drives: desire is one and drives are many. The drives are the partial manifestations of a single force called desire. Lacan's concept of \"\"objet petit a\"\" is the object of desire, although this object is not that towards which desire tends, but rather the cause of desire. Desire is not a relation to an object but a relation to a lack (manque).\n\nIn \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis\" Lacan argues that \"man's desire is the desire of the Other.\" This entails the following:\nBULLET::::1. Desire is the desire of the Other's desire, meaning that desire is the object of another's desire and that desire is also desire for recognition. Here Lacan follows Alexandre Kojève who follows Hegel: for Kojève the subject must risk his own life if he wants to achieve the desired prestige.\" This desire to be the object of another's desire is best exemplified in the Oedipus complex, when the subject desires to be the phallus of the mother.\nBULLET::::2. In \"The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious\", Lacan contends that the subject desires from the point of view of another whereby the object of someone's desire is an object desired by another one: what makes the object desirable is that it is precisely desired by someone else. Again Lacan follows Kojève who follows Hegel. This aspect of desire is present in hysteria for the hysteric is someone who converts another's desire into his/her own (see Sigmund Freud's \"Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria\" in SE VII, where Dora desires Frau K because she identifies with Herr K). What matters then in the analysis of a hysteric is not to find out the object of her desire but to discover the subject with whom she identifies.\nBULLET::::3. \"Désir de l'Autre\", which is translated as \"desire for the Other\" (though could be also \"desire of the Other\"). The fundamental desire is the incestuous desire for the mother, the primordial Other.\nBULLET::::4. Desire is \"the desire for something else\" since it is impossible to desire what one already has. The object of desire is continually deferred, which is why desire is a metonymy.\nBULLET::::5. Desire appears in the field of the Other, that is in the unconscious.\n\nLast but not least for Lacan the first person who occupies the place of the Other is the mother and at first the child is at her mercy. Only when the father articulates desire with the law by castrating the mother, the subject is liberated from the mother's desire.\n\nLacan maintains Freud's distinction between drive (\"Trieb\") and instinct (\"Instinkt\"). Drives differ from biological needs because they can never be satisfied and do not aim at an object but rather circle perpetually around it. He argues that the purpose of the drive (\"Triebziel\") is not to reach a goal but to follow its aim, meaning \"the way itself\" instead of \"the final destination\", that is to circle around the object. The purpose of the drive is to return to its circular path and the true source of jouissance is the repetitive movement of this closed circuit. Lacan posits the drives as both cultural and symbolic constructs—to him, \"the drive is not a given, something archaic, primordial.\" He incorporates the four elements of the drives as defined by Freud (the pressure, the end, the object and the source) to his theory of the drive's circuit: the drive originates in the erogenous zone, circles round the object, and returns to the erogenous zone. Three grammatical voices structure this circuit:\nBULLET::::1. the active voice (to see)\nBULLET::::2. the reflexive voice (to see oneself)\nBULLET::::3. the passive voice (to be seen)\nThe active and reflexive voices are autoerotic—they lack a subject. It is only when the drive completes its circuit with the passive voice that a new subject appears, implying that prior to that instance, there was not subject. Despite being the \"passive\" voice, the drive is essentially active: \"to make oneself be seen\" rather than \"to be seen.\" The circuit of the drive is the only way for the subject to transgress the pleasure principle.\n\nTo Freud sexuality is composed of partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), it is only in puberty that they become organized under the aegis of the genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that they are a part of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.\n\nLacan identifies four partial drives: the oral drive (the erogenous zones are the lips, the partial object the breast, the verb is \"to suck\"), the anal drive (the anus and the faeces, \"to shit\"), the scopic drive (the eyes and the gaze, \"to see\") and the invocatory drive (the ears and the voice, \"to hear\"). The first two drives relate to demand and the last two to desire.\n\nThe notion of dualism is maintained throughout Freud's various reformulations of the drive-theory. From the initial opposition between sexual drives and ego-drives (self-preservation) to the final one between the life drives (\"Lebenstriebe\") and the death drives (\"Todestriebe\"). Lacan retains Freud's dualism but in terms of an opposition between the symbolic and the imaginary and not referred to different kinds of drives. For Lacan all drives are sexual drives, and every drive is a death drive (\"pulsion de mort\") since every drive is excessive, repetitive and destructive.\n\nThe drives are closely related to desire since both originate in the field of the subject. But they are not to be confused: drives are the partial aspects in which desire is realized—desire is one and undivided, whereas the drives are its partial manifestations. A drive is a demand that is not caught up in the dialectical mediation of desire; drive is a \"mechanical\" insistence that is not ensnared in demand's dialectical mediation.\n\nBULLET::::- Name of the Father\nBULLET::::- Foreclosure (psychoanalysis)\nBULLET::::- Lack (manque)\nBULLET::::- \"Objet petit a\"\n\nBULLET::::- The graph of desire\nBULLET::::- Matheme\nBULLET::::- Sinthome\nBULLET::::- The Four discourses\nBuilding on Freud's \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life\", Lacan long argued that \"every unsuccessful act is a successful, not to say 'well-turned', discourse\", highlighting as well \"sudden transformations of errors into truths, which seemed to be due to nothing more than perseverance\". In a late seminar, he generalised more fully the psychoanalytic discovery of \"truth—arising from misunderstanding\", so as to maintain that \"the subject is naturally erring... discourse structures alone give him his moorings and reference points, signs identify and orient him; if he neglects, forgets, or loses them, he is condemned to err anew\".\n\nBecause of \"the alienation to which speaking beings are subjected due to their being in language\", to survive \"one must let oneself be taken in by signs and become the dupe of a discourse... [of] fictions organized in to a discourse\". For Lacan, with \"masculine knowledge irredeemably an erring\", the individual \"must thus allow himself to be fooled by these signs to have a chance of getting his bearings amidst them; he must place and maintain himself in the wake of a discourse... become the dupe of a discourse... \"les non-dupes errent\"\".\n\nLacan comes close here to one of the points where \"very occasionally he sounds like Thomas Kuhn (whom he never mentions)\", with Lacan's \"discourse\" resembling Kuhn's \"paradigm\" seen as \"the entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the members of a given community\".\n\nThe \"variable-length psychoanalytic session\" was one of Lacan's crucial clinical innovations, and a key element in his conflicts with the IPA, to whom his \"innovation of reducing the fifty-minute analytic hour to a Delphic seven or eight minutes (or sometimes even to a single oracular \"parole\" murmured in the waiting-room)\" was unacceptable. Lacan's variable-length sessions lasted anywhere from a few minutes (or even, if deemed appropriate by the analyst, a few seconds) to several hours. This practice replaced the classical Freudian \"fifty minute hour\".\n\nWith respect to what he called \"the cutting up of the 'timing'\", Lacan asked the question, \"Why make an intervention impossible at this point, which is consequently privileged in this way?\" By allowing the analyst's intervention on timing, the variable-length session removed the patient's—or, technically, \"the analysand's\"—former certainty as to the length of time that they would be on the couch. When Lacan adopted the practice, \"the psychoanalytic establishment were scandalized\"—and, given that \"between 1979 and 1980 he saw an average of ten patients an hour\", it is perhaps not hard to see why: \"psychoanalysis reduced to zero\", if no less lucrative.\n\nAt the time of his original innovation, Lacan described the issue as concerning \"the systematic use of shorter sessions in certain analyses, and in particular in training analyses\"; and in practice it was certainly a shortening of the session around the so-called \"critical moment\" which took place, so that critics wrote that 'everyone is well aware what is meant by the deceptive phrase \"variable length\"... sessions systematically reduced to just a few minutes'. Irrespective of the theoretical merits of breaking up patients' expectations, it was clear that \"the Lacanian analyst never wants to 'shake up' the routine by keeping them for more rather than less time\".\n\n\"Whatever the justification, the practical effects were startling. It does not take a cynic to point out that Lacan was able to take on many more analysands than anyone using classical Freudian techniques... [and] as the technique was adopted by his pupils and followers an almost exponential rate of growth became possible\".\n\nAccepting the importance of \"the critical moment when insight arises\", object relations theory would nonetheless quietly suggest that \"if the analyst does not provide the patient with space in which nothing \"needs\" to happen there is no space in which something \"can\" happen\". Julia Kristeva, if in very different language, would concur that \"Lacan, alert to the scandal of the timeless intrinsic to the analytic experience, was mistaken in wanting to ritualize it as a technique of scansion (short sessions)\".\n\nMost of Lacan's psychoanalytic writings from the forties through to the early sixties were compiled with an index of concepts by Jacques-Alain Miller in the 1966 collection, titled simply \"Écrits\". Published in French by Éditions du Seuil, they were later issued as a two-volume set (1970/1) with a new \"Preface\". A selection of the writings (chosen by Lacan himself) were translated by Alan Sheridan and published by Tavistock Press in 1977. The full 35-text volume appeared for the first time in English in Bruce Fink's translation published by Norton & Co. (2006). The \"Écrits\" were included on the list of 100 most influential books of the 20th century compiled and polled by the broadsheet \"Le Monde\".\n\nLacan's writings from the late sixties and seventies (thus subsequent to the 1966 collection) were collected posthumously, along with some early texts from the nineteen thirties, in the Éditions du Seuil volume \"Autres écrits\" (2001).\n\nAlthough most of the texts in \"Écrits\" and \"Autres écrits\" are closely related to Lacan's lectures or lessons from his Seminar, more often than not the style is denser than Lacan's oral delivery, and a clear distinction between the writings and the transcriptions of the oral teaching is evident to the reader.\n\nJacques-Alain Miller is the sole editor of Lacan's seminars, which contain the majority of his life's work. \"There has been considerable controversy over the accuracy or otherwise of the transcription and editing\", as well as over \"Miller's refusal to allow any critical or annotated edition to be published\". Despite Lacan's status as a major figure in the history of psychoanalysis, some of his seminars remain unpublished. Since 1984, Miller has been regularly conducting a series of lectures, \"L'orientation lacanienne.\" Miller's teachings have been published in the US by the journal \"Lacanian Ink.\"\n\nLacan's writing is notoriously difficult, due in part to the repeated Hegelian/Kojèvean allusions, wide theoretical divergences from other psychoanalytic and philosophical theory, and an obscure prose style. For some, \"the impenetrability of Lacan's prose... [is] too often regarded as profundity precisely because it cannot be understood\". Arguably at least, \"the imitation of his style by other 'Lacanian' commentators\" has resulted in \"an obscurantist antisystematic tradition in Lacanian literature\".\n\nThough a major influence on psychoanalysis in France and parts of Latin America, Lacan's influence on clinical psychology in the English-speaking world is negligible, where his ideas are best known in the arts and humanities. However, there are Lacanian psychoanalytic societies in both North America and the United Kingdom that carry on his work.\n\nOne example of Lacan's work being practiced in the United States is found in the works of Annie G. Rogers (\"A Shining Affliction\"; \"The Unsayable: The Hidden Language of Trauma\"), which credit Lacanian theory for many therapeutic insights in successfully treating sexually abused young women. Lacan's work has also reached Quebec where The Interdisciplinary Freudian Group for Research and Clinical and Cultural Interventions (GIFRIC) claims that they have used a modified form of Lacanian psychoanalysis in successfully treating psychosis in many of its patients, a task once thought to be unsuited for psychoanalysis, even by psychoanalysts themselves.\n\nIn his introduction to the 1994 Penguin edition of Lacan's \"The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis\", translator and historian David Macey describes Lacan as \"the most controversial psycho-analyst since Freud\". His ideas had a significant impact on post-structuralism, critical theory, linguistics, 20th-century French philosophy, film theory, and clinical psychoanalysis.\n\nIn \"Fashionable Nonsense\" (1997), Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticize Lacan's use of terms from mathematical fields such as topology, accusing him of \"superficial erudition\" and of abusing scientific concepts that he does not understand, accusing him of producing statements that are not even wrong. However, they note that they do not want to enter into the debate over the purely psychoanalytic part of Lacan's work.\n\nOther critics have dismissed Lacan's work wholesale. called it an \"incoherent system of pseudo-scientific gibberish\", and quoted linguist Noam Chomsky's opinion that Lacan was an \"amusing and perfectly self-conscious charlatan\". The former Lacanian analyst Dylan Evans (who published a dictionary of Lacanian terms in 1996) eventually dismissed Lacanianism as lacking a sound scientific basis and as harming rather than helping patients, and has criticized Lacan's followers for treating his writings as \"holy writ\". Richard Webster has decried what he sees as Lacan's obscurity, arrogance, and the resultant \"Cult of Lacan\". Others have been more forceful still, describing him as \"The Shrink from Hell\" and listing the many associates—from lovers and family to colleagues, patients, and editors—left damaged in his wake. Roger Scruton included Lacan in his book \"Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left\", and named him as the only 'fool' included in the book—his other targets merely being misguided or frauds.\n\nHis type of charismatic authority has been linked to the many conflicts among his followers and in the analytic schools he was involved with. His intellectual style has also come in for much criticism. Eclectic in his use of sources, Lacan has been seen as concealing his own thought behind the apparent explication of that of others. Thus his \"return to Freud\" was called by Malcolm Bowie \"a complete pattern of dissenting assent to the ideas of Freud Lacan's argument is conducted on Freud's behalf and, at the same time, against him\". Bowie has also suggested that Lacan suffered from both a love of system and a deep-seated opposition to all forms of system.\n\nMany feminist thinkers have drawn attention to faults in Lacan's thought. Philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray accuses Lacan of perpetuating phallocentric mastery in philosophical and psychoanalytic discourse. Others have echoed this accusation, seeing Lacan as trapped in the very phallocentric mastery his language ostensibly sought to undermine. The result—Castoriadis would maintain—was to make all thought depend upon himself, and thus to stifle the capacity for independent thought among all those around him.\n\nTheir difficulties were only reinforced by what Didier Anzieu described as a kind of teasing lure in Lacan's discourse; \"fundamental truths to be revealed but always at some further point\". This was perhaps an aspect of the sadistic narcissism that feminists especially detected in his nature.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with \"Veterans Unplugged\", Noam Chomsky said: \"quite frankly I thought he was a total charlatan. He was just posturing for the television cameras in the way many Paris intellectuals do. Why this is influential, I haven’t the slightest idea. I don’t see anything there that should be influential.\"\n\nSelected works published in English listed below.

{"id": "16154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16154", "title": "Jupiter Ace", "text": "Jupiter Ace\n\nThe Jupiter Ace by Jupiter Cantab was a British home computer of the early 1980s. The Ace differed from other microcomputers of the time in that its programming environment used Forth instead of the more popular BASIC.\n\nAfter Jupiter Cantab ceased trading, the brand was acquired by Boldfield Computing Ltd in 1984, before eventually being sold to Paul Andrews's company Andrews UK Limited in 2015\n\nJupiter Cantab was formed by Richard Altwasser and Steven Vickers. \nBoth had been on the design team for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum: \nAltwasser did some work on the development of the ZX-81 and in the design of the hardware of the Spectrum. Vickers adapted and expanded the 4K ZX-80 ROM to the 8K ZX-81 ROM and wrote most of the ROM for the Spectrum.\n\nThe Jupiter Ace was named after the early British computer, the ACE.\nThe Jupiter ACE is often compared with ZX81 due to its similar size, low cost, and similar form factor. Internally its design is more similar to the ZX Spectrum although the ACE also had a dedicated video memory of 2 KB, partly avoiding the slow down when programs accessed the same bank (same chips) as the video memory. Like the Spectrum, the Ace used black conductive rubber keys.\n\nAudio capabilities were CPU controlled with programmable frequency and duration. Sound output was through a small built-in speaker.\n\nAs was common at the time, it used a common tape recorder instead of disk/tape drives.\nSimilarly, a television was needed as a display - but this was in black and white only, rather than the colour supported by competing models such as the Spectrum.\n\nIts most distinctive characteristic was the choice of Forth, a structured language allowing programs to be written that would run almost as fast as the compiled languages loaded by more expensive computers. Forth was considered well adapted to microcomputers with their small memory and relatively low-performance processors. Forth programs are memory-efficient; as they become bigger, they reuse more previously-defined code. Control structures could be nested to any level, limited only by available memory. This allowed complex programs to be implemented, even allowing recursive programming. The ACE's Forth was \"ten times faster than Basic\" and used less than half the memory (a significant cost percentage of low end computers of the time) of an equivalent program written in interpreted BASIC. It also allowed easy implementation of machine code routines if needed.\n\n! Characteristic !! Value\nAll chars in Charset (based on ASCII-1967) being redefinable.\n\nReferences to the ACE RAM sometimes include the separate 2 KB video memory, which was not available for programming, thus leading to some confusion. Similarly, it is sometimes argued that because of Forth's efficiency, the 1 KB standard RAM was in effect comparable to at least 2 KB on a BASIC system.\n\nACE's Forth was based mostly on Forth-79, with some relevant differences, in particular it added syntax checking to control structures and definer constructions and a few extra words were added based on common BASIC sound, video and tape commands. The implementation lacked some less frequently used Forth words, these being easily implemented if needed. Runtime error checking could be turned off to raise speed by 25% to 50%.\n\nIts Forth was adapted to the disk-less tape-using home computer hardware by being able to save/load user \"compiled vocabularies\", instead of the usual numbered programming blocks used by diskette systems.\n\nDecompiling avoided wasting RAM in simulating an absent Block System, used with both disk and tape drivers (these last not to be confused with tape recorders). As replacement, it included an extra data file, for raw binary data. These solutions were unique to the Jupiter ACE.\n\nTo allow decompile, it distinguished usual Forth definer and compiler words creation, replacing the CREATE .. DOES>, creation pair with:\nBULLET::::1. DEFINER ... DOES> : Create new Defining words, usually used to define and build data structures. Similar to CREATE..DOES usage in standard FORTH. ( Example: Adding Data Structures as Arrays, Records, ... ).\nBULLET::::2. COMPILER .. RUNS> : Create new Compiling words, less frequently used to extend the language with compiler words where CREATE..DOES> is FORTH implementation dependent. ( Example: New Compiler Control Structures as Case, Infinite Loop, ... ).\n\nThese 2 defining pairs, instead of one alone, allowed the ACE to decompile its programs, unlike usual Forth systems. This decompiling ability was a solution to the absence of the more flexible disk system used by Forth. Not storing the source of a Forth program, but compiling the code after editing, it avoided completely the emulation of a disk/tape drive on RAM saving computer memory. It also saved time in reading and writing programs from cassette tape. This tape-friendly and RAM-saving solution was unique to the Jupiter ACE Forth.\n\nAvoiding sources was compensated by storing comments entered in the code with the complied output, traditional compilation would discard such comments. The comments were then recovered on decompiling. As a result of \"code is the source\", modified words (edited) would demand actualization of all code using the one newly edited. This was done with the non standard REDEFINE command.\n\nAlthough not explicitly designed for such a purpose, the compiled forth could be utilised for ROM extensions to the built in system. External ROMs were developed with Ace Forth to be used as control applications.\n\nThe ACE had an 8 KB ROM containing the Forth kernel and operating system, and the predefined dictionary of Forth words in about 5 KB. The remaining 3 KB of ROM supported several functionalities: floating point numbers library and character definitions table, tape recorder access, decompiling and redefining newly re-edited 'words' (i.e. routines). Some of the ROM was written in Z80 machine code, but some was also coded in Forth.\n\nThe next 8 KB were split in 2 blocks of 4 KB each. The video subsystem consumed 2 KB RAM and allowed the user to choose two different priorities, \"Regular\" or \"Overriding\" CPU contention. In the latter case TV Image timings were overidden, allowing more processor time for user programs at the expense of the display, which went blank.\nThe 1 KB of user RAM was only partially decoded, so it echoed in the full 4 KB block address space it resides. That is to say, the user program/data appeared to exist in four different memory locations.\n\nThe 1st 16 KB of the memory map was used for ROM, Video and User available RAM, leaving the 2nd 16KB of the memory map free for RAM extension and 32 KB undefined.\n\nBULLET::::- CPU:\nThe Jupiter Ace was based on the Zilog Z80, which the designers had previous experience of from working on the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.\n\nBULLET::::- Video:\nOne 1K bank allowed redefinition of most of its 128 ASCII based characters in 8×8 pixel bitmap format. The other 1K bank stored the full screen display of 24 rows × 32 columns of characters in black and white. Colour was intended to be achieved as expansion, but although a colour graphics board was designed, none was ever produced commercially.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Memory\":\n1 KB RAM with the option of a 16 KB RAM-Pack, and later a 32k one. A PCB was also marketed by Boldfield Computing that converted the edge connector to electrical compatibility with a Sinclair ZX81, allowing use of the ZX81 16K RAM pack.\n\nBULLET::::- Sound:\nInternal speaker directly controlled by the CPU in single task mode, with control of sound frequency and duration in ms.\n\nBULLET::::- External Storage:\nStorage was through a cassette tape interface at 1500 baud. \n\nThe machine was able to use some ZX-81 add-ons due to similar RAM locations, and external expansion slot. Jupiter Cantab made a 16 KB RAM pack, and external companies made similar RAM packs as well as other peripherals and interfaces.\n\nSales to the general public were slow. Initially the computer was only available by mail order, and Jupiter Cantab reported that there were production difficulties, but these had been overcome by January 1983 and that units were arriving in shops. The use of Forth rather than the more usual choice of BASIC, and the availability and success of the ZX Spectrum, as well as limited published software, the poor case and small initial memory all weighed against wider market acceptance.\n\n1982 - Original Jupiter ACE in a vacuum-drawn case - Reported 5000 units built.\n\n1983 - Jupiter ACE 4000 on stronger injection moulded case - Reported 800 units built.\n\nSales of the machine were never very large; the reported number of Ace's sold before Jupiter Cantab closed for business was around 5,000. As of the early 2000s, surviving machines are uncommon, often fetching high prices as collector's items.\n\nForth, while being structured and powerful, was considered difficult to learn, and a knowledge of BASIC acquired from familiarity with other home computers was of no practical help in learning it. A 1982 review stated that \"The success of the Jupiter Ace will depend on the machine-buying public's acceptance of another microcomputer language.\" \n\nFurther, there was only a very limited range of published software - either commercial programs or type-in programs printed in hobby magazines - for the machine, and these were restricted by the base model's small amount of RAM.\n\nAttempts to promote the Ace in the educational market also failed; doubts over whether Forth would be relevant for exam syllabuses, and the lack of support for Forth from teaching staff were key issues. Pupils were more interested in learning the widely used BASIC than a language used by only one (uncommon) machine with a peculiar RPN syntax.\n\nFinally, the tile-based graphics compared poorly to the pixel-based graphics of other machines - which were also colour rather than the Ace's monochrome. This restricted sales largely to a niche market of technical programming enthusiasts.\n\nOther Forth-based microcomputers:\nBULLET::::- The Canon Cat\n\nBULLET::::- Jupiter Ace Resource Site: The Jupiter Ace restoration and preservation project.\nBULLET::::- ACE-ROM-PROJECT: latest e-book with hardware considerations (Zip file).\nBULLET::::- theregister.co.uk: The Jupiter Ace is 30, schematic (2012)\n"}
{"id": "16156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16156", "title": "Jacksonville Jaguars", "text": "Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars are a professional football franchise based in Jacksonville, Florida. The Jaguars compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at TIAA Bank Field.\n\nThe Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers joined the NFL as expansion teams for the 1995 season. Since their inception, the Jaguars have won division championships in 1998 and 1999 (as members of the now-defunct AFC Central) and 2017 (as members of the AFC South) and have qualified for the playoffs seven times, most recently in 2017 after a ten-season playoff drought.\n\nFrom their inception until 2011, the Jacksonville Jaguars' majority owner was Wayne Weaver. The team was then purchased by Pakistani-born businessman Shahid Khan for an estimated $770 million. In 2015, Forbes estimated the team value at $1.48 billion. \n\nThe day after the NFL awarded the expansion team to Jacksonville, a triumphant Wayne Weaver held up the Jaguars' proposed silver helmet and teal jersey at the NFL owners' meeting in Chicago. The team's colors were to be teal, gold, and silver with black accents. However, this jersey and helmet design, with a gold leaping jaguar, created controversy. Ford Motor Company, then-parent of the automaker Jaguar, believed that the Jaguars' logo bore too much resemblance to the automaker's logo. Though no lawsuit was brought to trial, lawyers from the team and the automaker negotiated an ultimately amicable agreement whereby Jaguar would be named the official car of the Jaguars, and the Jaguars would redesign their uniforms.\n\nThe new logo was a snarling jaguar head with a teal tongue, which Weaver said was his wife's touch. He also claimed that the teal tongue came from \"feeding Panthers to our Jaguars\" — an obvious jab at their expansion brethren. During the Jaguars' first ever preseason game teal-colored candies were handed out to all the fans who attended, turning their tongues a teal color just like on the logo. Additionally, raspberry lollipops were handed out by the \"Candy Man\" in section 142 to also turn the home fans' tongues teal.\n\nIn 2009, Weaver announced that he wanted to 'clean up' the team's image. This meant the elimination of the full-body crawling Jaguar logo, the clawing Jaguar, and the two previous wordmarks which bent the text around these logos.\n\nIn February 2013, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, who had acquired the team in late 2011, introduced a new brand identity for the team that included a new logo, wordmark, and secondary logo. The new Jaguar head logo was intended to be \"fiercer\" and more realistic. The secondary logo incorporated the new Jaguar head logo along with the first official usage of the team's popular nickname \"Jags\". The two images were encased in a shield-style shape, designed to be a tribute to Jacksonville's military community.\n\nBeginning in 2013, the Jaguars began to feature gold more prominently than in the past. In fact, from 2009–12 gold had only been used in the team logo and as a minor accent color.\n\nFor most of their history, the Jaguars have done what many other NFL teams located in subtropical climates traditionally practice: wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season — forcing opponents to wear their dark ones under the sweltering autumns in Jacksonville. The only exceptions were in 2004 and 2008–10, when the Jaguars chose to wear teal for all home games. In the preseason, the Jaguars typically wear teal at home since these games are played at night when there is very little advantage with the heat.\n\nFollowing the logo change, the redesigned uniforms featured an all-black helmet, white pants with teal, black, and gold stripes, and numbers with gold inner trim and black outer trim. The home jersey was teal with white numbers and the away jersey was white with teal numbers. Both jerseys had a black collar and no sleeve stripes.\n\nA prowling jaguar on each sleeve replaced the leaping jaguar going across both shoulders in the original design. The Jaguars in 1995 were the first NFL team to have 2-tone borders on their numbers and lettering, and the first NFL team to show a complex logo (the crawling Jaguar) on the sleeve.\n\nMinor modifications were introduced to the Jaguars uniform during this time, most notably the font of the jersey numbers, replacing the original block numbers with a unique font. Two stripes were also added to the end of the sleeves below the prowling jaguar.\n\nDuring this period, the Jaguars made minor changes to their uniform, each time adding more black to the look.\n\nThe team introduced a black alternate jersey in 2002. During that same year, the team also introduced alternate black pants, worn with either the white or the teal jersey. After the black pants were introduced, the white pants would only be seen for the first few games of the year, presumably due to the heat. The black pants originally included two teal stripes down each side. The fan reaction to the extra black in the alternate jersey and alternate pants was positive, so in 2004 the Jaguars went through a formal uniform change, which teams are only allowed to do once every five years. These changes were mostly to the away look. Before 2004, the white away jerseys had teal numbers with black and gold trim, but after, the white jerseys had black numbers with teal and gold trim. The black pants were also changed. The teal stripes were replaced with the Jaguar logo on each hip. Teal almost disappeared from the away uniform.\n\nThe stripes on the white pants were altered in 2008 so that the center, thickest stripe was black, and its accents were teal. In the 2008 year, the gold in the uniforms noticeably shifted from a bright yellow metallic appearance to more beige.\n\nThe Jaguars unveiled new uniforms for the 2009 season. Team owner Wayne Weaver reportedly wanted to \"clean up\" the look, feeling that the team had too many uniform styles. The new uniforms were introduced in a press conference on April 22.\n\nAt this press conference, Weaver elaborated that different people had taken different liberties with the Jaguars' image over the years, singling out the 'All Black' look which the team wore for every prime-time home game from 2003 to 2007 as a point of regret. He also said that the team would wear their teal jerseys at home even on hot days, saying that the practice of choosing to wear white on hot days had also diluted the team's image. The new uniform reflected a simpler look overall. The collar and sleeve ends are the same color as the rest of the jersey. The crawling jaguar was removed. The numbers on the jerseys were changed to a simpler, block font with a thicker, single color border. After all of these subtractions, two features were added. The first was a \"JAGUARS\" wordmark underneath the NFL insignia on the chest. The second was two thin 'stripes' of off-color fabric which were added to each midseam of the jersey, curling up to the neckline on the front and below the number on the back. The stripe on the home jersey is a white line next to a black line, matching the color of the numbers, and the stripe on the away jersey is a black line next to a teal line, again matching the numbers. The pants have similar stripes, both for the home and away uniform. The away uniforms were still black pants and numbers on a white jersey, but they now used teal as the only accent color as opposed to using gold in previous years. The Jaguars' identity, in terms of colors, beginning in 2009 is exclusively teal and black, with gold only being used in the logo. The final change made to the Jaguars' uniforms in 2009 was to the helmet. The new helmet and facemask were black just like the old ones, but when light hit the new ones a certain way, both the helmet and face mask sparkled with a shiny teal appearance. These were the first helmets in professional football which changed color with different angles of light. The logo and number decals also incorporated this effect.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, new Jaguars owner Shahid Khan announced that the team would once again use a black jersey, something they had not done since 2008. In September of that year, the team announced that it would use the black jersey and black pants as their primary home uniform. The teal jersey was resurrected as an alternate.\n\nOn April 23, 2013, the Jaguars unveiled new uniforms designed by Nike. The primary home jersey is black with white numerals outlined in teal and gold. The road jersey is white with teal numerals outlined in black and gold, marking the first time since 2003 that the team has used teal numbers on their road jersey. The alternate jersey is teal with black numerals outlined in white and gold. The team had never before used black numbers on their teal jersey. All three jerseys feature a contrasting stripe that bends around the neck, and semi-glossy patches on the shoulders meant to resemble claw marks. The team added their new shield logo onto a patch just above the player's heart, meant to pay tribute to Jacksonville's military heritage.\n\nThe helmet, first of its kind in the NFL, featured a glossy gold finish in the back that fades to matte black in the front, via a color gradient.\n\nThe new uniform set includes black and white pants with the Jaguars logo on the hip and a tri-color pattern down the player's leg.\n\nIn November 2015, as one of eight teams participating in Nike's \"Color Rush\" initiative for four games of \"Thursday Night Football\" during the 2015 season, Jacksonville introduced an all-gold second alternative uniform. The set features a gold jersey with black sleeves and black trim, as well as all gold pants. The white front and back numbers are lined in the teal accent color and bordered by black. The TV numbers on the shoulders are white with black bordering. The set also features gold undershirts and socks.\n\nOn April 19, 2018, the Jaguars again revealed re-designed uniforms. The new design returns to an all-black gloss helmet and removes many of the complicated details from the previous set. For the first time, there will be no borders at all on any of the jersey numbers. There are no stripes or team logo on the pants; only an NFL logo and a Nike logo, which is the first and only of its kind in the NFL. Like the 2009 uniform set, the only gold in the uniform set belongs to the Jaguar logo itself, and the block number font is not distinct from that used by other teams. The sleeve trim and collar trim are both a different color than the rest of the jersey, that and the solitary Jaguar logo are the only distinct markings on the jersey. For the first time, the sock has a teal stripe between the black and white. The black jersey is the primary, as it has been since 2012, and the teal is the alternate.\n\nSince his introduction in 1996, Jaxson de Ville has served as the Jaguars' mascot. Jaxson entertains the crowd before and during games with his antics. The mascot has established a reputation for making dramatic entrances including bungee jumping off the stadium lights, sliding down a rope from the scoreboard, and parachuting into the stadium.\n\nJaxson's antics got him into trouble in 1998 and stemmed the changing of the NFL's mascot rules, and also caused him to calm down. However, Jaxson was still seen, by some, as a mascot that gets in the way during the game. After the October 22, 2007 game against Indianapolis, Colts President Bill Polian complained to the NFL, and Jaxson was reprimanded again.\n\nJaxson's first appearance was on August 18, 1996 and was played by Curtis Dvorak from his inception until his retirement in June 2015.\n\nThe Jacksonville Roar is the professional cheerleading squad of the Jaguars. The group was established in 1995, the team's inaugural year, and regularly performs choreographed routines during the team's home contests.\n\nIn addition to performing at games and pep rallies, members function as goodwill ambassadors of the team, participating in corporate, community, and charitable events in the Jacksonville metropolitan area where they sign autographs and pose for pictures. They also join NFL tours to entertain American servicemen and women around the world.\n\nTIAA Bank Field (formerly known as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, Alltel Stadium, and EverBank Field) is located on the north bank of the St. Johns River, and has been the home of the Jaguars since the team's first season in 1995. The stadium has a capacity of 69,132, with additional seating added during Florida–Georgia Game and the Gator Bowl.\n\nThe stadium served as the site of Super Bowl XXXIX in addition to four Jaguar playoff games including the . It also hosted the ACC Championship Game from 2005–07 and the River City Showdown in 2007 and 2008.\n\nFrom 1995–97 and again from 2006–09, the stadium was named Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. From 1997–2006, the stadium was referred to as Alltel Stadium. The naming rights were purchased by EverBank prior to the 2010 season. Prior to the 2018 season the Jaguars announced the stadium would be renamed TIAA Bank Field.\n\nThe stadium got a substantial upgrade in 2014 with the addition of new scoreboards, pools, cabana seating and premium seating that includes 180 field-level seats. The scoreboards are 60 feet high and 362 feet long. The new scoreboards at TIAA Bank Field are now the world's largest video boards. Two 25 feet by 12 feet pools were installed in the north and south end zones along with the cabana seating. The stadium upgrades were $63 million that owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the total cost.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have three primary rivals: their divisional rivals (Tennessee Titans, Indianapolis Colts, and Houston Texans). They have geographic rivalries with the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Jaguars also have a rivalry with their 1995 expansion brethren, the Carolina Panthers. They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from the AFC Central days, most notably with the Pittsburgh Steelers, who they competed against and defeated in 2017 regular season and the 2017 playoffs. Arguably, a rivalry has also emerged with the Buffalo Bills as of late.\n\nThis is a partial list of the Jaguars' last five completed seasons.

It was unveiled during the 2006 season during a game against the New York Jets on October 8. Former offensive tackle Tony Boselli was the first player inducted.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, team owner Wayne Weaver and his wife Delores were added to the Pride of the Jaguars in their final game before the sale of the team to Shahid Khan. On June 7, 2012 the Jaguars announced Fred Taylor would be the next inductee into the Pride of the Jaguars. He was officially inducted on September 30, 2012. Longtime Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell was also inducted into the \"Pride of the Jaguars\" on December 15, 2013.

{"id": "16158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16158", "title": "Jutes", "text": "Jutes\n\nThe Jutes (), Iuti, or Iutæ were a Germanic people. According to Bede, the Jutes were one of the three most powerful Germanic peoples of their time in the Nordic Iron Age, the other two being the Saxons and the Angles.\n\nThe Jutes are believed to have originated from the Jutland Peninsula (called \"Iutum\" in Latin) and part of the North Frisian coast. In present times, the Jutlandic Peninsula consists of the mainland of Denmark and Southern Schleswig in Germany. North Frisia is also part of Germany.\n\nThe Jutes invaded and settled in southern Britain in the late fourth century during the Age of Migrations, as part of a larger wave of Germanic settlement in the British Isles.\n\nBede places the homeland of the Jutes on the other side of the Angles relative to the Saxons, which would mean the northern part of the Jutland Peninsula. Tacitus portrays a people called the Eudoses living in the north of Jutland, and these may have been the later Iutae. The Jutes have also been identified with the Eotenas (\"ēotenas\") involved in the Frisian conflict with the Danes as described in the Finnesburg episode in the poem \"Beowulf\" (lines 1068–1159). Others have interpreted the \"ēotenas\" as \"jotuns\" (\"ettins\" in English), meaning giants, or as a kenning for \"enemies\".\n\nDisagreeing with Bede, some historians identify the Jutes with the people called Eucii (or \"Saxones Eucii\"), who were evidently associated with the Saxons and dependents of the Franks in 536. The Eucii may have been identical to a little-documented tribe called the Euthiones (Ευθίωνες in Ancient Greek) and probably associated with the Saxons. The Euthiones are mentioned in a poem by Venantius Fortunatus (583) as being under the suzerainty of Chilperic I of the Franks. This identification would agree well with the later location of the Jutes in Kent, since the area just opposite to Kent on the European mainland (present-day Flanders) was part of Francia. Even if Jutes were present to the south of the Saxons in the Rhineland or near the Frisians, this does not contradict the possibility that they were migrants from Jutland.\n\nAnother theory, known as the \"Jutish hypothesis\" – a term accepted by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" – claims that the Jutes may be synonymous with the Geats of southern Sweden or their neighbours, the Gutes. The evidence adduced for this theory includes:\nBULLET::::- primary sources referring to the Geats (\"Geátas\") by alternative names such as \"Iútan\", \"Iótas\", and \"Eotas\"\nBULLET::::- Asser in his \"Life of Alfred\" (893) identifies the Jutes with the Goths (in a passage claiming that Alfred the Great was descended, through his mother, Osburga, from the ruling dynasty of the Jutish kingdom of Wihtwara, on the Isle of Wight)\nBULLET::::- the \"Gutasaga\" (13th century) states that some inhabitants of Gotland left for mainland Europe; large burial sites attributable to either Goths or Gepids were found in the 19th century near Willenberg, Prussia (after 1945 Wielbark in Poland).\nHowever, the tribal names possibly were confused in the above sources (an error that demonstrably occurred in sources discussing the death of the seventh-century Swedish king Östen, for example). In both \"Beowulf\" (8th – 11th centuries) and \"Widsith\" (late 7th - 10th century), the \"Eotenas\" (in the Finn passage) are clearly distinguished from the \"Geatas\".\n\nThe Germanic dialect that the Jutes spoke is unknown; currently, no information or credible source can be found on their language. However, Jutes likely had used a traditional Germanic form of the Runic alphabet. Most scholars agree that they spoke either a group of Proto-Norse languages or an Ingvaeonic language, but which dialect of Germanic language was spoken remains a matter of dispute.\n\nThe Jutes, along with some Angles, Saxons, and Frisians, sailed across the North Sea to raid and eventually invade Roman Britain, from the late fourth century onwards, either displacing, absorbing, or destroying Romanised British kingdoms in south-east Britain. According to Bede, the Jutes established four kingdoms:\nBULLET::::- \"Cantaware\" (Latinised as \"Cantuarii\"), in the Roman civitas of \"Cantiaca\" (Kent);\nBULLET::::- the kingdom of \"Wihtwara\" (Latin: \"Uictuarii\") on \"isla Vectum\" (the Isle of Wight) and;\nBULLET::::- two settlements in coastal parts of the previous kingdom of the Belgae, i.e. an area known later as Hampshire:\nBULLET::::- \"Meonwara\" (in the Meon Valley area), and\nBULLET::::- \"Ytene\" (which Florence of Worcester states was in the area that became the New Forest).\nSome evidence indicates that the Haestingas people who settled in the Hastings area of Sussex, in the 6th century, may also have been Jutish in origin.\n\nWhile detecting their influences in Kent (for example, the practice of partible inheritance known as gavelkind) is commonplace, the Jutes in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight vanished, probably assimilated to the surrounding Saxons, leaving only the slightest of traces. One recent scholar, Robin Bush, even argued that the Jutes of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were victims of a form of ethnic cleansing by the West Saxons. Bede clearly implies that this was so, in 686. However, Bush's theory has been the subject of debate amongst academics, including a counter-hypothesis that only the aristocracy were wiped out.\n\nThe culture of the Jutes of Kent shows more signs of Roman, Frankish, and Christian influence than that of the Angles or Saxons. Funerary evidence indicates that the pagan practice of cremation ceased relatively early and jewellery recovered from graves has affinities with Rhenish styles from the Continent, perhaps suggesting close commercial connections with Francia. The Quoit Brooch Style has been regarded as Jutish, from the fifth century.\n\nBULLET::::- Haestingas\n\nBULLET::::- Stenton, Frank M. (1971). \"Anglo-Saxon England\", 3rd ed.

{"id": "16161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16161", "title": "Jewish prayer", "text": "Jewish prayer\n\nJewish prayer (, ; plural ; , plural ; Yinglish: davening from Yiddish 'pray') are the prayer recitations and Jewish meditation traditions that form part of the observance of Rabbinic Judaism. These prayers, often with instructions and commentary, are found in the \"siddur\", the traditional Jewish prayer book. However, the term \"tefillah\" as referenced in the Talmud refers specifically to the Shemoneh Esreh.\n\nPrayer—as a \"service of the heart\"—is in principle a Torah-based commandment. It is not time-dependent and is mandatory for both Jewish men and women.\n\nHowever, in general, today, Jewish men are obligated to conduct \"tefillah\" (\"prayer\") three times a day within specific time ranges (zmanim), while, according to some posekim (\"Jewish legal authorities\"), women are only required to engage in \"tefillah\" once a day, others say at least twice a day.\n\nTraditionally, since the Second Temple period, three prayer services are recited daily:\nBULLET::::1. Morning prayer: \"Shacharit\" or \"Shaharit\" (), from the Hebrew \"shachar\" or \"shahar\" () \"morning light\",\nBULLET::::2. Afternoon prayer: \"Mincha\" or \"Minha\" (), the afternoon prayers named for the flour offering that accompanied sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem,\nBULLET::::3. Additional prayer: \"Arvit\" (, \"of the evening\") or \"Maariv\" (, \"bringing on night\"), from \"nightfall\".\nFurther additional prayers:\nBULLET::::- \"Musaf\" (, \"additional\") are recited by Orthodox and Conservative congregations on Shabbat, major Jewish holidays (including Chol HaMoed), and Rosh Chodesh.\nBULLET::::- A fifth prayer service, \"Ne'ila\" (, \"closing\"), is recited only on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.\n\nThe Talmud Bavli gives two reasons why there are three basic prayers \"de-rabbanan\" (\"from our Rabbis\") since the early Second Temple period on: to recall the daily sacrifices at the Temple in Jerusalem, and/or because each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the afternoon and Jacob the evening prayer. The Talmud yerushalmi states that the Anshei Knesset HaGedola (\"The Men of the Great Assembly\") learned and understood the beneficial concept of regular daily prayer from personal habits of the forefathers (\"avoth\", Avraham, Isaac, Yaacov) as hinted in the Tanach, and instituted the three daily prayers. A distinction is made between individual prayer and communal prayer, which requires a quorum known as a \"minyan\", with communal prayer being preferable as it permits the inclusion of prayers that otherwise would be omitted.\n\nMaimonides (1135–1204 CE) relates that until the Babylonian exile (586 BCE), all Jews had composed their own prayers, but thereafter the sages of the Great Assembly in the early Second Temple period composed the main portions of the \"siddur\". Modern scholarship dating from the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement of 19th-century Germany, as well as textual analysis influenced by the 20th-century discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, suggests that dating from this period there existed \"liturgical formulations of a communal nature designated for particular occasions and conducted in a centre totally independent of Jerusalem and the Temple, making use of terminology and theological concepts that were later to become dominant in Jewish and, in some cases, Christian prayer.\" The language of the prayers, while clearly from the Second Temple period (516 BCE – 70 CE), often employs Biblical idiom. Jewish prayerbooks emerged during the early Middle Ages during the period of the Geonim of Babylonia (6th–11th centuries CE)\n\nOver the last two thousand years traditional variations have emerged among the traditional liturgical customs of different Jewish communities, such as Ashkenazic, Sephardic, Yemenite, Eretz Yisrael and others, or rather recent liturgical inventions such as Hassidic, Chabad, Conservative, and various Reform minhagim. However the differences are minor compared with the commonalities. Halachically, Jews can switch from one nusach tefillah to another (and back) at any time, even on a daily basis, and are not bound to follow the nusach of their forefathers. Most of the Jewish liturgy is sung or chanted with traditional melodies or trope. Synagogues may designate or employ a professional or lay \"hazzan\" (cantor) for the purpose of leading the congregation in prayer, especially on Shabbat or holidays.\n\nAccording to the Talmud Bavli (tractate Taanit 2a), \"tefillah\" (\"prayer\") is a Biblical command: \"'You shall serve God with your whole heart.' () What service is performed with the heart? This is tefillah.\" Prayer is therefore referred to as \"Avodah sheba-Lev\" (\"service that is in the heart\"). It is not time-dependent and is mandatory for both Jewish men and women. Mentioning \"tefillah\", the Talmud always refers to the \"Amidah\", that is also called \"Shemoneh Esreh\". The noted rabbi Maimonides (RaMBaM) likewise categorizes \"tefillah\" as a Biblical command of Written law, as the Babylon Talmud says. However, corresponding with the Jerusalem Talmud, the RaMBaM did hold that the number of \"tefillot\" (\"prayers\") and their times are not a Biblical command of Written law and that the forefathers did not institute such a Takkanah, rather it was a rabbinical command \"de-rabbanan\" (\"from our Rabbis\") based on a takkanah of the Anshei Knesset HaGedola (\"The Men of the Great Assembly\").\n\nThe Oral law, according to the Talmud Bavli (tractate Berachoth 26b) gives two reasons why there are three basic prayers:\nBULLET::::1. According to Rabbi Jose b. Hanina, each of the Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the afternoon and Jacob the evening prayers. This view is supported with Biblical quotes indicating that the Patriarchs prayed at the times mentioned. However, even according to this view, the exact times of when the services are held, and moreover the entire concept of a \"mussaf\" service, are still based on the sacrifices.\nBULLET::::2. Each service was instituted parallel to a sacrificial act in the Temple in Jerusalem: the morning \"Tamid\" offering, the afternoon \"Tamid\" offering, and the overnight burning of this last offering.\n\nThe Oral Torah, according to the Talmud yerushalmi (tractate Berachoth 4) states why there are three basic \"tefillot\" (\"prayers\") and who instituted them:\nBULLET::::- Rabbi Yehoshua said that the Anshei Knesset HaGedola (\"The Men of the Great Assembly\") learned and understood the beneficial concept of regular daily tefillot from the habit of the forefathers (\"avoth\") Avraham, Isaac and Yaakov. Therefore, the Anshei Knesset HaGedola based their Takkanah that Jewish men were required to pray three times a day from hints to personal habits of the forefathers in the tanach.\n\nAdditional references in the Hebrew Bible have been interpreted to suggest that King David and the prophet Daniel prayed three times a day. In Psalms, David states:\n\nAs in the Book of Daniel:\nOrthodox, Modern Orthodox and Sefardic strands of Judaism regard \"halakha\" (the collective body of religious laws for Jews) as requiring Jewish men to say \"tefillot\" (\"prayers\") three times daily and four times daily on the Sabbath and most Jewish holidays, and five times on Yom Kippur. Some of those movements regard the system of multiple daily prayer services within specific time frames as optional for women due to their need to be constantly taking care of small children, but—in accordance with halakha—they are still required to pray at least daily, without a specific time requirement. Moreover, it is generally accepted by Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, and Sephardic religious authorities that women are exempt from the evening prayer. Conservative Judaism regards the \"halakhic\" system of multiple daily services as mandatory. Since 2002, Jewish women from Conservative congregations have been regarded as having undertaken a communal obligation to pray the same prayers at the same times as men, with traditional communities and individual women permitted to opt out. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations do not regard \"halakha\" as binding and hence regard appropriate prayer times as matters of personal spiritual decision rather than a matter of religious requirement.\n\nAccording to halakha, all individual prayers and virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the \"Mishnah\" mentions that the \"Shema\" need not be said in Hebrew A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the others are prayers that are to be said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a priest, or by a reigning King.\n\nDespite this, the tradition of most Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogues is to use Hebrew (usually Ashkenazi Hebrew) for all except a small number of prayers, including the Aramaic \"Kaddish\" (\"holy\"), and the notable Gott Fun Avraham, which was written in Yiddish. In other streams of Judaism there is considerable variability: Sephardic communities may use Ladino or Portuguese for many prayers; Conservative synagogues tend to use the local language to a varying degree; and at some Reform synagogues almost the whole service may be in the local language.\n\nMaimonides (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 1:4) relates that until the Babylonian exile, all Jews composed their own prayers. After the exile, however, the sages of the time (united in the Great Assembly) found the ability of the people insufficient to continue the practice, and they legendarily composed the main portions of the \"siddur\", such as the \"Amidah\", from which no fragments survived. The origins of modern Jewish prayer were established during the period of the Tannaim, \"from their traditions, later committed to writing, we learn that the generation of rabbis active at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple (70 CE) gave Jewish prayer its structure and, in outline form at least, its contents.\" This liturgy included the twice-daily recitation of the Shema, the Amidah, or Shmoneh Esrei, including 18 blessings recited several times daily, and the public recitation of the Torah in installments. The oldest prayer books date from the time of the Geonim of Babylonia; \"some were composed by respected rabbinic scholars at the request of far-flung communities seeking an authoritative text of the required prayers for daily use, Shabbat, and holidays.\"\n\nThe language of the prayers, while clearly being from the Second Temple period, often employs Biblical idiom, and according to some authorities it should not contain rabbinic or Mishnaic idiom apart from in the sections of Mishnah that are featured (see Baer).\n\nOver the last two thousand years, the various branches of Judaism have resulted in small variations in the Rabbinic liturgy customs among different Jewish communities, with each community having a slightly different Nusach (customary liturgy). The principal difference is between Ashkenazic and Sephardic customs, although there are other communities (e.g., Yemenite Jews, Eretz Yisrael), and rather recent liturgical inventions such as Hassidic, Chabad, Reform and other communities also have distinct customs, variations, and special prayers. The differences are quite minor compared with the commonalities. The idea that a Jew should not change his \"Nusach Tefillah\" and has to continue to pray in the way of his forefathers is an invented Halacha of the galut (\"diaspora\", \"scattering, dispersion\"). According to halakha, a Jew may change his \"nusach tefilla\" at any time, even on a daily basis.\n\nThe earliest parts of Jewish prayer are the \"Shema Yisrael\" (\"Hear O Israel\") (Deuteronomy 6:4 \"et seq\"), and the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24–26), which are in the Torah. A set of eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the \"Shemoneh Esreh\" or the \"Amidah\" (Hebrew, \"standing [prayer]\"), is traditionally ascribed to the Great Assembly in the time of Ezra, at the end of the Biblical period.\n\nThe name \"Shemoneh Esreh\", literally \"eighteen\", is an historical anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the Second Temple period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. It was not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the Middle Ages the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today.\n\nThe siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy as early as 1486, though a siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The siddur began appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first English translation, by Gamaliel ben Pedahzur (a pseudonym), appeared in London in 1738; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.\n\nReadings from the Torah (five books of Moses) and the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") form part of the prayer services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns.\n\nThe earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Rav Amram Gaon of Sura, Babylon, about 850 CE. Half a century later Rav Saadia Gaon, also of Sura, composed a siddur, in which the rubrical matter is in Arabic. These were the basis of Simcha ben Samuel's Machzor Vitry (11th-century France), which was based on the ideas of his teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by Maimonides to the laws of prayer in his Mishneh Torah: this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this point forward, all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents.\n\nConservative services generally use the same basic format for services as in Orthodox Judaism, with some doctrinal leniencies and some prayers in English. In practice, there is wide variation among Conservative congregations. In traditionalist congregations the liturgy can be almost identical to that of Orthodox Judaism, almost entirely in Hebrew (and Aramaic), with a few minor exceptions, including excision of a study session on Temple sacrifices, and modifications of prayers for the restoration of the sacrificial system. In more liberal Conservative synagogues there are greater changes to the service, with up to a third of the service in English; abbreviation or omission of many of the preparatory prayers; and replacement of some traditional prayers with more contemporary forms. There are some changes for doctrinal reasons, including egalitarian language, fewer references to restoring sacrifices in the Temple in Jerusalem, and an option to eliminate special roles for Kohanim and Levites.\n\nThe liturgies of Reform and Reconstructionist are based on traditional elements, but contains language more reflective of liberal belief than the traditional liturgy. Doctrinal revisions generally include revising or omitting references to traditional doctrines such as bodily resurrection, a personal Jewish Messiah, and other elements of traditional Jewish eschatology, Divine revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai, angels, conceptions of reward and punishment, and other personal miraculous and supernatural elements. Services are often from 40% to 90% in the vernacular.\n\nReform Judaism has made greater alterations to the traditional service in accord with its more liberal theology including dropping references to traditional elements of Jewish eschatology such as a personal Messiah, a bodily resurrection of the dead, and others. The Hebrew portion of the service is substantially abbreviated and modernized and modern prayers substituted for traditional ones. In addition, in keeping with their view that the laws of Shabbat (including a traditional prohibition on playing instruments) are inapplicable to modern circumstances, Reform services often play instrumental or recorded music with prayers on the Jewish Sabbath. All Reform synagogues are Egalitarian with respect to gender roles.\n\nIn Jewish philosophy and in Rabbinic literature, it is noted that the Hebrew verb for prayer—\"hitpallel\" התפלל—is in fact the reflexive form of \"palal\" פלל, to judge. Thus, \"to pray\" conveys the notion of \"judging oneself\": ultimately, the purpose of prayer—\"tefilah\" תפלה—is to transform ourselves.\n\nThis etymology is consistent with the Jewish conception of divine simplicity. It is not God that changes through our prayer—Man does not influence God as a defendant influences a human judge who has emotions and is subject to change—rather it is man himself who is changed. It is further consistent with Maimonides' view on Divine Providence. Here, Tefillah is the medium which God gave to man by means of which he can change himself, and thereby establish a new \"relationship\" with God—and thus a new destiny for himself in life; see also under Psalms.\n\nIn this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists.\n\nIn this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p. XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).\n\nKabbalah (esoteric Jewish mysticism) uses a series of kavanot, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialogue with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalism ascribes a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.\n\nThis approach has been taken by the Chassidei Ashkenaz (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the Zohar, the Arizal's Kabbalist tradition, the Ramchal, most of Hassidism, the Vilna Gaon and Jacob Emden.\n\nHassidism, although incorporating the kabbalistic worldview and its corresponding kavanot, also emphasized straightforward sincerity and depth of emotional engagement in prayer. The Baal Shem Tov's great-grandson, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, particularly emphasized speaking to God in one's own words, which he called Hitbodedut (self-seclusion) and advised setting aside an hour to do this every day (Likutei Moharan 2:25).\n\n\"Daven\" is the originally exclusively Eastern Yiddish verb meaning \"pray\"; it is widely used by Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews. In Yinglish, this has become the Anglicised \"davening\".\n\nThe origin of the word is obscure, but is thought by some to have come from Arabic (from \"diwan\", a collection of poems or prayers), French (from \"devoner\", 'to devote' or 'dedicate' or possibly from the French 'devant'- 'in front of' with the idea that the person praying is mindful of before whom they stand), Latin (from \"divin\", 'divine') or even English (from \"dawn\"). Others believe that it derives from a Slavic word meaning \"to give\" (). Some claim that it originates from an Aramaic word, \"de'avuhon\" or \"d'avinun\", meaning 'of their/our forefathers', as the three prayers are said to have been invented by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Another Aramaic derivation, proposed by Avigdor Chaikin, cites the Talmudic phrase, \"\"ka davai lamizrach\"\", 'gazing wistfully to the east' (Shab. 35a). Kevin A. Brook, cites Zeiden's suggestion that the word \"daven\" comes from the Turkish root \"tabun-\" meaning 'to pray', and that in Kipchak Turkish, the initial \"t\" morphs into \"d\".\n\nIn Western Yiddish, the term for \"pray\" is \"oren\", a word with clear roots in Romance languages—compare Spanish and Portuguese \"orar\" and Latin \"orare\".\n\nIndividual prayer is considered acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten Jewish adults—a \"minyan\"—is the most highly recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means over the age of 12 or 13 (\"bat\" or \"bar mitzvah\"). Judaism had originally counted only men in the \"minyan\" for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all time-specific positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. \n\nSince 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the \"minyan\". A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a \"minyan\" mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a \"minyan\". All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. \n\nThere is a publicly said prayer, called Birkhat HaGomel, for giving thanks for surviving an illness or danger. which, in addition to needing a \"Minyan\", also needs a Torah scroll taken out for a scheduled Torah reading.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Head covering\". In most synagogues, it is considered a sign of respect for male attendees to wear a head covering, either a dress hat or a kippa (skull cap, plural \"kipot\" also known by the Yiddish term \"yarmulke\"). It is common practice for both Jews and non-Jews who attend a synagogue to wear a head covering. Some Conservative synagogues may also encourage (but rarely require) women to cover their heads. Many Reform and Progressive temples do not require people to cover their heads, although individual worshipers, both men and women, may choose to. Many Orthodox and some conservative men and women wear a head covering throughout their day, even when not attending religious services.\nBULLET::::- \"Tallit\" (prayer shawl) is traditionally worn during all morning services, during Aliyah to the Torah, as well as during all the services of Yom Kippur. During the daily afternoon and evening services, the \"hazzan\" alone wears a tallit. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men who are halakhically Jewish and though in some Conservative synagogues they should be worn only by men, in other Conservative synagogues both men and women who are halakhically Jewish should wear a tallit. In most Orthodox Ashkenazi synagogues they are worn only by men who are or have been married.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Tefillin\" (phylacteries) are a set of small cubic leather boxes painted black, containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. They are tied to the head and arm with leather straps dyed black, and worn by Jews only, during weekday morning prayers. In Orthodox synagogues they are expected to be worn only by men; in Conservative synagogues they are also worn by some women. The Karaite Jews, however, do not don tefillin.\nBULLET::::- \"Tzeniut\" (modesty) applies to men and women. When attending Orthodox synagogues, women will likely be expected to wear long sleeves (past the elbows), long skirts (past the knees), a high neckline (to the collar bone), and if married, to cover their hair with a wig, scarf, hat or a combination of the above. For men, short pants or sleeveless shirts are generally regarded as inappropriate. In some Conservative and Reform synagogues the dress code may be more lax, but still respectful.\n\nThe \"Shacharit\" (from \"shachar\", morning light) prayer is recited in the morning. \"Halacha\" limits parts of its recitation to the first three (Shema) or four (Amidah) hours of the day, where \"hours\" are 1/12 of daylight time, making these times dependent on the season.\n\nVarious prayers are said upon arising; the tallit katan (a garment with tzitzit) is donned at this time. The tallit (large prayer shawl) is donned before or during the actual prayer service, as are the tefillin (phylacteries); both are accompanied by blessings.\n\nThe service starts with the \"morning blessings\" (\"birkot ha-shachar\"), including blessings for the Torah (considered the most important ones). In Orthodox services this is followed by a series of readings from Biblical and rabbinic writings recalling the offerings made in the Temple in Jerusalem. The section concludes with the \"Rabbis' Kaddish\" (\"kaddish de-rabbanan\").\n\nThe next section of morning prayers is called \"Pesukei D'Zimrah\" (\"verses of praise\"), containing several psalms (100 and 145–150), and prayers (such as \"yehi chevod\") made from a tapestry of Biblical verses, followed by the Song at the Sea (Exodus, chapters and ).\n\n\"Barechu\", the formal public call to prayer, introduces a series of expanded blessings embracing the recitation of the \"Shema\". This is followed by the core of the prayer service, the \"Amidah\" or \"Shemoneh Esreh\", a series of 19 blessings. The next part of the service, is \"Tachanun\", supplications, which is omitted on days with a festive character (and by Reform services usually entirely).\n\nOn Mondays and Thursdays a Torah reading service is inserted, and a longer version of Tachanun takes place.\n\nConcluding prayers (see Uva letzion) and Aleinu then follow, with the Kaddish of the mourners generally after Aleinu.\n\n\"Mincha\" or \"Minha\" (derived from the flour offering that accompanied each sacrifice) may be recited from half an hour after \"halachic\" noontime. This earliest time is referred to as \"mincha gedola\" (the \"large mincha\"). There is, however, another time to daven mincha, which is then known as \"mincha ketana\" (2.5 \"halachic\" hours before nightfall). Ideally, one should complete the prayers before sunset, although many authorities permit reciting Mincha until nightfall. Mincha is allowed to be recited during any of the hours between mincha gedola and mincha ketana also.\n\nSephardim and Italian Jews start the Mincha prayers with Psalm 84 and \"Korbanot\" (), and usually continue with the \"Pittum hakketoret\". The opening section is concluded with . Western Ashkenazim recite the \"Korbanot\" only.\n\n\"Ashrei\", containing verses from Psalms , and the entire , is recited, immediately followed by \"Chatzi Kaddish\" (half-Kaddish) and the \"Shemoneh Esreh\" (or Amidah). This is followed by \"Tachanun\", supplications, and then the full Kaddish. Sephardim insert Psalm or , followed by the Mourner's Kaddish. After this follows, in most modern rites, the \"Aleinu\". Ashkenazim then conclude with the Mourner's Kaddish. Service leaders often wear a tallit even on normal days, and must wear one during the fast days.\n\nIn many congregations, the afternoon and evening prayers are recited back-to-back on a working day, to save people having to attend synagogue twice. The Vilna Gaon discouraged this practice, and followers of his set of customs commonly wait until after nightfall to recite \"Ma'ariv\" (the name derives from the word \"nightfall\").\n\nThis service begins with the \"Barechu\", the formal public call to prayer, and \"Shema Yisrael\" embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and followers of the Vilna Gaon) then add another blessing (\"Baruch Adonai le-Olam\"), which is made from a tapestry of biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim in and out of Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the \"Shemoneh Esreh\" (\"Amidah\"), bracketed with the full Kaddish. Sephardim then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat \"Barechu\" before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with \"Aleinu\" followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).\n\nOn Shabbat (the Sabbath), prayers are similar in structure to those on weekdays, although almost every part is lengthened. One exception in the \"Amidah\", the main prayer, which is \"abridged\". The first three and last three blessings are recited as usual, but the middle thirteen are replaced with a single blessing known as \"\"sanctity of the day,\"\" describing the Sabbath. Atypically, this middle blessing is different for each of the prayers.\n\nShabbat services begin on Friday evening with the weekday Mincha (see above), followed in some communities by the Song of Songs, and then in most communities by the \"Kabbalat Shabbat\", the mystical prelude to Shabbat services composed by 16th-century Kabbalists. This Hebrew term literally means \"Receiving the Sabbath\". In many communities, the piyut \"Yedid Nefesh\" introduces the Kabbalat Shabbat prayers.\n\nKabbalat Shabbat is, except amongst many Italian and Spanish and Portuguese Jews, composed of six psalms, to , and , representing the six week-days. Next comes the poem \"Lekha Dodi\". Composed by Rabbi Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz in the mid-16th century, it is based on the words of the Talmudic sage Hanina: \"Come, let us go out to meet the Queen Sabbath\" (Talmud Shabbat 119a). Kabbalat Shabbat is concluded by (the recital of which constitutes men's acceptance of the current Shabbat with all its obligations) and . Many add a study section here, including \"Bameh Madlikin\" and \"Amar rabbi El'azar\" and the concluding \"Kaddish deRabbanan\" and is then followed by the Maariv service; other communities delay the study session until after Maariv. Still other customs add here a passage from the Zohar. In modern times the Kabbalat Shabbat has been set to music by many composers including: Robert Strassburg\nand Samuel Adler\n\nThe Shema section of the Friday night service varies in some details from the weekday services—mainly in the different ending of the \"Hashkivenu\" prayer and the omission of \"Baruch Adonai le-Olam\" prayer in those traditions where this section is otherwise recited. In the Italian rite, there are also different versions of the \"Ma'ariv 'aravim\" prayer (beginning \"asher killah\" on Friday nights) and the \"Ahavat 'olam\" prayer.\n\nMost commemorate the Shabbat at this point with \"VeShameru\" (). The custom to recite the biblical passage at this point has its origins in the Lurianic Kabbalah, and does not appear before the 16th century. It is therefore absent in traditions and prayer books less influenced by the Kabbalah (such as the Yemenite \"Baladi\" tradition), or those that opposed adding additional readings to the siddur based upon the Kabbalah (such as the Vilna Gaon).\n\nThe middle blessing of the \"Amidah\" (see above) discusses the conclusion of the Creation, quoting the relevant verses from Genesis. This is then followed by the hazzan's mini-repetition of the Amidah, \"Magen Avot\", a digest of the seven benedictions (hence its Hebrew name \"Achat Me'ein Sheva\"). In some Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogues the second chapter of Mishnah tractate Shabbat, \"Bameh Madlikin\", is read at this point, instead of earlier. Kiddush is recited in the synagogue in Ashkenazi and a few Sephardi communities. The service then follows with Aleinu. Most Sephardi and many Ashkenazi synagogues end with the singing of \"Yigdal\", a poetic adaptation of Maimonides' 13 principles of Jewish faith. Other Ashkenazi synagogues end with \"Adon `olam\" instead.\n\nShabbat morning prayers commence as on week-days. Of the hymns, Psalm 100 (\"Mizmor LeTodah\", the psalm for the Thanksgiving offering), is omitted because the \"todah\" or Thanksgiving offering could not be offered on Shabbat in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. Its place is taken in the Ashkenazi tradition by Psalms , , , , , , , , . Sephardic Jews maintain a different order, add several psalms and two religious poems. The \"Nishmat\" prayer is recited at the end of the \"Pesukei D'Zimrah\". The blessings before \"Shema\" are expanded, and include the hymn \"El Adon\", which is often sung communally.\n\nThe intermediary benediction of the \"Shacharit Amidah\" begins with \"Yismach Moshe\" and discusses Moses' receiving of the Torah (which according to tradition took place on the morning of the Sabbath). Kedushah, which is always recited during the Hazzan's repetition of the third blessing, is significantly expanded. After the repetition is concluded, the Torah scroll is taken out of the Ark in a ritual much longer than the ritual during the week, and the weekly portion is read, followed by the \"haftarah\".\n\nAfter the Torah reading, three prayers for the community are recited. Two prayers starting with \"Yekum Purkan\", composed in Babylon in Aramaic, are similar to the subsequent \"Mi sheberakh\", a blessing for the leaders and patrons of the synagogue. The Sephardim omit much of the Yekum Purkan. Prayers are then recited (in some communities) for the government of the country, for peace, and for the State of Israel.\n\nAfter these prayers, Ashrei is repeated and the Torah scroll is returned to the Ark in a procession through the Synagogue. Many congregations allow children to come to the front in order to kiss the scroll as it passes. In many Orthodox communities, the Rabbi (or a learned member of the congregation) delivers a sermon at this point, usually on the topic of the Torah reading.\n\nThe \"Musaf\" service starts with the silent recitation of the \"Amidah\". The middle blessing includes the \"Tikanta Shabbat\" reading on the holiness of Shabbat, and then by a reading from the biblical Book of Numbers about the sacrifices that used to be performed in the Temple in Jerusalem. Next comes \"Yismechu\", \"They shall rejoice in Your sovereignty\", and \"Eloheynu\", \"Our God and God of our Ancestors, may you be pleased with our rest\" (which is recited during all \"Amidah\"s of the Sabbath. Kedushah is greatly expanded.\n\nAfter the \"Amidah\" comes the full Kaddish, followed by \"Ein keloheinu\". In Orthodox Judaism this is followed by a reading from the Talmud on the incense offering called Pittum Haketoreth and daily psalms that used to be recited in the Temple in Jerusalem. These readings are usually omitted by Conservative Jews, and are always omitted by Reform Jews.\n\nThe \"Musaf\" service culminates with the Rabbi's Kaddish, the \"Aleinu\", and then the Mourner's Kaddish. Some synagogues conclude with the reading of \"An'im Zemirot\", \"The Hymn of Glory\", Mourner's Kaddish, the Psalm of the Day and either Adon Olam or Yigdal.\n\nMincha commences with \"Ashrei\" (see above) and the prayer Uva letzion, after which the first section of the next weekly portion is read from the Torah scroll. The \"Amidah\" follows the same pattern as the other Shabbat \"Amidah\" prayers, with the middle blessing starting \"Attah Echad\".\n\nThe week-day Ma'ariv is recited on the evening immediately following Shabbat, concluding with \"Vihi No'am\", \"Ve-Yitten lekha\", and \"Havdalah\".\n\nThe services for the Days of Awe—Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur—take on a solemn tone as befits these days. Traditional solemn tunes are used in the prayers.\n\nThe musaf service on Rosh Hashana has nine blessings; the three middle blessings include biblical verses attesting to sovereignty, remembrance and the shofar, which is sounded 100 times during the service.\n\nYom Kippur is the only day in the year when there are five prayer services. The evening service, containing the Ma'ariv prayer, is widely known as \"Kol Nidrei\", the opening declaration made preceding the prayer. During the daytime, shacharit, musaf (which is recited on Shabbat and all festivals) and mincha are followed, as the sun begins to set, by Ne'ila, which is recited just this once a year.\n\nThe services for the three festivals of Pesach (\"Passover\"), Shavuot (\"Feast of Weeks\" or \"Pentecost\"), and Sukkot (\"Feast of Tabernacles\") are alike, except for interpolated references and readings for each individual festival. The preliminaries and conclusions of the prayers are the same as on Shabbat. The Amidah on these festivals only contains seven benedictions, with \"Attah Bechartanu\" as the main one. Hallel (communal recitation of Psalms -) follows.\n\nThe Musaf service includes Umi-Penei Hata'enu, with reference to the special festival and Temple sacrifices on the occasion. A blessing on the pulpit (\"dukhen\") is pronounced by the \"kohanim\" (Jewish priests) during the Amidah. While this occurs daily in Israel and most Sephardic congregations, it occurs only on Pesach, Shavuot, Sukkot, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur in Ashkenazic congregations of the diaspora. (Those Ashkenazic congregations substitute a prayer recited by the hazzan after the Modim (\"Thanksgiving\") prayer) on week-days and Sabbath in commemoration of the priestly blessing.) (American Reform Jews omit the Musaf service.)\n\nIn the event one of the prayers was missed inadvertently, the Amidah prayer is said twice in the next service—a procedure known as \"tefillat tashlumin\".\n\nMany Jews sway their body back and forth during prayer. This practice (referred to as \"shoklen\" in Yiddish) is not mandatory, and in fact the kabbalist Isaac Luria felt that it should not be done. In contrast, the German Medieval authority \"Maharil\" (Rabbi Jacob Molin) linked the practice to a statement in the Talmud that the Mishnaic sage Rabbi Akiva would sway so forcefully that he ended up at the other side of the room when praying (Talmud tractate Berachot).\n\nMany are accustomed to giving charity before, during (especially during Vayivarech David) or after prayer, in the hopes that this will make their prayer more likely to be heard.\n\nMen are obligated to perform public prayer three times a day with additional services on Jewish holidays. According to Jewish law, each prayer must be performed within specific time ranges (zmanim), based on the time that the communal sacrifice the prayer is named after would have been performed in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to the Talmud women are generally exempted from obligations that have to be performed at a certain time. Orthodox authorities have generally interpreted this exemption due to women's higher spiritual level and therefore a lack of need to connect to God at specific times, since they are always connected to God. In accordance with the general exemption from time-bound obligations, most Orthodox authorities have exempted women from performing evening prayers (Maariv), but most believe that women are obligated to pray Shacharit and Mincha, the morning and afternoon prayers, respectively, when possible. According to the Mishna, women are exempt from the morning and evening Shema.\n\nOrthodox authorities have been careful to note that although some women with small children have been exempted from praying at specific fixed times, they are not exempted from the obligation of prayer itself. The 19th-century posek Yechiel Michel Epstein, author of the \"Arukh HaShulkhan\", notes: \"Even though the rabbis set prayer at fixed times in fixed language, it was not their intention to issue a leniency and exempt women from this ritual act\". Traditionally women were also reciting individual tkhine prayers in Yiddish.\n\nAuthorities have disagreed on the minimum amount that women's prayer should contain. Many Jewish women have relied on an idea expressed by(Ashkenazi) Rabbi Avraham Gombiner in his \"Magen Avraham\" commentary on the \"Shulkhan Arukh\", and more recently the (Sephardi) Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (\"Yabiah Omer\" vol. 6, 17), that women are only required to pray once a day, in any form they choose, so long as the prayer contains praise of (brakhot), requests to (bakashot), and thanks of (hodot) God. However, most Orthodox authorities agree that women are not completely exempt from time-bound prayer. The \"Mishnah Berurah\" by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, an important code of Ashkenzic Jewish law, holds that the Men of the Great Assembly obligated women to say \"Shacharit\" (morning) and \"Minchah\" (afternoon) prayer services each day, \"just like men\". The \"Mishnah Berurah\" also states that although women are exempt from reciting the Shema Yisrael, they should nevertheless say it anyway. Nonetheless, even the most liberal Orthodox authorities hold that women cannot count in a minyan for purposes of public prayer.\n\nThroughout Orthodox Judaism, including its most liberal forms, men and women are required to sit in separate sections with a mechitza (partition) separating them. Historically, a learned woman in the \"weibershul\" (women's section or annex) of a synagogue took on the informal role of precentress or firzogerin for the women praying in parallel to the main service led in the men's section. Conservative/Masorti Judaism permits mixed seating (almost universally in the United States, but not in all countries). All Reform and Reconstructionist congregations have mixed seating.\n\nHaredi and the vast majority of Modern Orthodox Judaism has a blanket prohibition on women leading public congregational prayers. Conservative Judaism has developed a blanket justification for women leading all or virtually all such prayers, holding that although only obligated individuals can lead prayers and women were not traditionally obligated, Conservative Jewish women in modern times have as a collective whole voluntarily undertaken such an obligation. Reform and Reconstructionist congregations permit women to perform all prayer roles because they do not regard halakha as binding.\n\nA small liberal wing within Modern Orthodox Judaism, particularly rabbis friendly to the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA), has begun re-examining the role of women in prayers based on an individual, case-by-case look at the historical role of specific prayers and services, doing so within classical \"halakhic\" interpretation. Accepting that where obligation exists only the obligated can lead, this small group has typically made three general arguments for expanded women's roles:\n\nBULLET::::1. Because women were required to perform certain korbanot (sacrifices) in the Temple in Jerusalem, women today are required to perform, and hence can lead (and can count in the \"minyan\" for if required), the specific prayers substituting for these specific sacrifices. \"Birchat Hagomel\" falls in this category.\nBULLET::::2. Because certain parts of the service were added after the Talmud defined mandatory services, such prayers are equally voluntary on everyone and hence can be led by women (and no \"minyan\" is required). \"Pseukei D'Zimrah\" in the morning and \"Kabbalat Shabbat\" on Friday nights fall in this category.\nBULLET::::3. In cases where the Talmud indicates that women are generally qualified to lead certain services but do not do so because of the \"dignity of the congregation\", modern congregations are permitted to waive such dignity if they wish. Torah reading on Shabbat falls in this category. An argument that women are permitted to lead the services removing and replacing the Torah in the Ark on \"Shabbat\" extends from their ability to participate in Torah reading then.\n\nA very small number of Modern Orthodox congregations accept some such arguments, but very few Orthodox congregations or authorities accept all or even most of them. Many of those who do not accept this reasoning point to \"kol isha\", the tradition that prohibits a man from hearing a woman other than his wife or close blood relative sing. JOFA refers to congregations generally accepting such arguments as Partnership Minyanim. On Shabbat in a Partnership Minyan, women can typically lead \"Kabbalat Shabbat\", the \"P'seukei D'Zimrah\", the services for removing the Torah from and replacing it to the Ark, and Torah reading, as well as give a \"D'Var Torah\" or sermon.\n\nThe first Orthodox Jewish women's prayer group was created on the holiday of Simhat Torah at Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan in the late 1960s.\n\nEphraim Mirvis, an Orthodox rabbi who serves as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, supports Shabbat prayer groups for Orthodox women, saying, \"Some of our congregations have women prayer groups for Friday night, some Saturday mornings. This is without women reading from the Torah. But for women to come together as a group to pray, this is a good thing.\"\n\nIn most divisions of Judaism boys prior to Bar Mitzvah cannot act as a Chazzen for prayer services that contain \"devarim sheb'kidusha\", i.e. Kaddish, Barechu, the amida, etc., or receive an aliya or chant the Torah for the congregation. Since Kabbalat Shabbat is just psalms and does not contain \"devarim sheb'kidusha\", it is possible for a boy under Bar Mitzvah to lead until Barechu of Ma'ariv. As well, the conclusion of the service on Shabbat and Chagim may be led by children. Under the Moroccan, Yemenite, and Mizrachi customs, a boy under bar mitzvah may lead certain prayers, read the Torah, and have an aliyah. It is customary among many Ashkenazim to have children sing \"Adon 'Olam\" after Mussaf and \"Yigdal\" after Shabat and Holiday Maariv. Among Sefardim, Mizrachim, Yemenites, and some Askenazim, a child leads the congregation in Kriyat Shema.\n\nBULLET::::- List of Jewish prayers and blessings\nBULLET::::- Baladi-rite prayer\nBULLET::::- Carlebach minyan\nBULLET::::- Hitbodedut\nBULLET::::- Siddur\nBULLET::::- Shuckling\n\nBULLET::::- Notes\nBULLET::::- Bibliography\nBULLET::::- \"To Pray As a Jew\", Hayim Halevy Donin, Basic Books ()\nBULLET::::- \"Entering Jewish Prayer\", Reuven Hammer ()\nBULLET::::- \"Kavvana: Directing the Heart in Jewish Prayer\", Seth Kadish, Jason Aronson Inc. 1997. .\nBULLET::::- \"Or Hadash: A Commentary on Siddur Sim Shalom for Shabbat and Festivals\", Reuven Hammer, The Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism\nBULLET::::- S.

{"id": "16162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16162", "title": "Jewish eschatology", "text": "Jewish eschatology\n\nJewish eschatology is the area of Jewish philosophy and theology concerned with events that will happen in the end of days and related concepts. This includes the ingathering of the exiled diaspora, the coming of a Jewish Messiah, afterlife, and the revival of the dead Tzadikim. In Judaism, the end times are usually called the \"end of days\" (\"aḥarit ha-yamim\", אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. \n\nUntil the late modern era, the standard Jewish belief was that after one dies, one's immortal soul joins God in the world to come while one's body decomposes, or the soul continues in a cycle of re-incarnation into a chain of other bodies. At the end of days, God will recompose one's body, place within it one's immortal soul, and that person will stand before God in judgement. The idea of a messianic age has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days. Jewish philosophers from medieval times to the present day have emphasized the soul's immortality.\n\nIn Judaism, the main textual source for the belief in the end of days and accompanying events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. The roots of Jewish eschatology are to be found in the pre-exile Prophets, including Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the exile-prophets Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah. The main tenets of Jewish eschatology are the following, in no particular order, elaborated in the Books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel:\nBULLET::::- End of world (before everything as follows)\nBULLET::::- God redeems the Jewish people from the captivity that began during the Babylonian Exile, in a new Exodus\nBULLET::::- God returns the Jewish people to the Land of Israel\nBULLET::::- God restores the House of David and the Temple in Jerusalem\nBULLET::::- God creates a regent from the House of David (i.e. the Jewish Messiah) to lead the Jewish people and the world and usher in an age of justice and peace\nBULLET::::- All nations recognize that the God of Israel is the only true God\nBULLET::::- God resurrects the dead\nBULLET::::- God creates a new heaven and a new earth\n\nThe Hebrew word \"mashiach\" (or \"moshiach\") refers to the Jewish idea of the messiah. Mashiach means \"anointed\", a meaning preserved in the English word derived from it, \"messiah\". The Messiah is to be a human leader, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule and unite the people of Israel and will usher in the Messianic Age of global and universal peace. While the name of the Jewish Messiah is considered to be one of the things that precede creation, he is not considered divine, in contrast to Christianity where Jesus is both divine and the Messiah.\n\nIn biblical times the title \"mashiach\" was awarded to someone in a high position of nobility and greatness. For example, Cohen ha-Mašíaḥ means High Priest. In the Talmudic era the title \"mashiach\" or מלך המשיח, Méleḫ ha-Mašíaḥ (in the Tiberian vocalization is pronounced Méleḵ haMMāšîªḥ) literally means \"the anointed King\". It is a reference to the Jewish leader and king that will redeem Israel in the end of days and usher in a messianic era of peace and prosperity for both the living and deceased.\n\nEarly in the Second temple Period hopes for a better future are described in the Jewish scriptures. After the return from the Babylonic exile, the Persian king Cyrus II was called \"messiah\" in Isiaiah, due to his role in the return of the Jews exiles.\n\nA number of messianic ideas developed during the later Second Temple Period, ranging from this-worldy, political expectations, to apocalyptic expectations of an endtime in which the dead would be resurrected and the Kingdom of Heaven would be established on earth. The Messiah might be a kingly \"Son of David,\" or a more heavenly \"Son of Man,\" but \"Messianism became increasingly eschatological, and eschatology was decisively influenced by apocalypticism,\" while \"messianic expectations became increasingly focused on the figure of an individual savior. According to Zwi Werblowsky, \"the Messiah no longer symbolized the coming of the new age, but he was somehow supposed to bring it about. The \"Lord's anointed\" thus became the \"savior and redeemer\" and the focus of more intense expectations and doctrines.\" Messianic ideas developed both by new interpretations (\"pesher\", \"midrash\") of the Jewish scriptures, but also by visionary revelations.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud (200-500 CE), tractate Sanhedrin, contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah. Throughout Jewish history Jews have compared these passages (and others) to contemporary events in search of signs of the Messiah's imminent arrival, continuing into present times.\n\nThe Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah, some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from Elijah the Prophet and the Messiah.\n\nIn rabbinic literature, the rabbis elaborated and explained the prophecies that were found in the Hebrew Bible along with the oral law and rabbinic traditions about its meaning.\n\nMaimonides' commentary to tractate Sanhedrin stresses a relatively naturalistic interpretation of the Messiah, de-emphasizing miraculous elements. His commentary became widely (although not universally) accepted in the non- or less-mystical branches of Orthodox Judaism.\n\nThe belief in a human Messiah of the Davidic line is a universal tenet of faith among Orthodox Jews and one of Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith.\n\nSome authorities in Orthodox Judaism believe that this era will lead to supernatural events culminating in a bodily resurrection of the dead. Maimonides, on the other hand, holds that the events of the messianic era are not specifically connected with the resurrection. (See the Maimonides article.)\n\nConservative Judaism varies in its teachings. While it retains traditional references to a personal redeemer and prayers for the restoration of the Davidic line in the liturgy, Conservative Jews are more inclined to accept the idea of a messianic era:\n\nReform Judaism generally concurs with the more liberal Conservative perspective of a future messianic era rather than a personal Messiah.\n\nAccording to Ezekiel chapter 38, the \"war of Gog and Magog\", a climactic war, will take place at the end of the Jewish exile. According to Radak, this war will take place in Jerusalem. However, a chassidic tradition holds that the war will not in fact occur, as the sufferings of exile have already made up for it.\n\nThe afterlife is known as \"olam ha-ba\" the \"world to come\", עולם הבא in Hebrew, and related to concepts of \"Gan Eden\", the Heavenly \"Garden in Eden\", or paradise, and \"Gehinom\". The phrase \"olam ha-ba\" does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. The accepted halakha is that it is impossible for living human beings to know what the world to come is like.\n\nIn the late Second Temple period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of the individual were diverse. The Essenes believed in the immortality of the soul, but the Pharisees and Sadducees, apparently, did not. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish Pseudepigrapha and Jewish magical papyri reflect this diversity.\n\nWhile all classic rabbinic sources discuss the afterlife, the classic Medieval scholars dispute the nature of existence in the \"End of Days\" after the messianic period. While Maimonides describes an entirely spiritual existence for souls, which he calls \"disembodied intellects,\" Nahmanides discusses an intensely spiritual existence on Earth, where spirituality and physicality are merged. Both agree that life after death is as Maimonides describes the \"End of Days.\" This existence entails an extremely heightened understanding of and connection to the Divine Presence. This view is shared by all classic rabbinic scholars.\n\nAccording to Maimonides, any non-Jew who lives according to the Seven Laws of Noah is regarded as a righteous gentile, and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.\n\nThere is much rabbinic material on what happens to the soul of the deceased after death, what it experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: \"Hibbut ha-kever\", the pains of the grave; \"Dumah\", the angel of silence; Satan as the angel of death; the \"Kaf ha-Kela\", the catapult of the soul; \"Gehinom\" (purgatory); and \"Gan Eden\" (heaven or paradise). All classic rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding. Therefore, these ideas are expressed throughout rabbinic literature through many varied parables and analogies.\n\n\"Gehinom\" is fairly well defined in rabbinic literature. It is sometimes translated as \"hell\", but is much more similar to the Nicene Christianity view of Purgatory than to the Christian view of Hell. Rabbinic thought maintains that souls are not tortured in gehinom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be eleven months, with the exception of heretics, and unobservant Jews. This is the reason that even when in mourning for near relatives, Jews will not recite mourner's kaddish for longer than an eleven-month period. \"Gehinom\" is considered a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to \"Gan Eden\" (\"Garden of Eden\").\n\nIn the 19th century book \"Legends of the Jews\", Louis Ginzberg compiled Jewish legends found in rabbinic literature. Among the legends are ones about the world to come and the two Gardens of Eden. The world to come is called Paradise, and it is said to have a double gate made of carbuncle that is guarded by 600,000 shining angels. Seven clouds of glory overshadow Paradise, and under them, in the center of Paradise, stands the tree of life. The tree of life overshadows Paradise too, and it has fifteen thousand different tastes and aromas that winds blow all across Paradise. Under the tree of life are many pairs of canopies, one of stars and the other of sun and moon, while a cloud of glory separates the two. In each pair of canopies sits a rabbinic scholar who explains the Torah to one. When one enters Paradise one is proffered by Michael (archangel) to God on the altar of the temple of the heavenly Jerusalem, whereupon one is transfigured into an angel (the ugliest person becomes as beautiful and shining as \"the grains of a silver pomegranate upon which fall the rays of the sun\"). The angels that guard Paradise's gate adorn one in seven clouds of glory, crown one with gems and pearls and gold, place eight myrtles in one's hand, and praise one for being righteous while leading one to a garden of eight hundred roses and myrtles that is watered by many rivers. In the garden is one's canopy, its beauty according to one's merit, but each canopy has four rivers - milk, honey, wine, and balsam - flowing out from it, and has a golden vine and thirty shining pearls hanging from it. Under each canopy is a table of gems and pearls attended to by sixty angels. The light of Paradise is the light of the righteous people therein. Each day in Paradise one wakes up a child and goes to bed an elder to enjoy the pleasures of childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age. In each corner of Paradise is a forest of 800,000 trees, the least among the trees greater than the best herbs and spices, attended to by 800,000 sweetly singing angels. Paradise is divided into seven paradises, each one 120,000 miles long and wide. Depending on one's merit, one joins one of the paradises: the first is made of glass and cedar and is for converts to Judaism; the second is of silver and cedar and is for penitents; the third is of silver and gold, gems and pearls, and is for the patriarchs, Moses and Aaron, the Israelites that left Egypt and lived in the wilderness, and the kings of Israel; the fourth is of rubies and olive wood and is for the holy and steadfast in faith; the fifth is like the third, except a river flows through it and its bed was woven by Eve and angels, and it is for the Messiah and Elijah; and the sixth and seventh divisions are not described, except that they are respectively for those who died doing a pious act and for those who died from an illness in expiation for Israel's sins. \n\nBeyond Paradise, according to Legends of the Jews, is the higher Gan Eden, where God is enthroned and explains the Torah to its inhabitants. The higher Gan Eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments. The compartments are not described, though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one's merit. The first compartment is for Jewish martyrs, the second for those who drowned, the third for \"Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai and his disciples,\" the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off, the fifth for penitents, the sixth for youths who have never sinned; and the seventh for the poor who lived decently and studied the Torah.\n\nIrving Greenberg, representing a Modern Orthodox viewpoint, describes the afterlife as a central Jewish teaching, deriving from the belief in reward and punishment. According to Greenberg, suffering Medieval Jews emphasized the World to Come as a counterpoint to the difficulties of this life, while early Jewish modernizers portrayed Judaism as interested only in this world as a counterpoint to \"otherworldly\" Christianity. Greenberg sees each of these views as leading to an undesired extreme - overemphasizing the afterlife leads to asceticism, while devaluing the afterlife deprives Jews of the consolation of eternal life and justice - and calls for a synthesis, in which Jews can work to perfect this world, while also recognizing the immortality of the soul.\n\nConservative Judaism both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the \"Amidah\" and Maimonides' Thirteen Precepts of Faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism affirm belief in the afterlife, though they downplay the theological implications in favor of emphasizing the importance of the \"here and now,\" as opposed to reward and punishment.\n\nSeveral times, the Bible alludes to eternal life without specifying what form that life will take.\n\nThe first explicit mention of resurrection is the Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones in the Book of Ezekiel. However, this narrative was intended as a metaphor for national rebirth, promising the Jews return to Israel and reconstruction of the Temple, not as a description of personal resurrection. \n\nThe Book of Daniel promised literal resurrection to the Jews, in concrete detail. Daniel wrote that with the coming of the Archangel Michael, misery would beset the world, and only those whose names were in a divine book would be resurrected. Moreover, Daniel's promise of resurrection was intended only for the most righteous and the most sinful because the afterlife was a place for the virtuous individuals to be rewarded and the sinful individuals to receive eternal punishment.\n\nGreek and Persian culture influenced Jewish sects to believe in an afterlife between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE as well.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible, at least as seen through interpretation of Bavli Sanhedrin, contains frequent reference to resurrection of the dead. The Mishnah (c. 200) lists belief in the resurrection of the dead as one of three essential beliefs necessary for a Jew to participate in it:\nIn the late Second Temple period, the Pharisees believed in resurrection, while Essenes and Sadducees did not. During the Rabbinic period, beginning in the late first century and carrying on to the present, the works of Daniel were included into the Hebrew Bible, signaling the adoption of Jewish resurrection into the officially sacred texts. \n\nJewish liturgy, most notably the \"Amidah\", contains references to the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead. In contemporary Judaism, both Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism maintain the traditional references to it in their liturgy. However, many Conservative Jews interpret the tenet metaphorically rather than literally. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have altered traditional references to the resurrection of the dead in the liturgy (\"who gives life to the dead\") to refer to \"who gives life to all.\"\n\nIn Judaism, the day of judgment happens every year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day of judgment for all mankind is disputed. Some rabbis hold that there will be such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that there is no need for that because of Rosh Hashanah. Yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Other rabbis hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.\n\nBULLET::::- Jewish Encyclopedia: Eschatology\nBULLET::::- The Origin of Jewish Eschatology, by Nathaniel Schmidt\nBULLET::::- THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN THE JEWISH APOCRYPHAL LITERATURE, by George Ladd, Gordon College\n"}

{"id": "16164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16164", "title": "John Macleod (physiologist)", "text": "John Macleod (physiologist)\n\nJohn James Rickard Macleod, FRS FRSE LLD (6 September 1876 – 16 March 1935) was a Scottish biochemist and physiologist. He devoted his career to diverse topics in physiology and biochemistry, but was chiefly interested in carbohydrate metabolism. He is noted for his role in the discovery and isolation of insulin during his tenure as a lecturer at the University of Toronto, for which he and Frederick Banting received the 1923 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine. Awarding the prize to Macleod was controversial at the time, because according to Banting's version of events, Macleod's role in the discovery was negligible. It was not until decades after the events that an independent review acknowledged a far greater role than was attributed to him at first.\n\nMacleod was born in Clunie, near Dunkeld in central Scotland. Soon after he was born, his father Robert Macleod, a clergyman, was transferred to Aberdeen, where John attended Aberdeen Grammar School and enrolled in the study of medicine at the University of Aberdeen. At the University of Aberdeen, one of MacLeod's principal teachers was the young professor John Alexander MacWilliam. He obtained a PhD in medicine in 1898 and then spent a year studying biochemistry at the University of Leipzig, Germany, on a travelling scholarship. After returning to Britain, he became a demonstrator at the London Hospital Medical School, where in 1902 he was appointed lecturer in biochemistry. In the same year, he was awarded a doctorate in public health from Cambridge University. Around that time he published his first research article, a paper on phosphorus content in muscles.\n\nIn 1903, Macleod emigrated to the United States and became a lecturer in physiology at the Western Reserve University (today's Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained for 15 years. During World War I, he performed various war-time duties and served as a physiology lecturer for part of the 1916 winter semester at the McGill University in Montreal, Canada. After the war, he went on to teach physiology at the University of Toronto, where he became director of the physiology lab and an assistant to the dean of the medical faculty. He researched various topics in physiology and biochemistry, among which were the chemism of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\", electroshocks, creatinine metabolism and blood circulation in the brain. In 1905 he became interested in carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes, publishing a series of scientific papers and several monographs on the subject from then on. Additionally, Macleod was a popular lecturer and an influential contributor to the development of the six-year course in medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Macleod was approached by Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian physician who had the idea of curing diabetes using an extract from a pancreas whose functioning had been disrupted. Macleod was not enthusiastic, because (unlike Banting) he knew about unsuccessful experiments in this direction by other researchers. He thought it more likely that the nervous system had a crucial role in regulating blood glucose concentration. Even though Banting had virtually no experience of physiology, he managed to convince Macleod to lend him laboratory space during a vacation in Scotland that summer. In addition to the laboratory, Macleod provided experimental animals and his student Charles Herbert Best, who worked as a demonstrator. Macleod also advised on project planning and the use of analytical techniques, and assisted with the operation on the first dog. While Macleod was away, Banting and Best achieved a breakthrough: they isolated an internal secretion of the pancreas and succeeded in reducing the blood sugar level of another dog, whose pancreas had been surgically removed.\n\nOn his return, Macleod was surprised and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting came to believe that he wanted to take all the credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of \"The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine\". Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.\n\nThe first human clinical trial was unsuccessful. Banting was insufficiently qualified to participate and felt sidelined. By the winter of 1922, he was certain that all Macleod's colleagues were conspiring against him. Collip threatened to leave because of the strained atmosphere, but the encouragement of others who saw the potential of their research prevented escalation of the conflict. In January 1922, the team performed the first successful clinical trial, on 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, and it was soon followed by others. Although all the team members were listed as co-authors of their publications, Banting still felt overlooked, because Macleod took over the coordination of clinical trials and the acquisition of larger amounts of extract. Macleod's presentation at a meeting of the Association of American Physicians in Washington, D.C., on 3 May 1922 received a standing ovation, but Banting and Best refused to participate in protest. At that time, demonstrations of the method's efficiency drew huge public interest, because the effect on patients, especially children, who until then were bound to die, seemed almost miraculous. The pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co. took over mass production, but without an exclusive license, as the patent was transferred to the British Medical Research Council to prevent exploitation.\n\nIn the summer of 1923 Macleod resumed other research. He took interest in teleost fish, which have separate regions of islet and acinar tissue in their pancreas. Working at the Marine Biological Station in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, he made extracts from each of those parts separately and proved that insulin is derived from the insular and not the acinar tissue of the pancreas. Meanwhile, Banting remained in Toronto and started to change the story to his own benefit. Relationships soon deteriorated again because of conflicting press accounts. Banting eventually started to claim that he deserved all the credit and that Macleod had only hindered him the whole time and had made no contribution other than to leave the keys to the laboratory when he went on vacation.\n\nMacleod returned to Scotland in 1928 to become Regius Professor of Physiology at Aberdeen University (in succession to his former teacher, John Alexander MacWilliam who retired in 1927) and later Dean of the University of Aberdeen Medical Faculty. Between 1929 and 1933 he was also a member of the Medical Research Council. He wrote a report on the discovery in 1922 to explain his side of the story, but otherwise refrained from active involvement in controversy about credit. Banting hated him passionately, and the two never spoke again.\n\nMacleod did not continue to work on insulin, but he remained active as a researcher, lecturer and author. His last major contribution was a proof that the central nervous system does have an important role in maintaining carbohydrate metabolism balance, as was his original hypothesis. His theory about conversion of fats into carbohydrates remained unproven, despite his provision of several indirect proofs. He devoted his spare time to golf, motorcycling and painting. He was married to Mary W. McWalter, but they never had children. He died in 1935 in Aberdeen after several years of suffering from arthritis, despite which he remained active almost until his death. In 1933 he made a lecture tour of the US, and in 1934 he published the 7th edition of his book \"Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine\".\n\nAfter Banting's death in a plane crash in 1941, Best, with the help of his friends, continued to spread Banting's account of the discovery and tried to \"write out\" Macleod and Collip from the history books. Only in 1950 was the first independent revision of all sides of the story made, and it gave credit to all four members of the team. However, Macleod's public image remained tainted for decades after that. The 1973 British television drama \"Comets Among the Stars\", for example, portrayed him as dark and repulsive. The second dramatization of the discovery, \"Glory Enough for All\" (1988), at last portrayed him more objectively. By then it was commonly accepted that Banting's and Best's story was distorted, since more documentation had been made publicly available, and it made a precise reconstruction of the events possible. Until Best died, this documentation had been kept secret for over 50 years by the University of Toronto, whose administration wanted to avoid fueling the controversy.\n\nMacleod was a prolific writer. His first academic article was a paper on phosphorus content in muscles published in 1899. During his career he authored or co-authored over 200 papers and eleven books. Among them are:\n\nBULLET::::- \"Practical Physiology\" (1903)\nBULLET::::- \"Recent Advances in Physiology\" (with Leonard E. Hill, 1905)\nBULLET::::- \"Diabetes: its Pathological Physiology\" (1913)\nBULLET::::- \"Physiology for dental students\" (with R.G. Pearce, 1915)\nBULLET::::- \"Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine\" (1st edition 1918)\nBULLET::::- \"Insulin and its Use in Diabetes\" (with W.R. Campbell, 1925)\nBULLET::::- \"Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin\" (1926)\nBULLET::::- \"The Fuel of life: Experimental Studies in Normal and Diabetic Animals\" (1928)\n\nJohn Macleod was a distinguished physiologist even before the discovery of insulin. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1919 and president of American Physiological Society in 1921. Among the recognitions he received after 1923 were memberships of the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, corresponding membership of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and honorary membership of the Regia Accademia Medica. His reputation in Canada remained under the influence of Banting's story for decades, so Macleod was not esteemed there.\n\nHis contribution to science is now recognized by the broad public, even in Canada. The auditorium of the Toronto University Medical Research Center was named in his honor, as was Diabetes UK's award for patients who survive for 70 years with diabetes. In 2012, he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Nobel Committee reacted almost immediately to the first successful clinical trials. In the autumn of 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, even though the long-term importance of the discovery was not yet apparent. They were nominated by the Danish physiologist and Nobel laureate August Krogh, who had a diabetic wife and had visited Macleod's laboratory and taken the method back to Denmark. The committee judged that Macleod's work in interpreting the data, managing the clinical trials and providing a high level of public presentation were crucial for success, so they awarded the Nobel prize to both. Banting was furious, as he was convinced that Best should have received the other half, and he even thought of rejecting the prize. He was finally persuaded to accept it but gave half of his prize money to Best. Macleod in turn gave half of his to Collip. In 1972 the Nobel Foundation officially conceded that omitting Best was a mistake.\n\nA second controversial aspect of the award was the fact that eight months before Banting's and Best's paper, the Romanian physiologist Nicolae Paulescu had reported the discovery of a pancreas extract that he dubbed \"pancrein\", which lowered blood glucose concentration. Banting and Best even cited him in their paper, but misinterpreted his findings, purportedly because of an error in translation from French. Best publicly apologized for that mistake many years later.\n\nBULLET::::- List of Case Western people\n\nBULLET::::- John Macleod – Biography\nBULLET::::- John Macleod – Nobel Lecture, 26 May 1925\n"}
{"id": "16167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16167", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi", "text": "Jackson, Mississippi\n\nJackson, officially the City of Jackson, is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Mississippi. It is one of two county seats of Hinds County, along with Raymond, Mississippi. The city of Jackson also includes around 3,000 acres comprising Jackson-Medgar Evers International Airport in Rankin County and a small portion of Madison County. The city's population was estimated to be 165,072 in 2017, a decline from 173,514 in 2010. The city sits on the Pearl River and is located in the greater Jackson Prairie region of Mississippi.\n\nFounded in 1821 as the site for a new state capital, the city is named after General Andrew Jackson, who was honored for his role in the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812 and would later serve as U.S. president. Following the nearby Battle of Vicksburg in 1863 during the American Civil War, Union forces under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman began the Siege of Jackson and the city was subsequently burned.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Jackson surpassed Meridian to become the most populous city in the state following a speculative natural gas boom in the region. The current slogan for the city is \"The City with Soul\". It has had numerous musicians prominent in blues, gospel, folk, and jazz.\n\nJackson is the anchor for the Jackson, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the state's largest metropolitan area with a 2016 population of 579,332, about one-fifth of Mississippi's population.\n\nThe region that is now the city of Jackson was historically part of the large territory occupied by the Choctaw Nation, the historic culture of the Muskogean-speaking indigenous peoples who had inhabited the area for thousands of years before European colonization. The Choctaw name for the locale was \"Chisha Foka\". The area now called Jackson was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Doak's Stand in 1820, by which The United States acquired the land owned by the Choctaw Native Americans. After the treaty was ratified, American settlers moved into the area, encroaching on remaining Choctaw communal lands. One of the original Choctaw members, in 1849, described what he and his people experienced during this turbulent time when the Europeans had come to take their land. \"We have had our habitations torn down and burned\" as well as their \"fences burned\" while they themselves constantly faced personal abuse and have been \"scoured, manacled and fettered\".\n\nUnder pressure from the U.S. government, the Choctaw Native Americans agreed to removal after 1830 from all of their lands east of the Mississippi River under the terms of several treaties. Although most of the Choctaw moved to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma, along with the other of the Five Civilized Tribes, a significant number chose to stay in their homeland, citing Article XIV of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. They gave up their tribal membership and became state and United States citizens at the time. Today, most Choctaw in Mississippi have reorganized and are part of the federally recognized Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. They live in several majority-Indian communities located throughout the state. The largest community is located in Choctaw northeast of Jackson.\n\nLocated on the historic Natchez Trace trade route, created by Native Americans and used by European-American settlers, and on the Pearl River, the city's first European-American settler was Louis LeFleur, a French-Canadian trader. The village became known as LeFleur's Bluff. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, this site had a trading post. It was connected to markets in Tennessee. Soldiers returning to Tennessee from the military campaigns near New Orleans in 1815 built a public road that connected Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana to this district. A United States treaty with the Choctaw, the Treaty of Doak's Stand in 1820, formally opened the area for non-Native American settlers.\n\nLeFleur's Bluff was developed when it was chosen as the site for the new state's capital city. The Mississippi General Assembly decided in 1821 that the state needed a centrally located capital (the legislature was then located in Natchez). They commissioned Thomas Hinds, James Patton, and William Lattimore to look for a suitable site. The absolute center of the state was a swamp, so the group had to widen their search.\n\nAfter surveying areas north and east of Jackson, they proceeded southwest along the Pearl River until they reached LeFleur's Bluff in today's Hinds County. Their report to the General Assembly stated that this location had beautiful and healthful surroundings, good water, abundant timber, navigable waters, and proximity to the Natchez Trace. The Assembly passed an act on November 28, 1821, authorizing the site as the permanent seat of the government of the state of Mississippi. On the same day, it passed a resolution to instruct the Washington delegation to press Congress for a donation of public lands on the river for the purpose of improved navigation to the Gulf of Mexico. One Whig politician lamented the new capital as a \"serious violation of principle\" because it was not at the absolute center of the state.\n\nThe capital was named for General Andrew Jackson, to honor his (January 1815) victory at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. He was later elected as the seventh president of the United States.\n\nThe city of Jackson was originally planned, in April 1822, by Peter Aaron Van Dorn in a \"checkerboard\" pattern advocated by Thomas Jefferson. City blocks alternated with parks and other open spaces. Over time, many of the park squares have been developed rather than maintained as green space. The state legislature first met in Jackson on December 23, 1822. In 1839, the Mississippi Legislature passed the first state law in the U.S. to permit married women to own and administer their own property.\n\nJackson was connected by public road to Vicksburg and Clinton in 1826. Jackson was first connected by railroad to other cities in 1840. An 1844 map shows Jackson linked by an east-west rail line running between Vicksburg, Raymond, and Brandon. Unlike Vicksburg, Greenville, and Natchez, Jackson is not located on the Mississippi River, and it did not develop during the antebellum era as those cities did from major river commerce. Construction of railroad lines to the city sparked its growth in the decades following the American Civil War.\n\nDespite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the Confederacy. In 1863, during the military campaign which ended in the capture of Vicksburg, Union forces captured Jackson during two battles—once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.\n\nOn May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first Battle of Jackson, forcing Confederate forces to flee northward towards Canton. On May 15, Union troops under the command of William Tecumseh Sherman burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the Confederacy. After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the Battle of Champion Hill in nearby Edwards. The Union forces began their siege of Vicksburg soon after their victory at Champion Hill. Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the siege. The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive fortifications encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.\n\nConfederate forces marched out of Jackson in early July 1863 to break the siege of Vicksburg. But, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863. General Ulysses S. Grant dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated into Jackson. Union forces began the Siege of Jackson, which lasted for approximately one week. Union forces encircled the city and began an artillery bombardment. One of the Union artillery emplacements has been preserved on the grounds of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Another Federal position is preserved on the campus of Millsaps College. John C. Breckinridge, former United States Vice President, served as one of the Confederate generals defending Jackson. On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.\n\nUnion forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time. The city was called \"Chimneyville\" because only the chimneys of houses were left standing. The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as Fortification Street.\n\nBecause of the siege and following destruction, few antebellum structures have survived in Jackson. The Governor's Mansion, built in 1842, served as Sherman's headquarters and has been preserved. Another is the Old Capitol building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of secession from the Union on January 9, 1861 there, becoming the second state to secede from the United States. The Jackson City Hall, built in 1846 for less than $8,000, also survived. It is said that Sherman, a Mason, spared it because it housed a Masonic Lodge, though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain supremacy. In 1875, the Red Shirts were formed, one of a second wave of insurgent paramilitary organizations that essentially operated as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\" to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive blacks from the polls. Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced Mississippi's Constitution of 1890, was also held at the capitol.\n\nThis was the first of new constitutions or amendments ratified in each Southern state through 1908 that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites, through provisions making voter registration more difficult: such as poll taxes, residency requirements, and literacy tests. These provisions survived a Supreme Court challenge in 1898. As 20th-century Supreme Court decisions later ruled such provisions were unconstitutional, Mississippi and other Southern states rapidly devised new methods to continue disfranchisement of most blacks, who comprised a majority in the state until the 1930s. Their exclusion from politics was maintained into the late 1960s.\n\nThe economic recovery from the Civil War was slow through the start of the 20th century, but there were some developments in transportation. In 1871, the city introduced mule-drawn streetcars which ran on State Street, which were replaced by electric ones in 1899.\n\nThe so-called New Capitol replaced the older structure upon its completion in 1903. Today the Old Capitol is operated as a historical museum.\n\nAuthor Eudora Welty was born in Jackson in 1909, lived most of her life in the Belhaven section of the city, and died there in 2001. Her memoir of development as a writer, \"One Writer's Beginnings\" (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early 20th century. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel, \"The Optimist's Daughter,\" and is best known for her novels and short stories. The main Jackson Public Library was named in her honor, and her home has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nRichard Wright, a highly acclaimed African-American author, lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s. He related his experience in his memoir \"Black Boy\" (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and in Northern ghettos such as Chicago under segregation in the early 20th century.\nJackson had significant growth in the early 20th century, which produced dramatic changes in the city's skyline. Jackson's new Union Station downtown reflected the city's service by multiple rail lines, including the Illinois Central. The railroads were among the new work opportunities for African Americans, who moved into the city from rural areas for such industrial-type jobs.\n\nAcross the street, the new, luxurious King Edward Hotel opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect William T. Nolan. It became a center for prestigious events held by Jackson society and Mississippi politicians. Nearby, the 18-story Standard Life Building, designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion.\n\nJackson's economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of natural gas fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state's property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.\n\nMississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo stated:\n\nThis enthusiasm was subdued when the first wells failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success. The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of salt water, which lessened the quality. The governor's prediction was wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry did provide an economic boost for the city and state. The effects of the Great Depression were mitigated by the industry's success. At its height in 1934, there were 113 producing wells in the state. The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.\n\nDue to provisions in the federal Rivers and Harbors Act, on October 25, 1930, city leaders met with U.S. Army engineers to ask for federal help to alleviate Jackson flooding. J.J. Halbert, city engineer, proposed a straightening and dredging of the Pearl River below Jackson.\n\nDuring Mississippi's extended Prohibition period, from the 1920s until the 1960s, illegal drinking and gambling casinos flourished on the east side of the Pearl River, in Flowood along the original U.S. Route 80 just across from the city of Jackson. Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly black-market businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.\n\nThe Gold Coast declined and businesses disappeared after Mississippi's prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go \"wet\". In addition, integration drew off business from establishments that earlier had catered to African Americans, such as the Summers Hotel. When it opened in 1943 on Pearl Street, it was one of two hotels in the city that served black clients. For years its Subway Lounge was a prime performance spot for black musicians playing jazz and blues.\n\nIn another major change, in 1990 the state approved gaming on riverboats. Numerous casinos have been developed on riverboats, mostly in Mississippi Delta towns such as Tunica Resorts, Greenville, and Vicksburg, as well as Biloxi on the Gulf Coast. Before the damage and losses due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the state ranked second nationally in gambling revenues.\n\nDuring World War II, Hawkins Field in northwest Jackson was developed as a major airbase. Among other facilities and units, the was established there, after Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands. From 1941, the base trained all Dutch military aircrews.\n\nIn 1949, the poet Margaret Walker began teaching at Jackson State University, a historically black college. She taught there until 1979, and founded the university's Center for African-American Studies. Her poetry collection won a Yale Younger Poets Prize. Her second novel, \"Jubilee\" (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She has influenced many younger writers.\n\nThe civil rights movement had been active for decades, particularly mounting legal challenges to Mississippi's constitution and laws that disfranchised blacks. Beginning in 1960, Jackson as the state capital became the site for dramatic non-violent protests in a new phase of activism that brought in a wide variety of participants in the performance of mass demonstrations.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Jackson's population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black. At the time, public facilities were segregated and Jim Crow was in effect. Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began when nine Tougaloo College students tried to read books in the \"white only\" public library and were arrested. Founded as a historically black college (HBCU) by the American Missionary Association after the Civil War, Tougaloo College helped organize both black and white students of the region to work together for civil rights. It created partnerships with the neighboring mostly white Millsaps College to work with student activists. It has been recognized as a site on the \"Civil Rights Trail\" by the National Park Service.\n\nThe mass demonstrations of the 1960s were initiated with the arrival of more than 300 Freedom Riders on May 24, 1961. They were arrested in Jackson for disturbing the peace after they disembarked from their interstate buses. The interracial teams rode the buses from Washington, D.C. and sat together to demonstrate against segregation on public transportation, as the Constitution provides for unrestricted public transportation. Although the Freedom Riders had intended New Orleans as their final destination, Jackson was the farthest that any managed to travel. New participants kept joining the movement, as they intended to fill the jails in Jackson with their protest. The riders had encountered extreme violence along the way, including a bus burning and physical assaults. They attracted national media attention to the struggle for constitutional rights.\n\nAfter the Freedom Rides, students and activists of the Freedom Movement launched a series of merchant boycotts, sit-ins and protest marches, from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers. For instance, at the time, department stores did not hire black salesclerks or allow black customers to use their fitting rooms to try on clothes, or lunch counters for meals while in the store, but they wanted them to shop in their stores.\n\nIn Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers, civil rights activist and leader of the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP, was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist associated with the White Citizens' Council. Thousands marched in Evers' funeral procession to protest the killing. Two trials at the time both resulted in hung juries. A portion of U.S. Highway 49, all of Delta Drive, a library, the central post office for the city, and Jackson–Evers International Airport were named in honor of Medgar Evers. In 1994, prosecutors Ed Peters and Bobby DeLaughter finally obtained a murder conviction in a state trial of De La Beckwith based on new evidence.\n\nDuring 1963 and 1964, civil rights organizers gathered local residents for voter education and voter registration. Blacks had been essentially disfranchised since 1890. In a pilot project in 1963, activists rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote. In 1964 they created the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party as an alternative to the all-white state Democratic Party, and sent an alternate slate of candidates to the national Democratic Party convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, that year.\n\nSegregation and the disfranchisement of African Americans gradually ended after the Civil Rights Movement gained Congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In June 1966, Jackson was the terminus of the James Meredith March, organized by James Meredith, the first African American to enroll at the University of Mississippi. The march, which began in Memphis, Tennessee, was an attempt to garner support for full implementation of civil rights in practice, following the legislation. It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper's bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.\n\nIn September 1967 a Ku Klux Klan chapter bombed the synagogue of the Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson, and in November bombed the house of its rabbi, Dr. Perry Nussbaum. He and his congregation had supported civil rights.\n\nGradually the old barriers came down. Since that period, both whites and African Americans in the state have had a consistently high rate of voter registration and turnout. Following the decades of the Great Migration, when more than one million blacks left the rural South, since the 1930s the state has been majority white in total population. African Americans are a majority in the city of Jackson, although the metropolitan area is majority white. African Americans are also a majority in several cities and counties of the Mississippi Delta, which are included in the 2nd congressional district. The other three congressional districts are majority white.\n\nThe first successful cadaveric lung transplant was performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson in June 1963 by Dr. James Hardy. Hardy transplanted the cadaveric lung into a patient suffering from lung cancer. The patient survived for eighteen days before dying of kidney failure.\n\nIn 1966 it was estimated that recurring flood damage at Jackson from the Pearl River averaged nearly a million dollars per year. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spent $6.8 million on levees and a new channel in 1966 prior to the project completion with the aim to prevent a flood equal to the December 1961 event plus an additional foot.\n\nSince 1968, Jackson has been the home of Malaco Records, one of the leading record companies for gospel, blues, and soul music in the United States. In January 1973, Paul Simon recorded the songs \"Learn How to Fall\" and \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\", found on the album \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\", in Jackson at the Malaco Recording Studios. Many well-known Southern artists recorded on the album, including the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, Roger Hawkins, Barry Beckett), Carson Whitsett, the Onward Brass Band from New Orleans, and others. The label has recorded many leading soul and blues artists, including Bobby Bland, ZZ Hill, Latimore, Shirley Brown, Denise LaSalle, and Tyrone Davis.\n\nOn May 15, 1970, Jackson police killed two students and wounded twelve at Jackson State College after a protest of the Vietnam War included students' overturning and burning some cars. These killings occurred eleven days after the National Guard killed four students in an anti-war protest at Kent State University in Ohio, and were part of national social unrest. \"Newsweek\" cited the Jackson State killings in its issue of May 18 when it suggested that U.S. President Richard Nixon faced a new home front.\n\nThe influx of illegal drugs nationally affected Jackson as smugglers used the highways, seaports, and airports of the Gulf region. The 1980s in Jackson were dominated by Mayor Dale Danks Jr. until he was unseated by lawyer and legislator J. Kane Ditto, who criticized the deficit funding and the politicized police department of the city. Federal investigations of drug trafficking at Jackson's Hawkins Field airport were a part of the \"Kerry Report,\" the 1986 U.S. Senate investigation of public corruption and foreign relations.\n\nAs Jackson has become the medical and legal center of the state, it has attracted Jewish professionals in both fields. Since the late 20th century, it has developed the largest Jewish community in the state.\n\nIn 1997, Harvey Johnson, Jr. was elected as Jackson's first African-American mayor. During his term, he proposed the development of a convention center to attract more business to the city. In 2004, during his second term, 66 percent of the voters passed a referendum for a tax to build the Convention Center.\n\nMayor Johnson was replaced by Frank Melton on July 4, 2005. Melton generated controversy through his unconventional behavior, which included acting as a law enforcement officer. A dramatic spike in crime ensued during his term, despite Melton's efforts to reduce crime. The lack of jobs contributed to crime. In 2006 a young African-American businessman, Starsky Darnell Redd, was convicted of money laundering in federal court along with his mother, other associates, and Billy Tucker, the former airport security chief. Redd had been convicted in 2002 for drug trafficking $8,000,000 worth of narcotics into Jackson.\n\nIn 2007 Hinds County sheriff Malcolm McMillin was appointed as the new police chief in Jackson, setting a historic precedent. McMillin was both the county sheriff and city police chief until 2009, when he stepped down due to the disagreements with the mayor. Mayor Frank Melton died in May 2009, and City Councilman Leslie McLemore served as acting mayor of Jackson until July 2009, when former Mayor Harvey Johnson was elected and assumed the position.\n\nOn June 26, 2011, 49-year-old James Craig Anderson was killed in Jackson after being beaten, robbed, and run over by a group of white teenagers. The district attorney described it as a \"hate crime\", and the FBI investigated it as a civil rights violation.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, a severe hailstorm hit the Jackson metro area. The hail caused major damage to roofs, vehicles, and building siding. Hail ranged in size from golfball to softball. There were more than 40,000 hailstorm claims of homeowner and automobile damage.\n\nIn 2013, Jackson was named as one of the top 10 friendliest cities in the United States by \"CN Traveler\". The capital city was tied with Natchez as Number 7. The city was noticed for friendly people, great food, and green and pretty public places.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, Chokwe Lumumba was sworn into office as mayor of the city. After eight months in office, Lumumba died on February 25, 2014. Lumumba was a popular yet controversial figure due to his prior membership in the Republic of New Afrika, as well as being a co-founder of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America.\n\nLumumba's son, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, ran for the mayoral seat following his father's death, but lost to Councillor Tony Yarber on April 22, 2014. In 2017, however, Chokwe Antar Lumumba ran for mayor again, and won. Following his victory, on June 26 he was interviewed by Amy Goodman on \"Democracy Now!\", at which time he declared a commitment to make Jackson the \"Most Radical City on the Planet\".\n\nJackson is located primarily in northeastern Hinds County, with small portions in Madison and Rankin counties. The Pearl River forms most of the eastern border of the city. A small portion of the city containing Tougaloo College lies in Madison County, bounded on the west by Interstate 220 and on the east by U.S. Route 51 and Interstate 55. An unconnected section of the city surrounds Jackson–Evers International Airport in Rankin County. In the 2010 census, only 622 of the city's residents lived in Madison County, and only 1 lived within the city limits in Rankin County. The city is bordered to the north by Ridgeland in Madison County, to the northeast by Ross Barnett Reservoir on the Pearl River, to the east by Flowood and Richland in Rankin County, to the south by Byram in Hinds County, and to the west by Clinton in Hinds County.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.94% of the total, are water.\n\nBULLET::::- Interstate 55\nBULLET::::- Interstate 20\nBULLET::::- Interstate 220\nBULLET::::- US 51\nBULLET::::- US 49\nBULLET::::- US 80\n\nJackson sits atop the extinct Jackson Volcano, located underground. It is the only capital city in the United States to have this feature. The buried peak of the volcano is located directly below the Mississippi Coliseum. The municipality is drained on the west by tributaries of the Big Black River and on the east by the Pearl River, which is higher than the Big Black near Canton. The artesian ground water flow is not as extensive in Jackson for this reason. The first large-scale well was drilled in the city in 1896, and the city water supply has relied on surface water resources.\n\nJackson is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen \"Cfa\"). Rain occurs throughout the year, though the winter and spring are the wettest seasons, and the late summer and early autumn is usually the driest time of the year. Snow is rare, and accumulation very seldom lasts more than a day. The mean annual precipitation is about , see climate table. Much of Jackson's rainfall occurs during thunderstorms. Thunder is heard on roughly 70 days each year. Jackson lies in a region prone to severe thunderstorms which can produce large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes. Among the most notable tornado events was the F5 Candlestick Park tornado on March 3, 1966, which destroyed the shopping center of the same name and surrounding businesses and residential areas, killing 19 in South Jackson.\n\nThe record low temperature is , set on January 27, 1940, and the record high is , last recorded August 30, 2000.\nJackson remained a small town for much of the 19th century. Before the Civil War, Jackson's population remained small, particularly in contrast to the river towns along the commerce-laden Mississippi River. Despite the city's status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, and by 1900 the population of Jackson was still less than 8,000. Although it expanded rapidly, during this period Meridian became Mississippi's largest city, based on trade, manufacturing, and access to transportation via railroad and highway.\n\nIn the early 20th century, as can be seen by the table, Jackson had its largest rates of growth, but ranked second to Meridian in Mississippi. By 1944, Jackson's population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants, and it became the largest city in the state. It has maintained its position, achieving a peak population in the 1980 census of more than 200,000 residents in the city. Since then, Jackson has steadily seen a decline in its population, while its suburbs have had a boom. This change has occurred in part due to white flight, but it also demonstrates the national suburbanization trend, in which wealthier residents moved out to newer housing. This decline slowed in the first decade of the 21st century.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 173,514 people, and 62,400 households. The population density was . There were 74,537 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 79.4% Black or African American, 18.4% White or Euro American, 0.1% Native American, 0.4% Asian, and 0.9% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Non-Hispanic Whites were 18% of the population in 2010, down from 60% in 1970.\n\nThere were 267,841 households out of which 39.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 35.4% were married couples living together, 25.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.8% had a male householder with no wife present, and 34.4% were non-families. 28.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.24. Same-sex couple households comprised 0.8% of all households.\n\nThe age of the population was spread out with 28.5% under the age of 18, 12.4% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 86.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 81.5 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $30,414, and the median income for a family was $36,003. Males had a median income of $29,166 versus $23,328 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,116. About 19.6% of families and 23.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.7% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\nJackson is served by Jackson–Evers International Airport, located at Allen C. Thompson Field, east of Jackson and north of Pearl in Rankin County. Its IATA code is JAN. The airport has non-stop service to eight cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Denver, and Charlotte) throughout the United States and is served by five scheduled carriers (American, Delta, United, Frontier, and ViaAir). Jackson became one of the only cities to ever lose Southwest Airlines service when the carrier ceased service in the summer of 2014.\n\nOn December 22, 2004, the Jackson City Council voted 6–0 to rename Jackson International Airport in honor of slain civil rights leader and field secretary for the Mississippi chapter of the NAACP, Medgar Evers. This decision took effect on January 22, 2005.\n\nFormerly Jackson was served by Hawkins Field Airport, located in northwest Jackson, with IATA code HKS, which is now used for private air traffic only.\n\nUnderway is the Airport Parkway project. The environmental impact study is complete and final plans are drawn and awaiting Mississippi Department of Transportation approval. Right-of-way acquisition is underway at an estimated cost of $19 million. The Airport Parkway will connect High Street in downtown Jackson to Mississippi Highway 475 in Flowood at Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Airport Parkway Commission consists of the Mayor of Pearl, the Mayor of Flowood, and the Mayor of Jackson, as the Airport Parkway will run through and have access from each of these three cities.\n\n Interstate 20Runs east-west from near El Paso, Texas to Florence, South Carolina. Jackson is roughly halfway between Dallas and Atlanta. The highway is six lanes from Interstate 220 to MS 468 in Pearl.\n\n U.S. Highway 49Runs north-south from the Arkansas state line at Lula via Clarksdale and Yazoo City, towards Hattiesburg and Gulfport. It bypasses the city via I-20 and I-220\n\n Mississippi Highway 18Runs southwest towards Raymond and Port Gibson; southeast towards Bay Springs and Quitman.\n\nIn addition, Jackson is served by the Natchez Trace Parkway, which runs from Natchez to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nJATRAN (Jackson Transit System) operates hourly or half-hourly during daytime hours on weekdays, and mostly hourly on Saturdays. No evening or Sunday service provided.\n\nAmtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson. The Amtrak station is located at 300 West Capitol Street. The southbound \"City of New Orleans\" provides service from Jackson to New Orleans and some points between; it leaves at 11:20 a.m. and arrives in New Orleans about 3:30 p.m. The northbound \"City of New Orleans\" provides service from Jackson to Memphis, Carbondale, Champaign-Urbana, Chicago, and some points between. It leaves at 5:40 p.m., arrives in Memphis at 10 p.m., and in Chicago at 9 a.m. the new day. Efforts to establish service with another long-distance train, the proposed \"Crescent Star\", an extension of the \"Crescent\" westward from Meridian, Mississippi, to Dallas, failed in 2003, because Congress refused any growth in Amtrak routes. This would have represented the first instance of passenger trains from Meridian, Mississippi to Jackson, to Shreveport, Louisiana since the 1967 cancellation of the Illinois Central Railroad's \"Southwestern Limited.\"\n\nDuring the two waves of Great Migration in the 20th century, thousands of African Americans used trains to move to Northern and Midwestern cities, with many traveling to Chicago from rural Mississippi. They settled in neighborhoods with people they had known at home.\n\nThe growth of competition from highways and airline traffic meant widespread restructuring in the railroad industry since the mid-20th century. Passenger service was decreased, as people increasingly chose to use cars and planes. For freight traffic, Jackson is served by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS). CN has a medium-sized yard downtown which Mill Street parallels, and KCS has a large classification yard in Richland.\n\nIn 2015, 11 percent of city of Jackson households lacked a car, which decreased to 7.6 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Jackson averaged 1.68 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.\n\nJackson is home to several major industries. These include electrical equipment and machinery, processed food, and primary and fabricated metal products. The surrounding area supports agricultural development of livestock, soybeans, cotton, and poultry.\n\nThe following companies are headquartered in Jackson:\nBULLET::::- Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.

The organization has led to the creation of several businesses including lawn care provider The Green Team, organic farm Freedom Farms, print shop The Center for Community Production, and The Balagoon Center, which is a cooperative business incubator. \n\nIn 1993 Jackson had the nation's 12th highest homicide rate among cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to the FBI. The 87 slayings in the city in 1993 gave Jackson a homicide rate of 41.9 per 100,000 residents, the FBI reported, and set a new record for the most violent deaths in one year. 1994 had higher homicides, with 91, and the record would be broken again in 1995 with a total of 92.\n\nBULLET::::- Jackson is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi.\nBULLET::::- It is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson.\nBULLET::::- The original campus of the Reformed Theological Seminary is located here.\nBULLET::::- This is the site of the Mississippi Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church.\nBULLET::::- The First Presbyterian Church in Jackson is one of the largest Presbyterian churches in the South.\nBULLET::::- Jackson is the headquarters of the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A., founded by Charles Price Jones.\nBULLET::::- Congregation Beth Israel, the only Jewish congregation in Jackson, is the largest in Mississippi.\nBULLET::::- The Sikh Foundation of Greater Mississippi is based in Jackson.\nBULLET::::- Historic Fondren Presbyterian Church in the Downtown Fondren neighborhood was the first all white church in the state to integrate in 1964.\n\nBULLET::::- Ballet Mississippi\nBULLET::::- Celtic Heritage Society of Mississippi\nBULLET::::- Crossroads Film Society and its annual Film Festival\nBULLET::::- International Museum of Muslim Cultures\nBULLET::::- Jackson State University Botanical Garden\nBULLET::::- Jackson Zoo\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Arts Center\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Chorus\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Civil Rights Museum\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Department of Archives and History, which contains the state archives and records\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Heritage Trust\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Hispanic Association\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Metropolitan Ballet\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Opera\nBULLET::::- Mississippi Symphony Orchestra (MSO), formerly the Jackson Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1944\nBULLET::::- Municipal Art Gallery\nBULLET::::- Museum of Mississippi History\nBULLET::::- Mynelle Gardens\nBULLET::::- New Stage Theatre\nBULLET::::- Russell C.

This electoral system enables wider representation of residents on the city council. City council members are elected from each of the city's seven wards, considered single-member districts. The mayor is elected at-large citywide.\n\nJackson's mayor is Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D).\n(D) on July 3, 2017.\nJackson's City Council members are:\nBULLET::::- Ward 1: Ashby Foote\nBULLET::::- Ward 2: Melvin Priester, Jr.\nBULLET::::- Ward 3: Kenneth Stokes\nBULLET::::- Ward 4: De'Keither Stamps\nBULLET::::- Ward 5: Charles H.

U.S. Representative Bennie Gordon Thompson, a Democrat, has served since 1993. Until 2011 he was Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and has been the ranking member since 2011 then.[1]\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Jackson Main Post Office and several smaller post offices.\n\nOn March 27, 2015, Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency for transportation (potholes) and water infrastructure (breaks in water mains). The quality of Jackson's water infrastructure system decreased after the severe winter weather of 2014–2015. Jackson's office estimated the cost to fix the roads and water pipes at $750 million to $1 billion.\n\nAfter issuing the state of emergency, the City of Jackson filed a letter of intent to Department of Health to borrow $2.5 million to repair broken water pipes. The Jackson City Council must approve the mayor's proposal. Additionally, Mayor Yarber asked for help from both FEMA and the state Governor's office.\n\nCalling for a state of emergency increases the likelihood that the U.S. Department of Transportation would give the city money from a \"quick release\" funding account.\n\nJackson is home to the most collegiate institutions in Mississippi.

{"id": "16175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16175", "title": "Jennifer Lopez", "text": "Jennifer Lopez\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname J.Lo, is an American actress, singer, dancer, fashion designer, producer and businesswoman. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on \"In Living Color\", where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez received a Golden Globe nomination and became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in \"Anaconda\" (1997) and \"Out of Sight\" (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.\n\nLopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album \"On the 6\" (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album \"J.Lo\" and her romantic comedy \"The Wedding Planner\" in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, \"J to tha L–O! The Remixes\", became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album \"This Is Me... Then\", and appeared in \"Maid in Manhattan\".\n\nAfter starring in \"Gigli\" (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies \"Shall We Dance?\" (2004) and \"Monster-in-Law\" (2005). Her fifth studio album, \"Como Ama una Mujer\" (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on \"American Idol\", and released her seventh studio album \"Love?\". From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the crime drama series \"Shades of Blue\" and performed a residency show, , at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on \"World of Dance\". In 2019, she received critical praise for starring as a stripper in the crime drama \"Hustlers\", for which she earned Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. \n\nWith a cumulative film gross of and estimated global sales of 80 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, \"Forbes\" ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world. \"Time\" listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 include: \"If You Had My Love\", \"I'm Real\", \"Ain't It Funny\", \"All I Have\", and \"On the Floor\", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time. For her contributions to the music industry, Lopez has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the \"Billboard\" Icon Award, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award among other honors. Her other ventures include clothing lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation.\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in The Bronx borough of New York City, to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez and David López. She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist. David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family. At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School. In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school's softball team. She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.\n\nWhile attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in \"My Little Girl\" (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and \"Oklahoma!\". From there, she was hired for the chorus in a \"Golden Musicals of Broadway\", which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show \"Synchronicity\" in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.\n\nLopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of \"Games\" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards. Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program \"In Living Color\". She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson. Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her \"own thing\".\n\nLopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film \"Lost in the Wild\" (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia. Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series \"Second Chances\". Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama \"My Family\" portraying Young Maria. Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance. In November 1995, Lopez starred in \"Money Train\" alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy \"Jack\".\n\nIn February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller \"Blood and Wine\". Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March. Despite having previously worked with the film's director on \"My Family\", Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film. Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that even in the \"forgettable films\" \"Money Train\", and \"Jack\", Lopez's \"presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom\" and with \"Selena\" she's \"seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers\". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena's life, but also of the actress who portrayed her. The announcement was described as the \"role of a lifetime.\" from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million, which made Lopez the highest-paid Hispanic actress in history. After filming \"Selena\", Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, titled \"Vivir Sin Ti\" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.\n\nIn April, Lopez starred in the horror film \"Anaconda\" alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight. Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film \"U Turn\" in October. The film, which is based on the novel \"Stray Dogs\" by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics. In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in \"Out of Sight\", Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name (1996). Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance. Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film \"Antz\" in October.\n\nLopez's debut single, \"If You Had My Love\", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album. Lopez became the first artist to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. During production of her debut album, \"On the 6\", Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" \"Waiting for Tonight\", the third single from \"On the 6\", is widely considered to be Lopez's best song. Lopez's musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star. She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).\n\nOn February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress \"had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,\" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe. The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event. Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea \"it was going to become such a big deal\". Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller \"The Cell\" opposite Vincent D'Onofrio.\n\nDuring the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She started going by J.Lo, something fans often called her. She subsequently named the album \"J.Lo\". Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. During the same week, her romantic comedy film \"The Wedding Planner\" in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States. The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\", which reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single \"Play\". In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that \"the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored\" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes. The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film \"Angel Eyes\", which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews. After several months, \"J.Lo\" was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song \"I'm Real\". This led to the release of \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", which quickly reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Its success resulted in \"J.Lo\" being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks. \"J.Lo\" became the best-selling album of Lopez's career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.\n\nHaving redefined Lopez's sound with \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to \"keep the momentum going\". A remix album entitled \"J to tha L–O! The Remixes\" was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the \"Billboard\" 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US. \"J to tha L–O! The Remixes\" became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US. It produced two more singles: \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" and \"Alive\", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè's. The following month, she starred in the thriller film \"Enough\", which was described by the \"Boston Herald\" as a \"kick-but, female empowerment\" film. While filming \"Enough\", which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling \"sick and weird\", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, \"I was like – I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.\" In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.\n\nLopez's third studio album, \"This Is Me... Then\", was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album's lead single \"Jenny from the Block\", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single. In the song, Lopez \"intones her modest childhood roots\". The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US. Its second single, \"All I Have\", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy \"Maid in Manhattan\", which became the highest-grossing film of her career.\n\nIn August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy \"Gigli\". The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film. Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying \"[It] was very tough\", \"the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.\" In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a \"more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.\" Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.\n\nIn March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film \"Jersey Girl\", alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple's break-up, it was noted that \"they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come\". In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama \"Shall We Dance?\", a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following \"Gigli\".\n\nAfter placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, \"Rebirth\", in February 2005. According to Lopez, \"Rebirth\" \"came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.\" Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after \"fawning\" over Affleck on \"This Is Me... Then\"\", Lopez \"wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight\" on \"Rebirth\" and only references her relationship with singer/actor Marc Anthony on a few tracks. The album produced the single \"Get Right\", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom. In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy \"Monster-in-Law\", for which she received a salary of $15 million. The film's marketing played up Lopez's \"\"Gigli\"-and-tabloid tarnished image\", and it became a box office success. In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in \"An Unfinished Life\", a drama film based on the novel of the same name.\n\nIn April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 as a featured artist on \"Control Myself\", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album \"Todd Smith\". The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair's second collaboration to reach the top five. \"Bordertown\", a film based on the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film's producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. \"Bordertown\" received a direct-to-video release. \"DanceLife\", a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show. According to the album's co-producer Estéfano, Lopez's fifth studio album \"Como Ama una Mujer\" would \"prove critics wrong\" with its \"big songs that require a voice\"; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a \"limited\" vocal tone. The album's lead single \"Qué Hiciste\" reached number one on \"Billboard\"s Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of \"American Idol\" on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series. The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a debut Spanish album and the highest digital sales.\n\nIn September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film \"El Cantante\", which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe's wife Puchi. Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film \"El Cantante\" should have earned her an Oscar. \"I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in 'El Cantante,' but I don't think the academy members saw it\". \"El Cantante\" did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million. Lopez performed the song \"Toma de Mí\" for the film's soundtrack. Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28. Lopez's sixth studio album \"Brave\", released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide. The album produced two singles, \"Do It Well\" and \"Hold It Don't Drop It\". The first peaked at number 31 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, \"\", based on the lyrics of \"Como Ama una Mujer\" aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008. In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, \"Love?\" (\"Louboutins\" and \"Fresh Out of the Oven\"); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the \"Billboard\" charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.\n\nLopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album \"Love?\" under a new label. Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009. Upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album. The \"New York Daily News\" revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album. In April, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy \"The Back-up Plan\", her first theatrical role in three years. In June, following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from \"American Idol\", it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten's judging panel. During this same time, Lopez and Anthony were being considered for a role on \"The X Factor\" for their appeal to Latin and International markets. It was officially announced in September that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of \"American Idol\". MTV stated that the deal was \"mutually beneficial to all those involved\", while CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career, while \"American Idol\" producers believed that Lopez and Steven Tyler's appointments would strengthen viewing figures. In October, Lopez released her fourteenth fragrance, Love and Glamour. The perfume was inspired by Lopez's forthcoming \"return to the spotlight\".\n\nL'Oréal Paris named Lopez their new Global Ambassador and the face of their brands, including EverPure hair care, Preference hair color and Youth Code skin care. Her EverSleek hair care ads made their debut in early 2011, to coincide with the release of \"Love?\" and her debut as a judge on \"American Idol\". To further promote her comeback, in February, Venus chose Lopez as their new Global Ambassador. Lopez's comeback single \"On the Floor\" was released later that same month. The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year. The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since \"Jenny from the Block\". \"Love?\", which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over. Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez's most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million. In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl's with Tommy Hilfiger. In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage. Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio. Olivier Francois, the Chrysler chief marketing officer, stated that she \"fits perfectly with the brand\".\n\nIn January 2012, Lopez returned as a judge on the eleventh season of \"American Idol\", earning a reported $20 million. Later that same month, a new talent show, \"¡Q'Viva! The Chosen\", created by Simon Fuller premiered on Univision and was a hit for the channel. It followed Lopez, Anthony and director-choreographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent for a Las Vegas show. On May 18, Lopez returned to the big screen starring alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison and Dennis Quaid in the film \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\", which is based on the novel of the same name. In late May, Lopez released her fragrance Glowing by JLo, which she described as an \"evolution\" of Glow by JLo.\n\nLopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on June 14. It was a lucrative, grossing over $1 million per show. On July 12, she launched Teeology, a luxury T-shirt e-commerce. Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, \"\", the fourth film in the \"Ice Age\" franchise. The film became her highest opening weekend figure, at $46 million.\n\nLopez's first greatest hits album, \"Dance Again... the Hits\", was released on July 24, 2012 in the United States. It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label. Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Anthony and the \"breakup of a family\", felt as if the album's sole single, \"Dance Again\", had come to her at the \"perfect moment\". \"Dance Again\" and \"Goin' In\", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film \"Step Up Revolution\", both reached the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively. nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.\n\nIn January 2013, Lopez starred alongside Jason Statham in the crime thriller \"Parker\", in which she played Leslie. Her performance earned positive reviews, with \"Chicago Tribune\" commending the role for giving Lopez \"an opportunity to be dramatic, romantic, funny, depressed, euphoric and violent. The audience stays with her all the way\". The following month, she gained widespread notoriety for wearing a daring black dress at the Grammy Awards, which revealed her entire right leg; despite a conservative dress code which had been issued to celebrities in attendance. In May, Lopez was announced as the chief creative officer of nuvoTV. In addition, she founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, which is catered specifically for Latinos. She lobbied for more Hispanic diversity on television, hoping to empower the Latin community in these media ventures, stating: \"There's a big revolution going on, it's like a media and cultural revolution of Latinos here in the United States. We're realizing our power. We're realizing that we matter here.\" Inspired by her gay aunt who had recently died, Lopez signed on as executive producer of the television series \"The Fosters\", which is about a same-sex couple raising a family. The show premiered on ABC Family on June 3, 2013, and has since been a ratings success for the network. Later that June, Lopez performed at the birthday of Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov. Doing so, she garnered widespread backlash for performing for the leader of a \"repressive, authoritarian regime\". Her publicist released an apology. Lopez returned as judge on \"American Idol\" for its thirteenth season for a reported salary of $17.5 million. She was ranked as the fifth highest-paid woman in music for 2013, having earned $45 million.\n\nAfter the conclusion of her Dance Again World Tour, Lopez began recording her eighth studio album, \"A.K.A.\", inspired by her travels. It was released in June 2014 through Capitol Records, experiencing lackluster sales. The album produced three singles: \"I Luh Ya Papi\", which features French Montana, \"First Love\", and \"Booty\", featuring Pitbull or rapper Iggy Azalea. \"Booty\" debuted inside the top twenty in the United States, making it her second-highest debut on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 after \"On the Floor\". In April, the official song for the 2014 FIFA World Cup performed by Pitbull, Lopez and Brazilian recording artist Claudia Leitte, \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\", was released. She was ranked as the sixth highest-paid woman in music for the year, earning $37 million. In November 2014, Lopez partnered with Endless Jewelry, designing a range of new jewelry products. That month, she also released first her book, \"True Love\", which became a \"New York Times\" best-seller.\n\nJanuary 2015 saw the release of \"The Boy Next Door\", an erotic thriller that Lopez both co-produced and starred in as a high school teacher who becomes involved with a student, which eventually leads to his dangerous obsession with her. The film received negative reviews from critics. Despite this, it became her most successful opening at the box office for a live action film since \"Monster-in-Law\", and ultimately grossed over $53 million at the global box office, against a production budget of $4 million. Lopez had a voice role in the animated feature \"Home\", alongside Steve Martin, Jim Parsons, and Rihanna, and released in March 2015. She contributed the single \"Feel the Light\" to the film's official soundtrack. Lopez also starred in the independent drama film \"Lila & Eve\", alongside Viola Davis. With annual earnings of $28.5 million, she was ranked as the seventh highest-paid woman in music for 2015.\n\nLopez starred as Detective Harlee Santos in NBC's crime drama series \"Shades of Blue\" (also serving as an executive producer), a single mother and police detective who goes undercover for the FBI to investigate her own squad. It premiered on January 7, 2016, giving the network its most-watched Thursday debut in seven years with 8.6 million viewers. Lopez's performance received positive reviews. \"Shades of Blue\" was renewed for a second season, which premiered in March 2017. That same month, the series was renewed for a third season. In May 2015, she announced her Las Vegas residency concert show, which commenced on January 20, 2016, the first of twenty initial dates. Titled All I Have, it takes place at Planet Hollywood's Zappos Theater. The residency has been lucrative, and Lopez signed a three-year contract which saw her perform 120 shows. The residency concluded on September 29, 2018, having grossed over $100 million in ticket sales during its three-year run. In March 2016, six years after announcing her departure, she announced her return to Epic Records, signing a multi-album deal with the label. Her first single since returning to Epic, \"Ain't Your Mama\", was released the following month. With earnings of $39.5 million, she was among the highest-paid female artists from June 2015 to June 2016. Lopez reprised her voice role as Shira in the animated film \"\", which was released in July 2016.\n\nIn collaboration with Giuseppe Zanotti, Lopez designed a capsule collection of shoes and jewelry. \"Giuseppe for Jennifer Lopez\" launched in January 2017. In July 2016, Lopez announced a new dance competition series entitled \"World of Dance\", for which she serves as an executive producer and judge. Created in partnership with World of Dance, the series was greenlit by NBC with a straight-to-series order for ten episodes. \"World of Dance\" premiered on May 30, 2017; with 9.7 million viewers, it became the most-watched premiere for a summer alternative series in nine years. According to \"Forbes\", Lopez was the eleventh highest-paid female celebrity between June 2016 and June 2017, with earnings of $38 million. Lopez had announced in October 2016 that she was working on a second full length Spanish album, which was set to be released through Sony Music Latin, with Marc Anthony serving as an executive producer. It was to be titled \"Por Primera Vez\", which translates to \"For the First Time\" in English. The album, which never materialized, produced two singles: \"Ni Tú Ni Yo\" (featuring Cuban reggaeton group Gente de Zona) and \"Amor, Amor, Amor\" featuring Wisin.\n\nIn April 2018, Lopez launched her limited-edition makeup collection in collaboration with Inglot Cosmetics. That month, she was named one of \"Time\"s 100 most influential people in the world, and released a new Spanish single, \"El Anillo\". The following month, she released a bilingual single titled \"Dinero\", featuring DJ Khaled and Cardi B. Later, Lopez made a cameo appearance in the music video of Maroon 5's \"Girls Like You\", with Cardi B. With earnings of $47 million between June 2017 and June 2018, \"Forbes\" listed Lopez as the sixth highest-paid woman in music. In December 2018, Lopez starred in the comedy film \"Second Act\", directed by Peter Segal; she also produced the film, and recorded the single \"Limitless\" for its soundtrack. \"Second Act\" earned mixed reviews from critics, but performed well at the box office, grossing over $72.2 million worldwide with a production budget of $16 million.\n\nIn February 2019, Lopez announced that she will be embarking on her first concert tour in nearly seven years to celebrate her upcoming 50th birthday. Titled It's My Party, the international tour ran from June to August, grossing an estimated $54.7 million from thirty-eight shows. In March, alongside her fiancé Alex Rodriguez, Lopez launched a collection of sunglasses with the brand Quay Australia. The following month, she premiered the single \"Medicine\" featuring French Montana, her first release through L.A. Reid's Hitco Entertainment label. \n\nLopez next starred in the film \"Hustlers\" (2019), for which she also served as an executive producer. Directed by Lorene Scafaria, the film is inspired by a true story, following a group of Manhattan strippers who con wealthy men. Lopez's portrayal of a veteran stripper in \"Hustlers\" garnered acclaim from critics, with some deeming it the best performance of her acting career. The film also gave Lopez her highest opening weekend at the box office for a live action film (grossing $33.2 million), and garnered her nominations for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globe Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and Critics' Choice Movie Awards. The success of \"Hustlers\", released in September 2019, has been regarded by various media outlets as a comeback for Lopez. Also that month, she launched her twenty-fifth fragrance, which is titled Promise.\n\nIn September 2019, it was announced that Lopez will co-headline the Super Bowl LIV halftime show alongside Shakira, which will take place on February 2, 2020, in Miami, Florida. She will next star in \"Marry Me\" opposite Owen Wilson for Universal Pictures. Lopez is attached to star as drug lord Griselda Blanco in \"The Godmother\" for STX Entertainment, which will focus on the \"rise and fall\" of Blanco. She will also serve as an executive producer for the film, which is currently in development.\n\nLopez's personal life has attracted widespread media attention. From February 22, 1997, to January 1998, she was married to Cuban waiter Ojani Noa. Since their brief marriage, Lopez has endured many legal troubles regarding her relationship with Noa. In April 2006, she sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement. The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from \"criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging\" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney. A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa's possession is presently running.\n\nWhile working on her first album, \"On the 6\", Lopez began dating record producer and rapper Sean Combs. On December 27, 1999, the couple was arrested along with two others in connection with a shooting outside a Times Square club. They were charged with criminal possession of a weapon as well as stolen property. Lopez was soon exonerated, having had nothing to do with the crime. However, Combs was charged and indicted by a Manhattan grand jury. After leaving Combs, Lopez developed a relationship with former back-up dancer Cris Judd, to whom she was married from September 29, 2001, to June 2002. Following her second divorce due to irreconcilable differences, she commenced a high-profile relationship with actor and director Ben Affleck, to whom she became engaged in November 2002. The media began to refer to them as \"Bennifer\", and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable, as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names. The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media's interference with the event as the reason.\n\nLopez's break-up with Affleck in January 2004 was her \"first real heartbreak\". She described her next relationship, with her longtime friend, Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz), as an attempt to \"find someone who could make me feel loved and wanted in my loneliest hour ... Thinking back, maybe deep down I knew that this was a Band-Aid on the cut.\" She married Anthony that June, and lived in Brookville, New York. Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property. On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child. The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy. Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: \"My sister also had twins, so it's a hereditary thing.\" Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.\n\nLopez gave birth to a son and a daughter on Long Island, on February 22, 2008. The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of \"People\", for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time. Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012. Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children. On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony's last name (Muñiz).\n\nLopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.\n\nIn February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez. In March 2019, they announced their engagement.\n\nIn March 2018, Lopez opened up about her own Me Too movement story of being sexually harassed by a director early on in her career, when she was asked to take her top off during one of her first films. Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time's Up movement.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as \"What's Going On\" and \"El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)\", which benefited people affected by the tragedy. One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony's co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children. In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film \"Bordertown\", which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as \"one of the world's most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.\"\n\nIn 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.\n\nIn December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City. In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children's Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled \"Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are\". That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation. This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women. In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez announced that she would be donating $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico. Along with ex-husband Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria. Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, \"One Voice: Somos Live!\", which raised over $35 million. She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda's charity single \"Almost Like Praying\" which benefits Puerto Rico.\n\nLopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research. In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work. That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community. The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award. In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled \"Love Make the World Go Round\", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. She was also featured on the song \"Hands\" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting. Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from \"Billboard\" magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.\n\nLopez endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris. She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.\n\nLopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand. Growing up, she was influenced by Latin music styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song \"Rapper's Delight\" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life. She was also \"hugely inspired in her youth\" by Rita Moreno's performance in the 1961 musical film \"West Side Story\". Lopez has cited Janet Jackson as a major inspiration for her own dance and videos, stating that she \"probably started dancing\" because of Jackson's music video for \"The Pleasure Principle\".\n\nAccording to author Ed Morales in \"The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond\" (2003), Lopez's music explores the \"romantic innocence\" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop. Her debut album \"On the 6\" fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as \"state-of-the-art dance pop\". Dee Lockett, writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", stated that songs such as \"Waiting for Tonight\" made Lopez \"arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time\". While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song \"Let's Get Loud\". She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song \"Cariño\", for her second album \"J.Lo\". A departure from her previous albums, \"This Is Me... Then\" blends 1970s soul with \"streetwise\" hip hop.\n\nDescribed as autobiographical, much of Lopez's music has centered around the \"ups and downs\" of love. The lyrical content of \"This Is Me... Then\" is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song \"Dear Ben\" being described as the album's \"glowing centerpiece\". Her first full length Spanish-language album, \"Como Ama una Mujer\" features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing. When explaining her seventh studio album \"Love?\", Lopez stated: \"There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.\" Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx and women's empowerment.\n\nCritics have considered Lopez's voice to be limited, and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining \"radio-friendly\". Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" observed: \"Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.\" Meanwhile, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice \"slight\" and wrote: \"Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark \"husky-voiced voluptuousness\" she has in her films. J. D. Considine of \"The Baltimore Sun\" regards Lopez as having a \"breathy\" stylistic range, but lacking personality.\n\nConsidered one of dance's \"greatest success stories\", \"Refinery29\" ranked Lopez at number two on \"11 Of Pop's Most Iconic Dancers\" in 2015. Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco. Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\", where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as the Fly Girls. Since beginning her music career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines. Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including \"Jenny from the Block\", \"Dance Again\" and \"Booty\". Her provocatively choreographed music video for \"If You Had My Love\" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide. Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: \"Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century\", with \"Rolling Stone\" writer Brittany Spanos observing that her \"dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium's pop canon.\"\n\nOn stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal, and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance. Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in \"Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom\" (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who \"used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies\". Troy Patterson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, \"She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.\" Her signature movements include \"clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations\". While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously. In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is \"undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show\".\n\nLopez's provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series \"Britain's Got Talent\" was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom. Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it \"indecent\" and \"disgraceful\", while an education group claimed that she \"disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect\".\n\nSpeaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of \"Variety\" observed: \"Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles \"I'm Real\" and \"Jenny From the Block\". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's not asking you to come hither.\" In 2002, Lynette Holloway of \"The New York Times\" described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: \"Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere.\" Holloway noted her image to be \"a dash of \"ghetto fabulousness\"\" and \"middle-class respectability\" for mass appeal. \"Entertainment Weekly\" observed a change in her public profile upon joining \"American Idol\" in 2011, writing: \"Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth \"\".\" Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a \"showbiz phenomenon\".\n\nLopez is widely celebrated for her callipygian figure, which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot's 1992 hit \"Baby Got Back\". She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image. In \"Latin Sensations\" (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: \"Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.\" \"Vanity Fair\" described her buttocks as \"in and of themselves, a cultural icon\". \"Details\" magazine named Lopez the \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" in 1998, and she led \"FHM\"s \"100 Sexiest Women\" list twice. In 2011, she was named \"The Most Beautiful Woman\" by \"People\". The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of \"100 Sexiest Artists\", while \"Vibe\" magazine named her the most \"lustable\" celebrity of the past twenty years. In 2014, Lopez stated, \"There's this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy (...) It's the craziest thing I've ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.\"\n\nLopez is a tabloid fixture and has admitted to having a \"less-than-perfect\" public image. The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships. In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a \"modern-day Liz Taylor\" by the media. Lynn Hirschberg of \"W\" compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor. Her style is described by \"Billboard\"s Lauren Savage as scantily clad. Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits. She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding \"diva\", but she denies this. In 2003, \"The Observer\" remarked that Lopez was \"the woman immortalised in a million headlines as 'Hollywood's most demanding diva' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.\"\n\nLopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry. In 1999, \"The Record\" newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a \"whites-only preserve\" for much of its history. Described as a \"multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse\", Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history. Miriam Jiménez Román stated in \"The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States\" (2009) that \"[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries\". In 2012, business magazine \"Forbes\" suggested that Lopez \"may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet\", and named her \"the world's most powerful Latino celebrity\".\n\nUpon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the \"Latin explosion\" occurring in entertainment at the time. Writing for The Recording Academy, Brian Haack described her as the \"breakout female star\" of the Latin pop movement in American music. She was featured on the cover of the first issue of \"Latina\" magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating in 2011 that there is \"no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer\". Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez's curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States. In August 2005, \"Time\" listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: \"Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she's known by two syllables.\" In February 2007, \"People en Español\" named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer. In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, \"Litarachna lopezae\", after Lopez.\n\nLopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer. VH1 ranked her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music, and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era. Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Jessica Alba, Adrienne Bailon, Kat DeLuna, Mike Doughty, Fifth Harmony,  Becky G, Selena Gomez,  Ryan Guzman, Kelly Key, Q'orianka Kilcher, Demi Lovato, Normani, Pitbull, Francia Raisa, Cierra Ramirez Naya Rivera, Bebe Rexha, Rosa Salazar, Gwen Stefani, Stooshe, and Kerry Washington.\n\nFamed for her distinct style and fashion sense, \"Us Weekly\" named Lopez \"Style Icon\" of the 2000s decade. In 2019, the Council of Fashion Designers of America presented her with its Fashion Icon Award for her \"long-standing and global impact on fashion\". The Green Versace \"Jungle Dress\" that Lopez wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by \"The Daily Telegraph\". The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search. Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion . Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, has been credited with influencing the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s, with perfume critic Chandler Burr stating: \"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive.\" Following the success of Lopez's appointment as a judge on \"American Idol\" in 2010, a trend of networks hiring \"big names\" for judging panels on reality shows ensued. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" branded this \"The J.Lo Effect\".\n\n, Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, including 40 million albums, and her films have grossed a cumulative total of . She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States.\nWith her second studio album \"J.Lo\" (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953. Her album \"J to tha L-O! The Remixes\" was acknowledged by the \"Guinness World Records\" as the first number one remix album in the United States. In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts. Lopez's return to prominence the following year with her single \"On the Floor\"—among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video recognized as the \"Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time\" by \"Guinness World Records\" in 2012—is regarded as one of the greatest musical comebacks in history. In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions, and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud. In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award. \"Billboard\" magazine ranked her as the ninth greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016. In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award. In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to claim the prize since its introduction in 1984. \n\nBULLET::::- \"On the 6\" (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"J.Lo\" (2001)\nBULLET::::- \"This Is Me...

{"id": "16182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16182", "title": "Jock Taylor", "text": "Jock Taylor\n\nJock Taylor (9 March 1954 – 15 August 1982) was a Scottish World Champion motorcycle sidecar racer.\n\nJohn Robert (Jock) Taylor was born in Pencaitland, East Lothian, and entered his first sidecar race at the age of 19, as the passenger to Kenny Andrews (1974). The following year he took part in his first race as a driver. Taylor died in Finland as a consequence of a racing incident in 1982.\n\nTaylor was the Scottish Sidecar Champion with passenger Lewis Ward in 1977. He won races at East Fortune near Haddington, Beveridge Park in Kirkcaldy and at Knockhill near Dunfermline as well events in England with some success. In 1978 he decided to tackle the odd Grand Prix race and the British Championships and parted company with Ward and teamed up with a new passenger from nearby Haddington called Jimmy Neil. It took some time for the new partnership to gel but by the end of the season they were regularly winning races in England. In 1979 Taylor acquired a Seymaz hub centre steering type outfit and found it not to his liking after two accidents that left Jimmy Neil with a fractured wrist and caused the death of stand-in passenger Dave Powell at Oulton Park in a high-speed crash. With Neil still injured, Taylor used veteran passenger Jimmy Law for the German GP at Hockenheim on his old Windle framed Yamaha where they finished fifth. Although Neil returned at Assen in Holland, it was when he teamed up with former Swedish 125 cc rider Benga Johansson that Taylor took his first Grand Prix victory at the Swedish TT at Karlskoga shortly after. There were further successes towards the end of 1979 in Britain where he finished runner-up in the British Championship behind Dick Greasley. In 1980, Taylor and Benga Johansson won 4 Grand Prix races, and finished on the podium in all seven events they finished. He won the British Championship and won the Isle of Man Sidecar B race to win the Sidecar TT overall. In 1981 he retained his British title and he went on to become a four-time TT race winner. In 1982 Taylor and Johansson raised the sidecar lap record at the Isle of Man TT to 108.29 mph (ca. 175 km/h), a lap record which stood for 7 years.\n\nIn the 1982 Finnish Grand Prix, held in Imatra under very wet conditions, Taylor and Johansson's bike aquaplaned and slid off the road and collided with a telephone pole along the closed public road course that was used once a year for the Finnish GP. The emergency services were removing him from the wreckage when a second sidecar team slid off into them. Taylor was sadly killed in the second accident. He was buried in the local cemetery at Pencaitland, and a memorial to him has been erected in the village in December 2006. A memorial also stands in Beveridge Park, Kirkcaldy, overlooking Railway Bend on the old motorcycle racing circuit. Jock Taylor has also a memorial in Imatra, near the paddock of Finnish championship racetrack.\n\nJock's World championship, and TT 108.29 mph lap record-winning sidecar was bought by friend and fellow competitor Jack Muldoon from Jock's sponsor Dennis Trollope. Jack rescued Jock's outfit from the 5-man consortium who were supposed to restore the bike to its original condition and display it in a museum in Alford, Aberdeenshire. That never happened in the four years that it lay up in Alford in bits in a shed.\n\nJack Muldoon and family bought Jock's bike in March 2012 and started the restoration work immediately. The sidecar was completely stripped to a bare chassis, with months spent with emery cleaning and polishing the chassis. Due to the 26 years it lay at Donington in the museum and then 4 years up in Aberdeen, the chassis and all components were covered in rust and everything was seized: every component on the bike had to be stripped and cleaned, all bearings in all parts of the chassis were replaced, and the engine was completely rebuilt. It was done with the help of Bill Howarth and Dennis Trollope for all the Yamaha TZ700 parts required in the engine rebuild; Terry Windle, Stuart Mellor, Lockheed, HEL Performance Brake Pipes, Paul Drake Koni Shockers, Yolst Silkoline Oils. By August the restoration was 90% complete - it was the first time in 30 years that the TZ700 engine had run, and it was paraded at the Jock Taylor Memorial race weekend at East Fortune near Edinburgh in August 2012, a few miles from where Jock was born and brought up.\n\nIn the year following his death an annual end of season race was established at Knockhill called the Jock Taylor Trophy and it has always attracted the very best crews. Every year sidecar racers travel from all over the UK to race in what has become a prestigious race. In 2012, the race was held at East Fortune where Taylor started his racing career nearly 40 years ago.\n\nBULLET::::- Taylor's Rider Profile on the official Isle of Man TT website\nBULLET::::- BBC News article on unveiling of memorial, December 2006\n"}
{"id": "16186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16186", "title": "Homosexuality and Judaism", "text": "Homosexuality and Judaism\n\nThe subject of homosexuality and Judaism dates back to the Torah. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a \"to'eivah\" (something abhorred or detested) that can be subject to capital punishment by the currently non-existent Sanhedrin under \"halakha\" (Jewish law).\n\nThe issue has been a subject of contention within modern Jewish denominations, and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood homosexual male \"intercourse\" as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by Orthodox Judaism. On the other hand, Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not hold this view, and allow homosexual intercourse and same-sex marriage. Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which until December 2006 held the same position as Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of pluralism, with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing its view of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.\n\nAllen Bennett became the first openly gay rabbi in the United States in 1978. Lionel Blue was the first British rabbi to publicly declare himself as gay, which he did in 1980.\n\nThe Book of Leviticus refers to male homosexual sexual practices twice (JPS):\n\n.וְאֶת-זָכָר, לֹא תִשְׁכַּב מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה הִוא <br>\n\"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is detestable.\" <br> \n- Lev. 18:22\n\n.וְאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יִשְׁכַּב אֶת-זָכָר מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה עָשׂוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם. מוֹת יוּמָתוּ; דְּמֵיהֶם בָּם <br>\n\"And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed a detestable act: They shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\" <br> \n- Lev. 20:13\n\nDeuteronomy 23:17 tells followers: \"None of the daughters of Israel shall be a kedeshah, nor shall any of the sons of Israel be a Kadesh.\" This has been interpreted as prohibiting the \"sons of Israel\" from serving as a homosexual temple prostitute.\n\nThe story of Ruth and Naomi in the \"Book of Ruth\" is also occasionally interpreted as the story of a lesbian couple, while the biblical description of the relationship between David and Jonathan in the \"Book of Kings\" is sometimes interpreted as male homosexual love.\n\nLike many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation was the death penalty, though minors under 13 years of age were exempt from this, as from any other penalty (Sanh. 54a). However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. The Jewish Oral Law states that capital punishment would be applicable only if two men were caught in the act of anal sex, if there were two witnesses to the act, if the men involved were warned that they committed a capital offense, and the two men — or the willing party, in case of rape — subsequently acknowledged the warning, but continued to engage in the prohibited act anyway. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.\n\nRabbinic tradition understands the Torah's system of capital punishment to not be in effect for the past approximately 2,000 years, in the absence of a Sanhedrin and Temple.\n\nClassical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual \"attraction\" is inherently sinful. However, someone who has had homosexual \"intercourse\" is considered to have violated a prohibition. If he does teshuva (repentance), i. e., he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions, he is seen to be forgiven by God.\n\nWhy lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible has become a matter of interpretation. Suggestions range from the idea that in ancient times, only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times, sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women.\n\nSexual liaisons between women are, however, viewed as forbidden by Orthodox rabbis. This view is based on a Drash interpretation of the Biblical verse, \"Do not follow the ways of Egypt, where you once lived, nor of Canaan, where I will be bringing you. Do not follow any of their customs.\" (Leviticus 18:3).\n\nThe Talmud prohibits any activity which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together). The main concern in the Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry a member of the priesthood. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin, or made them a harlot. Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation, rather than the death penalty.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to same-sex marriage: \"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they don't sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'\"\n\nThe Midrash Rabba states: \"Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Joseph [said]: \"The generation of the flood was not obliterated from the world until they wrote marriage contracts from males and beasts.\"\"\n\nThe \"Pesikta Zutrasa\" interprets the reason for the prohibition in Leviticus against (male) homosexuality in terms of homosexuality being non-procreative. Nachmanides and the author of the \"Sefer Hachinuch\" similarly follow this interpretation.\n\nThe Tosafot, the Rosh and the Ran understand the reason for the prohibition as that as a result of (male) homosexuality, a man abandons his wife to pursue a homosexual relation.\n\nWhile a variety of views regarding homosexuality as an inclination or status exist within the Orthodox Jewish community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is some disagreement about which male homosexual acts come under core prohibitions, the majority of Orthodox Judaism puts male-male anal sex in the category of \"yehareg ve'al ya'avor\", \"die rather than transgress\", the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law to die rather than do. Similarly, some consider lesbianism a martyrdom-demanding transgression if only based upon the principle of \"abizrayhu\" (corollary prohibitions of the more severe martyrdom-requiring prohibitions). According to the Talmud, homosexual acts are forbidden between non-Jews as well, and this is included among the sexual restrictions of the Noachide laws. The archetypal model in Judaism is marital heterosexuality with celibacy, fornication, incest, bestiality and homosexuality seen to be part of a continuous prism of wrong.\n\nIn a speech given in 1986, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, discussed \"individuals who express an inclination towards a particular form of physical relationship in which the libidinal gratification is sought with members of one's own gender\". He wrote that \"society and government must be to offer a helping hand to those who are afflicted with this problem\".\n\nRabbi Dr. Immanuel Jakobovits, in his entry \"Homosexuality\" in the \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" (Keter Publishing), describes the traditional opinion on homosexuality in this way: \"Jewish law [...] rejects the view that homosexuality is to be regarded merely as a disease or as morally neutral... Jewish law holds that no hedonistic ethic, even if called \"love\", can justify the morality of homosexuality any more than it can legitimize adultery or incest, however genuinely such acts may be performed out of love and by mutual consent.\" Rabbi Norman Lamm (the Chancellor, \"Rosh Yeshiva\" [\"head of the yeshiva\"], and former president of Yeshiva University, a major Modern Orthodox Jewish institution) advocated that some (although not all) homosexuals should be viewed as diseased and in need of compassion and treatment, rather than willful rebels who should be ostracized. He distinguishes between six varieties of homosexuals, including \"genuine homosexuals\" who have \"strong preferential erotic feelings for members of the same sex\", \"transitory\" and \"situational\" homosexuals who would prefer heterosexual intercourse but are denied it or seek gain in homosexuality, and heterosexuals who are merely curious.\n\nWhen Steven Greenberg, who received Orthodox rabbinic ordination, publicly announced in 1999 that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in the Jewish newspapers. Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University, stated, \"It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society.\" As Greenberg has a rabbinic ordination from the Orthodox rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University (RIETS), he is generally described as the first openly gay Orthodox Jewish rabbi. However, some Orthodox Jews, including many rabbis, dispute his being an Orthodox rabbi.\n\nOrthodox Israeli rabbi Ron Yosef became in 2009 the first Israeli Orthodox Rabbi to come out, by appearing in Uvda (\"Fact\"), Israel's leading investigative television program, in an episode regarding conversion therapies in Israel. Yosef remains in his position as a pulpit Rabbi. Yosef testified that his Yemenite congregation did not accept him being a homosexual very easily and it took them a while to accept it.Yosef received death threats in the year leading up to the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting. In 2013, he stated he is in a relationship with a man. Yosef has stated his approach to the issue of homosexuality in Judaism as follows: \"It is clear to me that lying with another man is forbidden, and our starting point is commitment to halacha and Torah. The goal is not to seek permission. But you need to give us a shoulder and support.\"\n\nIn 2019 Daniel Atwood became the first openly gay open Orthodox person to be ordained as a Open Orthodox rabbi; he was ordained by the rabbi Daniel Landes, in Jerusalem.Modern Orthodox and Ultra Orthodox Jews don't accept Open Orthodox Judaism as a part of Orthodox Judaism.\n\nIn an open letter distributed to Orthodox community leaders, the Hod organization appealed to the Orthodox community to recognize them as part of the religious society. This was sent to over 100 rabbis in 2008, and eventually was known as the \"Document of Principles\". In part, the document states:\n\nUp to 2013, 163 Orthodox rabbis from Israel and abroad have signed this statement, among them: rabbi Yuval Cherlow, rabbi Binyamin Lau, rabbi Haim Navon, rabbi Daniel Sperber, rabbi Eliezer Melamed, rabbi Shai Piron, and rabbi Yehuda Gilad.\n\nIn 2010, TorahWeb.org published a brief position statement entitled \"Torah View on Homosexuality\". It was co-authored by Rav Hershel Schachter, Rav Mordechai Willig, Rav Michael Rosensweig, and Rav Mayer Twersky. These four are all roshei yeshiva (i. e., rabbinic leaders) at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University, the largest and most influential Modern Orthodox rabbinic program in America. In part, the statement reads:\n\nOn July 22, 2010, a \"Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community\" was released. It was written primarily by Nathaniel Helfgot, Aryeh Klapper, and Yitzchak Blau. Signatories include more than a hundred rabbis and laypeople. Some of the statement's more notable supporters are Rabbi Marc Angel, co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship; Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founder of Lincoln Square Synagogue, Efrat, and Ohr Torah Stone Institutions; and Rabbi Avi Weiss, head of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, founder of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah and Yeshivat Maharat, and co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship.\n\nThe statement affirms that homosexual sexual activity is prohibited, saying inter alia that \"Halakhah sees heterosexual marriage as the ideal model and sole legitimate outlet for human sexual expression\"; \"Halakhic Judaism views all male and female same-sex sexual interactions as prohibited\"; and \"halakhic values proscribe individuals and communities from encouraging practices that grant religious legitimacy to gay marriage and couplehood\". The statement emphasizes the community obligation to treat its gay friends, family, and community members with compassion and respect.\n\nSome of the statement's points that diverge from other common Orthodox positions are:\nBULLET::::- We affirm the religious right of those with a homosexual orientation to reject therapeutic approaches they reasonably see as useless or dangerous.\nBULLET::::- We believe that the decision as to whether to be open about one's sexual orientation should be left to such individuals, who should consider their own needs and those of the community. We are opposed on ethical and moral grounds to both the “outing” of individuals who want to remain private and to coercing those who desire to be open about their orientation to keep it hidden.\nBULLET::::- Communities should display sensitivity, acceptance and full embrace of the adopted or biological children of homosexually active Jews in the synagogue and school setting.\nBULLET::::- Jews who have an exclusively homosexual orientation should, under most circumstances, not be encouraged to marry someone of the other gender.\n\nAn edict signed by dozens of Israeli Orthodox rabbis and published in 2016 by the Israeli Modern Orthodox rabbinic group Beit Hillel, a group which promotes inclusiveness in Orthodox Judaism, stated, in part, \"According to the Torah and halacha, the [same-sex sexual] acts are forbidden, but not the proclivities, and therefore, people with same-sex tendencies, men and women, have no invalidation in halacha or tradition. They are obligated by the commandments of the Torah, they can fulfill a [ritual] obligation on behalf of the public, and carry out all of the community functions just like any member.\" It also stated, in part, \"Just as it [is] inconceivable to mock someone for being physically, behaviorally, or mentally different, so too those with same-sex tendencies should not be mocked. On the contrary, those around them — family and community — should show special feeling for them, and apply to them the Torah commandment of 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' and to be diligent in avoiding the prohibition of insulting another.\"\n\nJONAH was a Jewish ex-gay organization that focuses on \"prevention, intervention, and healing of the underlying issues causing same-sex attractions\". In 2012, four former clients of JONAH sued the organization for fraud, claiming that it sold them therapies that were ineffective and counterproductive. Soon after in that same year, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), a professional association of more than 1,000 Orthodox rabbis around the world, sent an open email to its members that it no longer supported reparative therapy generally, or JONAH specifically. In 2015, a New Jersey jury found JONAH guilty of consumer fraud for promising to be able to change its clients' sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable. As part of the sentence, JONAH was required to cease all operations, but continues to operate under the name JIFGA as of 2018.\n\nUK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote the foreword to Rabbi Chaim Rapoport's book \"Judaism and Homosexuality: An Authentic Orthodox View\". In the foreword, Rabbi Sacks has written: \"Compassion, sympathy, empathy, understanding - these are essential elements of Judaism. They are what homosexual Jews who care about Judaism need from us today.\"\n\nModern Orthodox leader Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein is reported to have said that the intensity of Orthodox community's condemnation of homosexuality goes beyond what its status as a religious transgression warrants, and that he feels toward homosexual people \"criticism, disapproval, but tempered with an element of sympathy\".\n\nIn both the United States and in Israel several groups have sprung up in the last few years that seek to support those who identify as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBT children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women's group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod (\"Majesty\"). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBT people with whom to share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.\n\nOrthodox rabbis Shmuley Boteach and Zev Farber have questioned the opposition of orthodox groups to government recognition of same-sex civil marriages, arguing that although Judaism does not condone homosexuality, governments should not enforce any particular religion's view of marriage, and that conferring civil benefits to committed homosexual couples should be viewed as promoting family values. Orthodox Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.\n\nIn November 2016, dozens of LGBT activists protested in Jerusalem against comments reportedly made by the city's chief rabbi Rabbi Shlomo Amar, who reportedly told an Israeli newspaper that gay people were an \"abomination\", and homosexuality a \"cult\".\n\nIn 2017, the Senior Rabbi of the Spanish & Portuguese Sephardi Community Joseph Dweck gave a class describing \"the entire revolution of feminism and even homosexuality in our society ... is a fantastic development for humanity\". These words were condemned by Rabbi Aaron Bassous as \"false and misguided ... corrupt from beginning to end\". This affair caused Dweck to step down from the Sephardic Beth Din but not as a communal leader.\n\nIn 2019, Rabbi Daniel Landes wrote, \"Leviticus 18:22 ... has not been erased from the Torah. But that biblical commandment does not give us license to ignore or abuse the significant number of carefully observant Jews who are LGBTQ.\"\n\nAs a matter of both Jewish law and institutional policy, Conservative (\"Masorti\") Judaism has wrestled with homosexuality issues since the 1980s.\n\nConservative Jewish writer Herschell Matt initially argued that homosexuals may be excused because Judaism does recognise 'constraint' as a valid excuse to disobey the law. However, Matt later shifted to outright support for homosexuality, viewing it as part of the natural order. Conservative Rabbi Robert Kirshchner states that Jews have historically adapted their laws to new circumstances, indicating accommodation for homosexuality.\nIn Conservative Judaism, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly makes the movement's decisions concerning Jewish law. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement.\n\nIn 2006, the CJLS shifted its position and paved the way for significant changes regarding the Conservative movement's policies toward homosexuality. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three distinct responsa reflecting very different approaches to the subject. One responsum substantially liberalized Conservative Judaism's approach including lifting most (but not all) classical prohibitions on homosexual conduct and permitted the blessing of homosexual unions and the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. Two others completely retained traditional prohibitions. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, the adoption of multiple opinions permits individual Conservative rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to select which opinion to accept, and hence to choose individually whether to maintain a traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, or to permit openly gay/lesbian/bisexual unions and clergy.\n\nThe liberalizing responsum, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 of 25 votes, was authored by Rabbis Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. It lifted most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opened the way to the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbis and cantors and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopped short of religiously recognizing same-sex marriage. The responsum invoked the Talmudic principle of \"kavod habriyot\", which the authors translated as \"human dignity\", as authority for this approach. The responsum maintained a prohibition on male-male anal sex, which it described as the sole Biblically prohibited homosexual act. This act remains a \"yehareg ve'al ya'avor\" (\"die rather than transgress\" offense) under the decision.\n\nTwo traditionalist responsa were adopted. A responsum by Rabbi Joel Roth, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 votes, reaffirmed a general complete prohibition on homosexual conduct. A second responsum by Rabbi Leonard Levy, adopted as a minority opinion by 6 votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.\n\nThe Committee rejected a fourth paper by Gordon Tucker which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual sexual practices.\n\nThe consequences of the decision have been mixed. On the one hand, four members of the Committee - Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Joseph Prouser - resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change. On the other hand, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it will immediately begin admitting gay/lesbian/bisexual students as soon as the law committee passes a policy that sanctions such ordination. On March 26, 2007, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay/lesbian/bisexual candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program.\n\nIn June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13–0 vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Masorti synagogues in Europe and Israel, which have historically been somewhat more traditional than the American movement, continue to maintain a complete ban on homosexual and bisexual conduct, clergy, and unions. As such, most Conservative rabbis outside the United States are exercising their authority as local rabbinic authorities (\"mara d'atra\") to reject the more liberal responsa. The head of the Israeli Masorti movement's Vaad Halakha (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi David Golinkin, wrote the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct. The Masorti movements in Argentina, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have indicated that they will not admit or ordain openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbinical students. The Masorti Movement's Israeli seminar also rejected a change in its view of the status of homosexual conduct, stating that, \"Jewish law has traditionally prohibited homosexuality\".\n\nRabbi Bradley Artson, Dean of the Rabbinic School at American Jewish University, claims to have studied every reference he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers. Every citation he found described an encounter between males where one party, the master, physically abused another, the slave. Rabbi Artson could not find a single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. \"Homosexual relationships today\", Rabbi Artson says, \"should not be compared to the ancient world. I know too many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships. I know too many same-sex couples that are loving parents raising good descent ethical children. Who's to say their family relationships are less sanctified in the eyes of God than mine is with my wife and our children?\"\n\nThe Reform Judaism movement, the largest branch of Judaism in North America, has rejected the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, they do not prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations, rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in light of what is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.\n\nIn 1972, Beth Chayim Chadashim, the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, was established in West Los Angeles, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.\n\nIn 1977, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), which is the Union for Reform Judaism's principal body, adopted a resolution calling for legislation decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults, and calling for an end to discrimination against gays and lesbians. The resolution called on Reform Jewish organizations to develop programs to implement this stand.\n\nReform rabbi Lionel Blue was the first British rabbi to publicly declare himself as gay, which he did in 1980.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the primary seminary of the Reform movement, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, changed its admission requirements to allow openly gay and lesbian people to join the student body.\n\nIn 1990, the Union for Reform Judaism announced a national policy declaring lesbian and gay Jews to be full and equal members of the religious community. Also in 1990, the CCAR officially endorsed a report of their own Ad Hoc Committee on Homosexuality and the Rabbinate. This position paper urged that \"all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation that they have chosen\". The committee endorsed the view that \"all Jews are religiously equal, regardless of their sexual orientation\".\n\nIn 1995, Reform Rabbi Margaret Wenig's essay \"Truly Welcoming Lesbian and Gay Jews\" was published in \"The Jewish Condition: Essays on Contemporary Judaism Honoring [Reform] Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler\"; it was the first published argument to the Jewish community on behalf of civil marriage for gay couples.\n\nIn 1996, the CCAR passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n\nIn 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on Human Sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community\". The report called for the CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy \"teshuvah\" (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\n\nIn March 2000, the CCAR issued a new resolution stating that, \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\n\nAlso in 2000, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion established the Institute for Judaism, Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity to \"educate HUC-JIR students on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues to help them challenge and eliminate homophobia and heterosexism; and to learn tools to be able to transform the communities they encounter into ones that are inclusive and welcoming of LGBT Jews\". It is the first and only institute of its kind in the Jewish world.\n\nIn 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, \"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities\".\n\nAlso in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the bisexual and transgender communities, and saying, \"Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and\nCalls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.\"\n\nIn 2009, \"Siddur Sha'ar Zahav\", the first complete prayer book to address the lives and needs of LGBTQ as well as straight Jews, was published. Publisher: J Levine Judaica & Sha'ar Zahav (2009); ; . Sha'ar Zahav is a progressive Reform synagogue in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2014, the CCAR joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, which is America's first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.\n\nIn 2015, Rabbi Denise Eger became the first openly gay president of the CCAR.\n\nAlso in 2015, the High Holy Days Reform Jewish prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah. Mishkan HaNefesh can be translated as \"sanctuary of the soul\". It replaces a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, \"Gates of Repentance\", that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line \"rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]\", and adds a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering \"mibeit\", Hebrew for \"from the house of\", in addition to the traditional \"son of\" or \"daughter of\". The Mishkan HaNefesh includes several sets of translations for the traditional prayers. Psalm 23 includes the familiar \"traditional\" translation, an adaptation that is considered \"gender-sensitive\" but remains faithful to the traditional version, a feminist adaption from Phyllis Appell Bass, and the fourth was published in 1978 by a contemporary rabbi.\n\nThe Reconstructionist movement sees homosexuality and bisexuality as normal expressions of sexuality and welcomes gays, bisexuals, and lesbians into Reconstructionist communities to participate fully in every aspect of community life. Since 1985, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College has admitted openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates to their rabbinical and cantorial programs. In 1993, a movement Commission issued: \"Homosexuality and Judaism: The Reconstructionist Position\". The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages/commitment ceremonies, though the RRA does not require its members to officiate at them. In 2007, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Toba Spitzer, the first openly LGBT person chosen to head a rabbinical association in the United States. In 2011 Sandra Lawson became the first openly gay African-American and first African-American admitted to the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College; she was ordained in June 2018, which made her the first openly gay, female, black rabbi in the world. In 2013, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Jason Klein, the first openly gay man chosen to head a national rabbinical association of one of the major Jewish denominations in the United States. Also in 2013, Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.\n\nJewish Renewal is a recent movement in Judaism which endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with Kabbalistic, Hasidic, musical and meditative practices; it describes itself as \"a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism's prophetic and mystical traditions\". The Jewish Renewal movement ordains people of all sexual orientations as rabbis and cantors. In 2005, Eli Cohen became the first openly gay rabbi ordained by the Jewish Renewal Movement, followed by Chaya Gusfield and Rabbi Lori Klein in 2006, who became the two first openly lesbian rabbis ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2007, Jalda Rebling, born in Amsterdam and now living in Germany, became the first openly lesbian cantor ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2011, the bisexual rights activist Debra Kolodny was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Renewal movement and hired as the rabbi for congregation P'nai Or of Portland. The Statement of Principles of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal (and OHALAH and the Rabbinic Pastors Association) states in part, \"We welcome and recognize the sanctity of every individual regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We recognize respectful and mutual expressions of adult human sexuality as potentially sacred expressions of love, and therefore, we strive to welcome a variety of constellations of intimate relationships and family forms including gay, lesbian, and heterosexual relationships as well as people choosing to be single.\" \n\nHumanistic Judaism is a movement in Judaism that offers a non-theistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. In 2004, the Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a resolution supporting \"the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex\", and affirming \"the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof\". In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying. The Association of Humanistic Rabbis has also issued a pro-LGBT statement titled \"In Support of Diverse Sexualities and Gender Identities\". It was adopted in 2003 and issued in 2004.\n\nJewish LGBT rights advocates and sympathetic clergy have created various institutions within Jewish life to accommodate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender parishioners. Beth Chayim Chadashim, established in 1972 in West Los Angeles, was the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines, including Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York City, Bet Mishpachah in Washington, D. C., and Congregation Or Chadash in Chicago. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.\n\nLGBT-inclusive services and ceremonies specific to Jewish religious culture have also been created, ranging from LGBT-affirmative haggadot for Passover to a \"Stonewall Shabbat Seder\".\n\nIn October 2012 Rainbow Jews, an oral history project showcasing the lives of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until the present, was launched. It is the United Kingdom's first archive of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender history.\n\nThe ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives has, among other things, the Twice Blessed Collection, circa 1966-2000; this collection \"consists of materials documenting the Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender experience, circa 1966-2000, collected by the Jewish Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Archives, founded and operated by Johnny Abush\".\n\nRecent research by the sociocultural psychologist, Chana Etengoff, has highlighted the therapeutic benefits of LGBTQ petitions to religious leaders, including meaning-making, social action, agency and empowerment.\n\nBULLET::::- Bat Kol Religious lesbian community in Israel\nBULLET::::- Bet Mishpachah: LGBT welcoming Jewish congregation in Washington, D.C.\nBULLET::::- \"Chicks in White Satin\": a 1994 American short documentary film about the Jewish same-sex marriage of two lesbians.\nBULLET::::- Eshel\nBULLET::::- Havruta Religious gay community in Israel\nBULLET::::- Judaism and sexuality\nBULLET::::- \"Keep Not Silent\": A documentary about Orthodox Jewish lesbians.\nBULLET::::- Keshet Rabbis\nBULLET::::- LGBT clergy in Judaism\nBULLET::::- LGBT matters and religion\nBULLET::::- LGBT rights in Israel\nBULLET::::- List of LGBT Jews\nBULLET::::- Mixed-orientation marriage: A marriage between partners of differing sexual orientations.\nBULLET::::- Same-sex marriage and Judaism\nBULLET::::- \"Say Amen\": A documentary about a gay man coming out to his Orthodox family\nBULLET::::- Tel Aviv Pride\nBULLET::::- Timeline of LGBT Jewish history\nBULLET::::- Touro University Gay-Straight Alliance: The GLBT student group for the largest Jewish sponsored university in the world.\nBULLET::::- Transgenderism and religion\nBULLET::::- Trembling Before G-d: a movie about Jews whose homosexuality is not accepted by Orthodox rabbis\nBULLET::::- Abomination (Judaism)\n\nBULLET::::- Alpert, Rebecca, \"Like Bread on a Seder Plate: Jewish Lesbians and the Transformation of Tradition\", Columbia University Press, New York, 1998.\nBULLET::::- Alpert, Rebecca, Sue Levi Elwell and Shirley Idelson (editors), \"Lesbian Rabbis: The First Generation\", Rutgers University Press, New Jersey, 2001.\nBULLET::::- Marc Angel, Hillel Goldberg, and Pinchas Stolper, \"Homosexuality and the Orthodox Jewish Community\" \"Jewish Action\" 53:2 p. 54 (1992).\nBULLET::::- Balka, Christie and Rose, Andy, \"Twice Blessed: on Being Lesbian or Gay and Jewish\" Boston: Beacon Press, 1989.\nBULLET::::- J.

{"id": "16187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16187", "title": "John Dewey", "text": "John Dewey\n\nJohn Dewey (; October 20, 1859 – June 1, 1952) was an American philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer whose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. He is regarded as one of the most prominent American scholars in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe overriding theme of Dewey's works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, \"Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous.\" Known for his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental elements—schools and civil society—to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed public opinion, accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.\n\nDewey was one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of pragmatism and is considered one of the fathers of functional psychology. His paper \"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology,\" published in 1896, is regarded as the first major work in the (Chicago) functionalist school. A \"Review of General Psychology\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.\n\nDewey was also a major educational reformer for the 20th century. A well-known public intellectual, he was a major voice of progressive education and liberalism. While a professor at the University of Chicago, he founded the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to apply and test his progressive ideas on pedagogical method. Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, art, logic, social theory, and ethics.\n\nJohn Dewey was born in Burlington, Vermont to a family of modest means. He was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey. Their second son was also named John, but he died in an accident on January 17, 1859. The second John Dewey was born October 20, 1859, forty weeks after the death of his older brother. Like his older, surviving brother, Davis Rich Dewey, he attended the University of Vermont, where he was initiated into Delta Psi, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1879. A significant professor of Dewey's at the University of Vermont was Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey (H. A. P. Torrey), the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president Joseph Torrey. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAfter two years as a high-school teacher in Oil City, Pennsylvania and one year as an elementary-school teacher in the small town of Charlotte, Vermont, Dewey decided that he was unsuited for teaching primary or secondary school. After studying with George Sylvester Morris, Charles Sanders Peirce, Herbert Baxter Adams, and G. Stanley Hall, Dewey received his Ph.D. from the School of Arts & Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the University of Michigan (1884–88 and 1889–94) with the help of George Sylvester Morris. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled \"The Psychology of Kant.\"\nIn 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded University of Chicago (1894–1904) where he developed his belief in Rational Empiricism, becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled \"Thought and its Subject-Matter\", which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title \"Studies in Logical Theory\" (1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, \"The School and Society\" (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the university, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the American Psychological Association (A.P.A.). From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at Columbia University. In 1905 he became president of the American Philosophical Association. He was a longtime member of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nAlong with the historians Charles A. Beard and James Harvey Robinson, and the economist Thorstein Veblen, Dewey is one of the founders of The New School. Dewey's most significant writings were \"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology\" (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; \"Democracy and Education\" (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; \"Human Nature and Conduct\" (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior; \"The Public and its Problems\" (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to Walter Lippmann's \"The Phantom Public\" (1925); \"Experience and Nature\" (1925), Dewey's most \"metaphysical\" statement; \"Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World\" (1929), a glowing travelogue from the nascent USSR; \"Art as Experience\" (1934), Dewey's major work on aesthetics; \"A Common Faith\" (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the Dwight H. Terry Lectureship at Yale; \"\" (1938), a statement of Dewey's unusual conception of logic; \"Freedom and Culture\" (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and \"Knowing and the Known\" (1949), a book written in conjunction with Arthur F. Bentley that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works (see Transactionalism). While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in most of what he published. He published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books.\n\nReflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, Hilda Neatby wrote \"Dewey has been to our age what Aristotle was to the later Middle Ages, not a philosopher, but \"the\" philosopher.\"\n\nDewey married Alice Chipman in 1886 shortly after Chipman graduated with her PhB from the University of Michigan. The two had six children: Frederick Archibald Dewey, Evelyn Riggs Dewey, Morris (who died young), Gordon Chipman Dewey, Lucy Alice Chipman Dewey, and Jane Mary Dewey. Alice Chipman died in 1927 at the age of 68; weakened by a case of malaria contracted during a trip to Turkey in 1924 and a heart attack during a trip to Mexico City in 1926, she died from cerebral thrombosis on July 13, 1927. Dewey married Estelle Roberta Lowitz Grant, \"a longtime friend and companion for several years before their marriage\" on December 11, 1946. At Roberta's behest, the couple adopted two siblings, Lewis (changed to John, Jr.) and Shirley. John Dewey died of pneumonia on June 1, 1952 at his home in New York City after years of ill-health. and was cremated the next day.\n\nThe United States Postal Service honored Dewey with a Prominent Americans series 30¢ postage stamp in 1968.\n\nIn 1919, Dewey and his wife traveled to Japan on sabbatical leave. Though Dewey and his wife were well received by the people of Japan during this trip, Dewey was also critical of the nation's governing system and claimed that the nation's path towards democracy was \"ambitious but weak in many respects in which her competitors are strong.\" He also stated that \"the real test has not yet come. But if the nominally democratic world should go back on the professions so profusely uttered during war days, the shock will be enormous, and bureaucracy and militarism might come back.\"\n\nDuring his trip to Japan, Dewey was invited by Peking University to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin. Dewey and his wife Alice arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919, just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in Shandong province to Japan. Their demonstrations on May Fourth excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.\n\nIn these two years, Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in \"The New Republic\" and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of Bolshevism to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shih. For these audiences, Dewey represented \"Mr. Democracy\" and \"Mr. Science,\" the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as \"Second Confucius\". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and Tao Xingzhi, who had studied at Teachers College, Columbia University.\n\nTheir letters from China and Japan describing their experiences to their family were published in 1920, edited by their daughter Evelyn. During and after his visit his commentaries on China would be published in such periodicals as the New Republic, Asia, the China Review, and sometimes in newspapers like the Baltimore Sun. Though discussing Chinese philosophy but rarely, one article in 1922, \"As the Chinese Think\", discusses the teachings of Laozi and Confucius in an attempt to improve understanding of the Chinese in international business relations.\n\nDewey and his daughter Jane went to South Africa in July 1934, at the invitation of the World Conference of New Education Fellowship in Cape Town and Johannesburg, where he delivered several talks. The conference was opened by the South African Minister of Education Jan Hofmeyr, and Deputy Prime Minister Jan Smuts. Other speakers at the conference included Max Eiselen and Hendrik Verwoerd, who would later become prime minister of the Nationalist government that introduced Apartheid. John and Jane's expenses were paid by the Carnegie Foundation. He also traveled to Durban, Pretoria and Victoria Falls in what was then Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and looked at schools, talked to pupils, and gave lectures to the administrators and teachers. In August 1934, Dewey accepted an honorary degree from the University of the Witwatersrand.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Dewey published his first two books, \"Psychology\" (1887), and \"Leibniz's New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding\" (1888), both of which expressed Dewey's early commitment to British neo-Hegelianism. In \"Psychology\", Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.\n\nWhile still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, James Hayden Tufts and George Herbert Mead, together with his student James Rowland Angell, all influenced strongly by the recent publication of William James' \"Principles of Psychology\" (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of Wilhelm Wundt and his followers.\n\nBy 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he would later write \"Ethics\" (1908) at the recently founded University of Chicago and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called \"Chicago group\" of psychology.\n\nTheir new style of psychology, later dubbed functional psychology, had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article \"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology\" which appeared in \"Psychological Review\" in 1896, he reasons against the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc in favor of a \"circular\" account in which what serves as \"stimulus\" and what as \"response\" depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.\n\nDewey was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.\n\nIn 1984, the American Psychological Association announced that Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1878–1972) had become the first psychologist to be commemorated on a United States postage stamp. However, psychologists Gary Brucato and John D. Hogan later made the case that this distinction actually belonged to John Dewey, who had been celebrated on an American stamp 17 years earlier. While some psychology historians consider Dewey more of a philosopher than a bona fide psychologist, the authors noted that Dewey was a founding member of the A.P.A., served as the A.P.A.'s eighth president in 1899, and was the author of an 1896 article on the reflex arc which is now considered a basis of American functional psychology.\n\nDewey also expressed interest in work in the psychology of visual perception performed by Dartmouth research professor Adelbert Ames Jr. He had great trouble with listening, however, because it is known Dewey could not distinguish musical pitches—in other words was tone deaf.\n\nDewey sometimes referred to his philosophy as instrumentalism rather than pragmatism, and would have recognized the similarity of these two schools to the newer school named consequentialism. He defined with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:\n\nHis concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in \"Knowing and the Known\" in 1949.\n\nThe terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley, to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation. In the order of chronological appearance, these are:\nBULLET::::- Self-Action: Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused their actions.\nBULLET::::- Interaction: as described by Newton, where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, the third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\nBULLET::::- Transaction: where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with multiple aspects and phases of action without any attribution to ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.\n\nA series of characterizations of Transactions indicate the wide range of considerations involved.\n\nDewey sees paradox in contemporary logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?\n\nLogical positivism also figured in Dewey's thought. About the movement he wrote that it \"eschews the use of 'propositions' and 'terms', substituting 'sentences' and 'words'.\" (\"General Theory of Propositions\", in \"Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\") He welcomes this changing of referents \"in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions.\" However, he registers a small complaint against the use of \"sentence\" and \"words\" in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition \"narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences.\"\nIn other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or \"adjudged only by means of context.\"\n\nYet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends. Concerning traditional logic, he states:\n\nLouis Menand argues in \"\" that Jane Addams had been critical of Dewey's emphasis on antagonism in the context of a discussion of the Pullman strike of 1894. In a later letter to his wife, Dewey confessed that Addams' argument was:\n\nHe went on to add:\n\nIn a letter to Addams, clearly influenced by his conversation with her, Dewey wrote:\n\n\"Art as Experience\" (1934) is Dewey's major writing on aesthetics.\n\nIt is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by Albert C. Barnes at the Barnes Foundation, whose own ideas on the application of art to one's way of life was influenced by Dewey's writing. Barnes was particularly influenced by \"Democracy and Education\" (1916) and then attended Dewey's seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.\n\nDewey founded the University of Chicago laboratory school, supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially Jane Addams' Hull House.\n\nThrough his work at the Hull House serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women's suffrage. Dewey experienced the lack of children's education while contributing in the classroom at the Hull House and the lack of education and skills of immigrant women. Stengel argues:\n\nHis leading views on democracy included: \n\nFirst, Dewey believed that democracy is an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making ... Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society. \n\nThis helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.\n\nDewey believed that a woman's place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, \"You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won't be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn't do\". John Dewey's support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams' Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew as well as the support for the women's suffrage movement.\n\nAs commonly argued by Dewey's greatest critics, he was not able to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women's suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. \"Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures\". With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.\n\nWith respect to technological developments in a democracy:\n\nHis work on democracy influenced B.R. Ambedkar, one of his students, who later became one of the founding fathers of independent India.\n\nDewey's educational theories were presented in \"My Pedagogic Creed\" (1897), \"The School and Society\" (1900), \"The Child and the Curriculum\" (1902), \"Democracy and Education\" (1916), \"Schools of To-morrow\" (c1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and \"Experience and Education\" (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.\n\nThe ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that \"to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities\" (\"My Pedagogic Creed\", Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that \"education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction\".\n\nIn addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In \"The Child and the Curriculum\" (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, \"the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened\" (1902, p. 13). He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.\n\nAt the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the \"child-centered\" excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, \"we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning\" (Dewey, 1902, pp. 13–14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.\n\nIn order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that \"the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction\" (Dewey, 1902, p. 16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of hands-on learning or experiential education, which is related to, but not synonymous with experiential learning. He argued that \"if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind\" (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp. 217–18). Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. Problem-Based Learning (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.\n\nDewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. Throughout the history of American schooling, education's purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the K–12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce. In \"The School and Society\" (Dewey, 1899) and \"Democracy of Education\" (Dewey, 1916), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1899; 1916).\n\nFor Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. For Dewey, \"The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education\" (Dewey, 1904, p. 18). Dewey's qualifications for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which \"work automatically, unconsciously\" (Dewey, 1904, p. 15). Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.\n\nFor many, education's purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. As Dewey notes, \"The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in the production of character.\"(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).\n\nAccording to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is \"impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now\" (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p. 25). However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill, and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a \"lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill, and character\" (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p. 242) of the nation's workforce. As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill, and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.\n\nDewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one's ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. \"No one,\" according to Dewey, \"can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 34). According to Dewey, it is not that the \"teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach,\" rather, \"a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35). The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.\n\nIn addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher \"is possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils\" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p. 37). For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 & Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. As Dewey notes, \"this further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 34).\n\nAccording to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one's knowledge with others. \"There are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. To the 'natural born' teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35). For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.\n\nThe best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). As Dewey notes, \"I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. The explanation is simple. They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 36). Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.\n\nAs a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings to the classroom. As Dewey notes, \"no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency\" (Dewey, TLS, p. 25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.\n\nAccording to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, they know that their career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome their genuine love and sympathy for their students. For Dewey, \"One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions\" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p. 35).\n\nIt is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on them because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.\n\nDewey's passions for teaching—a natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which \"work automatically, unconsciously\" (Dewey, 1904, p. 15). According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, \"The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. But later 'progress' may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers' journals, attending teachers' institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life\" (Dewey, 1904, p. 15). For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one's self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.\n\nAs Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, \"An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibility—it is to diffuse irresponsibility\" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p. 39). For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.\n\nAs well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (1896) and The New School for Social Research (1919), many of Dewey's ideas influenced the founding of Bennington College and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the Board of Trustees. Dewey's works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived Black Mountain College in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included Buckminster Fuller, Willem de Kooning, Charles Olson, Franz Kline, Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and Paul Goodman, among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the \"Black Mountain Poets\" a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Deweyan ideas have experienced revival as a major source of inspiration for the public journalism movement. Dewey's definition of \"public,\" as described in \"The Public and its Problems\", has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. \"The 'public' of public journalists is Dewey's public.\"\n\nDewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem. Since every action generates unintended consequences, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.\n\nIn \"The Public and its Problems\", Dewey presents a rebuttal to Walter Lippmann's treatise on the role of journalism in democracy. Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news. In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.\n\nDewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine. The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.\n\nDewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and conditions, in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge. Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge. The \"audience\" would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it. Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in \"The Public and Its Problems\": \"Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse. Communication can alone create a great community\" (Dewey, p. 142).\n\nDewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. \"The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy.\" (\"The Public and its Problems\", p. 149). This Great Community can only occur with \"free and full intercommunication.\" (p. 211) Communication can be understood as journalism.\n\nAs an atheist and a secular humanist in his later life, Dewey participated with a variety of humanistic activities from the 1930s into the 1950s, which included sitting on the advisory board of Charles Francis Potter's First Humanist Society of New York (1929); being one of the original 34 signatories of the first \"Humanist Manifesto\" (1933) and being elected an honorary member of the Humanist Press Association (1936).\n\nHis opinion of humanism is summarized in his own words from an article titled \"What Humanism Means to Me\", published in the June 1930 edition of \"Thinker 2\":\n\nWhile Dewey was at the University of Chicago, his letters to his wife Alice and his colleague Jane Addams reveal that he closely followed the 1894 Pullman Strike, in which the employees of the Pullman Palace Car Factory in Chicago decided to go on strike after industrialist George Pullman refused to lower rents in his company town after cutting his workers’ wages by nearly 30 percent. On May 11, 1894, the strike became official, later gaining the support of the members of the American Railway Union, whose leader Eugene V. Debs called for a nationwide boycott of all trains including Pullman sleeping cars. Considering most trains had Pullman cars, the main 24 lines out of Chicago were halted and the mail was stopped as the workers destroyed trains all over the United States. President Grover Cleveland used the mail as a justification to send in the National Guard, and ARU leader Eugene Debs was arrested. Dewey wrote to Alice: “The only wonder is that when the ‘higher classes’ – damn them – take such views there aren't more downright socialists... [T]hat a representative journal of the upper classes – damn them again – can take the attitude of that harper's weekly,” referring to headlines such as “Monopoly” and “Repress the Rebellion,” which claimed, in Dewey's words, to support the sensational belief that Debs was a “criminal” inspiring hate and violence in the equally “criminal” working classes. He concluded: “It shows what it is to be a higher class. And I fear Chicago Univ. is a capitalistic institution – that is, it too belongs to the higher classes.” Dewey was not a socialist like Debs, but he believed that Pullman and the workers must strive toward a community of shared ends following the work of Jane Addams and George Herbert Mead.\n\nAs a major advocate for academic freedom, in 1935 Dewey, together with Albert Einstein and Alvin Johnson, became a member of the United States section of the International League for Academic Freedom, and in 1940, together with Horace M Kallen, edited a series of articles related to the Bertrand Russell Case.\n\nAs well as defending the independence of teachers and opposing a communist takeover of the New York Teachers' Union, Dewey was involved in the organization that eventually became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, sitting as an executive on the NAACP's early executive board.\nHe was an avid supporter of Henry George's proposal for taxing land values. Of George, he wrote, \"No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker.\" As honorary president of the Henry George School of Social Science, he wrote a letter to Henry Ford urging him to support the school.\n\nHe directed the famous Dewey Commission held in Mexico in 1937, which cleared Leon Trotsky of the charges made against him by Joseph Stalin, and marched for women's rights, among many other causes.\n\nIn 1939, John Dewey was elected President of the League for Industrial Democracy, an organization with the goal of educating college students about the labor movement. The Student Branch of the L.I.D. would later become Students for a Democratic Society.\n\nDewey's interests and writings included many topics, and according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"a substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on current domestic and international politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes. (He is probably the only philosopher in this encyclopedia to have published both on the Treaty of Versailles and on the value of displaying art in post offices.)\"\n\nIn 1917, Dewey met F. M. Alexander in New York City and later wrote introductions to Alexander's \"Man's Supreme Inheritance\" (1918), \"Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual\" (1923) and \"The Use of the Self\" (1932). Alexander's influence is referenced in \"Human Nature and Conduct\" and \"Experience and Nature.\"\n\nAs well as his contacts with people mentioned elsewhere in the article, he also maintained correspondence with Henri Bergson, William M. Brown, Martin Buber, George S. Counts, William Rainey Harper, Sidney Hook, and George Santayana.\n\nDewey is considered the epitome of liberalism by historians, and sometimes was portrayed as \"dangerously radical.\" Meanwhile, Dewey was critiqued strongly by American communists because he argued against Stalinism and had philosophical differences with Marx, identifying himself as a democratic socialist.\n\nHistorians have examined his religious beliefs. Biographer Steven C. Rockefeller traced Dewey's democratic convictions to his childhood attendance at the Congregational Church, with its strong proclamation of social ideals and the Social Gospel. Historian Edward A. White suggested in \"Science and Religion in American Thought\" (1952) that Dewey's work led to the 20th-century rift between religion and science.\n\nBULLET::::- Copernican Citation (1943)\nBULLET::::- Doctor \"honoris causa\" – University of Oslo (1946)\nBULLET::::- Doctor \"honoris causa\" – University of Pennsylvania (1946)\nBULLET::::- Doctor \"honoris causa\" – Yale University (1951)\nBULLET::::- Doctor \"honoris causa\" – University of Rome (1951)\n\nBULLET::::- John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, New York is named after him.\nBULLET::::- John Dewey Academy of Learning in Green Bay, Wisconsin is a charter school named after him.\nBULLET::::- The John Dewey Academy in Great Barrington, MA is a college preparatory therapeutic boarding school for troubled adolescents.\nBULLET::::- John Dewey Elementary School in Warrensville Hts., Ohio, an Eastern Suburb of Cleveland, Ohio, is named after him.\nBULLET::::- John Dewey Elementary School in Flint, Michigan was named after him but the school is now a career training center – the Sylvester Broom Center.\nBULLET::::- John Dewey Middle School in Adams County in Denver, Colorado is a junior high school named after him.\n\nBesides publishing prolifically himself, Dewey also sat on the boards of scientific publications such as \"Sociometry\" (advisory board, 1942) and \"Journal of Social Psychology\" (editorial board, 1942), as well as having posts at other publications such as \"New Leader\" (contributing editor, 1949).\n\nThe following publications by John Dewey are referenced or mentioned in this article.

{"id": "16188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16188", "title": "Jackal", "text": "Jackal\n\nJackals are medium-sized omnivorous mammals of the genus \"Canis\", which also includes wolves, coyotes and the domestic dog. While the word \"jackal\" has historically been used for many small canids, in modern use it most commonly refers to three species: the closely related black-backed jackal and side-striped jackal of sub-Saharan Africa, and the golden jackal of south-central Eurasia, which is more closely related to other members of the genus \"Canis\".\n\nJackals and coyotes (sometimes called the American jackal) are opportunistic omnivores, predators of small to medium-sized animals and proficient scavengers. Their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals, birds, and reptiles, and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well-suited for long-distance running, capable of maintaining speeds of for extended periods of time. Jackals are crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk.\n\nTheir most common social unit is a monogamous pair, which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruding rivals and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces. The territory may be large enough to hold some young adults, which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories. Jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs, for example, to scavenge a carcass, but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs.\n\nThe English word \"jackal\" dates back to 1600 and derives from the French \"chacal\", derived from the Persian \"\", which is in turn derived from the Sanskrit शृगाल \"ṥṛgālaḥ\" meaning \"the howler\".\n\nSimilarities between jackals and coyotes led Lorenz Oken, in the third volume of his \"Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte\" (1815), to place these species into a new separate genus, \"Thos\", named after the classical Greek word \"jackal\", but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time. Angel Cabrera, in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of Morocco, questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of \"Canis\" could justify a subdivision of that genus. In practice, Cabrera chose the undivided-genus alternative and referred to the jackals as \"Canis\" instead of \"Thos\".\n\nOken's \"Thos\" theory was revived in 1914 by Edmund Heller, who embraced the separate genus theory. Heller's names and the designations he gave to various jackal species and subspecies live on in current taxonomy, although the genus has been changed from \"Thos\" to \"Canis\".\n\nThe wolf-like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because they all have 78 chromosomes. The group includes genus \"Canis\", \"Cuon\", and \"Lycaon\". The members are the dog \"(C. lupus familiaris)\", gray wolf (\"C. lupus\"), coyote (\"C. latrans\"), golden jackal (\"C. aureus\"), Ethiopian wolf (\"C. simensis\"), black-backed jackal (\"C. mesomelas\"), side-striped jackal (\"C. adustus\"), dhole (\"Cuon alpinus\"), and African wild dog (\"Lycaon pictus\"). The latest recognized member is the African golden wolf (\"C. anthus\"), which was once thought to be an African branch of the golden jackal. As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus \"Canis\" (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are karyologically indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog. The two African jackals are shown to be the most basal members of this clade, indicating the clade's origin from Africa. \"Canis arnensis\" arrived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9 million years ago and is probably the ancestor of modern jackals.\n\nThe paraphyletic nature of \"Canis\" with respect to \"Lycaon\" and \"Cuon\" has led to suggestions that the two African jackals should be assigned to different genera, \"Schaeffia\" for the side-striped jackal and \"Lupulella\" for the black-backed jackal or \"Lupulella\" for both.\n\nThe intermediate size and shape of the Ethiopian wolf has at times led it to be regarded as a jackal, thus it has also been called the \"red jackal\" or the \"Simien jackal\".\n style=\"background:#115a6c;\"\n!Species\n!Binomial authority\n!Description\n!Range\nBlack-backed jackal\"Canis mesomelas\"\n\nSchreber, 1775\nThe most lightly built jackal, it is considered to be the oldest living member of the genus \"Canis\".

The results showed that, unlike wolf–dog hybrids, jackal–dog hybrids show a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic disorders after three generations of interbreeding, much like coydogs.\n\nIn Russia, golden jackals are one of the founder breeds of the Sulimov dog, a working dog owned exclusively by Aeroflot and used for bomb detection in airport security.\n\nBULLET::::- Like foxes and coyotes, jackals are often depicted as clever sorcerers in the myths and legends of their regions.\nBULLET::::- \"Anubis\" (Ancient Greek: Ἄνουβις) is the Greek name for a jackal-headed god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.\nBULLET::::- The jackal (likely the golden jackal, given its present range) is mentioned roughly 14 times in the Bible.

{"id": "16190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16190", "title": "Jumping the broom", "text": "Jumping the broom\n\nJumping the broom (or jumping the besom) is a phrase and custom relating to a wedding ceremony where the couple jumps over a broom. \nIt has been suggested that the custom is based on an 18th-century idiomatic expression for \"sham marriage\", \"marriage of doubtful validity\"; it was popularized in the context of the introduction of civil marriage in Britain with the Marriage Act 1836.\n\nThere have also been suggestions that the expression may derive from an actual custom of jumping over a \"broomstick\" (where \"broom\" refers to the plant \"common broom\" rather than the household implement) associated with the Romanichal of the United Kingdom, especially those in Wales.\n\nThe custom of a marrying couple literally jumping over a broom is now most widespread among African Americans, popularized in the 1970s by the novel and miniseries \"\" but originating in the mid 19th century as a practice in antebellum slavery in the United States.\n\nReferences to \"broomstick marriages\" emerged in England in the mid-to-late 18th century, always to describe a wedding ceremony of doubtful validity. The earliest use of the phrase is in the 1764 English edition of a French work: the French text, describing an elopement, refers to the runaway couple hastily making \"un mariage sur la croix de l'épée\" (literally ‘marriage on the cross of the sword’), an expression the English translator freely renders as ‘performed the marriage ceremony by leaping over a broomstick’.\n\nA 1774 usage in the \"Westminster Magazine\" also describes an elopement. A man who had taken his under-age bride off to France discovered it was as hard to arrange a legal marriage there as in England, but declined a suggestion that a French sexton might simply read the marriage service through before the couple as \"He had no inclination for a Broomstick-marriage\". In 1789 the rumoured clandestine marriage between the Prince Regent and Maria Fitzherbert is similarly referred to in a satirical song in \"The Times\": \"Their way to consummation was by hopping o’er a broom, sir\".\n\nDespite these allusions, research by the legal historian Professor R. Probert of Warwick University has failed to find any proof of an actual contemporary practice of jumping over a broomstick as a sign of informal union. Probert also points out that the word \"broomstick\" was used in the mid-18th century in several contexts to mean ‘something ersatz, or lacking the authority its true equivalent might possess.’ She therefore argues that because the expression \"broomstick marriage\", meaning 'sham marriage', was in circulation, folk etymology led to a belief that people must actually have once signified irregular marriage by jumping over a broom. Tyler D. Parry, Assistant Professor of African American and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (USA), contests the claim that no literal jump was used in Britain, arguing that enslaved people of African descent and British migrants engaged in numerous cultural exchanges during the 18th and 19th centuries. He shows numerous correlations between the ceremonies of slaves and those of the rural British, contending it is not simply coincidental that two groups, separated by an ocean, utilized similar matrimonial forms revolving around the broomstick. If British practitioners never used a physical leap, Parry wonders how enslaved people in the US South learned of the custom.\n\nThere are later examples of the term \"broomstick marriage\" being used in Britain, always with a similar implication that the ceremony so performed did not create a legally binding union. This meaning survived into the early nineteenth century: during a case heard in London in 1824 regarding the legal validity of a marriage ceremony consisting of nothing more than the groom placing a ring on the bride's finger before witnesses, a court official commented that the ceremony \"amounted to nothing more than a broomstick marriage, which the parties had it in their power to dissolve at will.\"\n\nA decade later, the Marriage Act 1836, which introduced civil marriage, was contemptuously referred to as the ‘Broomstick Marriage Act’ by those who felt that a marriage outside the Anglican church did not deserve legal recognition. Some also began to use the phrase to refer to non-marital unions: a man interviewed in Mayhew's \"London Labour and the London Poor\" admitted: \"I never had a wife, but I have had two or three broomstick matches, though they never turned out happy.\"\n\nTinkers were said to have a similar custom of marriage called \"jumping the budget\", with the bride and groom jumping over a string or other symbolic obstacle.\n\nCharles Dickens' novel, \"Great Expectations\" (first published in serial form in the publication \"All the Year Round\" from 1 December 1860 to August 1861), contains a reference in chapter 48 to a couple having been married \"over the broomstick.\" The ceremony is not portrayed, but the reference indicates that the readers would have recognized this as referring to an informal, not a legally valid, agreement.\n\nIt has often been assumed that, in England, jumping over the broom (or sometimes walking over a broom), always indicated an irregular or non-church union (as in the expressions \"Married over the besom\", \"living over the brush\"), but there are examples of the phrase being used in the context of legal weddings, both religious and civil.\n\nOther sources have stepping over a broom as a test of chastity, while putting out a broom was also said to be a sign \"that the housewife’s place is vacant\" and a way, therefore, of advertising for a wife.\n\nIn America the phrase could be used as slang describing the act of getting married legally, rather than as specifying an informal union not recognised by church or state.\n\nIn Wales, Romani couples would get married by eloping, when they would \"jump the broom,\" or jump over a branch of flowering common broom or a besom made of broom. Welsh Kale and English Romanichals and Romanichal populations in Scotland practised the ritual into the 1900s.\n\nAccording to Alan Dundes (1996), the custom originated among Romani people in Wales (Welsh Kale) and England (Romanichal).\n\nC.W. Sullivan III (1997) in a reply to Dundes argued that the custom originated among the Welsh people themselves, known as \"priodas coes ysgub\" (\"besom wedding\"),\nSullivan's source is the Welsh folklorist Gwenith Gwynn (a.k.a. W. Rhys Jones), who assumed that the custom had once existed on the basis of conversations with elderly Welsh people during the 1920s, none of whom had ever seen such a practice. One had claimed that: \"It must have disappeared before I was born, and I am seventy-three\".\nGwynn's dating of the custom to the 18th century rested on the assumption that it must have disappeared before these elderly interviewees were born, and on his misreading of the baptism register of the parish of Llansantffraid Glyn Ceiriog.\nLocal variations of the custom were developed in different parts of England and Wales. Instead of placing the broom on the ground, and jumping together, the broom was placed in an angle by the doorway. The groom jumped first, followed by the bride. In southwest England, in Wales, and in the border areas between Scotland and England, \"[while some] couples ... agreed to marry verbally, without exchanging legal contracts[,] ... [o]thers jumped over broomsticks placed across their thresholds to officialize their union and create new households\", indicating that contractless weddings and jumping the broomstick were different kinds of marriage.\n\nIn some African-American communities, marrying couples will end their ceremony by jumping over a broomstick, either together or separately. This practice is well attested for as a marriage ceremony for slaves in the Southern United States in the 1840s and 1850s who were often not permitted to wed legally.\nIts revival in 20th century African American culture is due to the novel and miniseries \"\" (1976, 1977).\n\nAlan Dundes (1996) notes the unusual development of how \"a custom which slaves were \"forced\" to observe by their white masters has been revived a century later by African Americans as a treasured tradition\".\n\nThere have been occasional speculations to the effect that the custom may have origins in West Africa, but there is no direct evidence for this, although Dundes points to a custom of Ghana where brooms were waved above the heads of newlyweds and their parents. \nAmong southern Africans, who were largely not a part of the Atlantic slave trade, it represented the wife's commitment or willingness to clean the courtyard of the new home she had joined. Tyler D. Parry argues the Ghanaian connection is a weak case for its origins, especially considering the ritual used by slaves bears far more similarities to the custom in the British Isles. Parry argues that, despite the racial animus that characterized the US South in the nineteenth century, poor white southerners (many of them descendants of people who used irregular forms of matrimony in Britain) and enslaved people exchanged their cultures between one another at far greater rates than commonly acknowledged.\n\nSlave-owners were faced with a dilemma regarding committed relationships between slaves. While some family stability might be desirable as helping to keep slaves tractable and pacified, anything approaching a legal marriage was not. Marriage gave a couple rights over each other which conflicted with the slave-owners’ claims. Most marriages between enslaved blacks were not legally recognized during American slavery, as in law marriage was held to be a civil contract, and civil contracts required the consent of free persons. In the absence of any legal recognition, the slave community developed its own methods of distinguishing between committed and casual unions. \nThe ceremonial jumping of the broom served as an open declaration of settling down in a marriage relationship. Jumping the broom was always done before witnesses as a public ceremonial announcement that a couple chose to become as close to married as was then allowed.\n\nJumping the broom fell out of practice when blacks were free to marry legally. \nThe practice did survive in some communities, and the phrase \"jumping the broom\" was synonymous with \"getting married,\" even if the couple did not literally jump a broom. However, despite its smaller scale continuity in certain rural areas of the United States (among both black and white communities), it made a resurgence among African Americans after the publication of Alex Haley's \".\"\nDanita Rountree Green describes the African American custom as it stood in the early 1990s in her book \"Broom Jumping: A Celebration of Love\" (1992).\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Brenda Lee released the rockabilly song \"Let's Jump the Broomstick\" on Decca Records in 1959.\nVia its association with Wales and the popular association of the broom with witches, the custom has also been adopted by some Wiccans.\n\nA film titled \"Jumping the Broom\", directed by Salim Akil, and starring Paula Patton & Laz Alonso was released on 6 May 2011.\n\nIn a 2013 episode of Grey's Anatomy, Miranda Bailey and Ben Warren jump over a broom at the conclusion of their wedding ceremony.\n\nIn the classic 1977 TV mini-series \"Roots\", Kunta Kinte/\"Toby\" (played by John Amos as adult Kunta Kinte - Levar Burton played the teenager Kunta Kinte) had a marriage ceremony where he and Belle (played by Madge Sinclair) jumped the broom.\n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Birth of a Nation\", a couple getting betrothed is seen jumping a broom.\n\nIn an episode of The Originals (season 2) (Episode 13 \"The Devil is Damned\") the custom is described as being necessary when a priest is not available and the wedding \"couldn't wait.\"\n\nIn an episode of This Is Us (season 3) (Episode 16 \"R & B\") the characters of Randal and Beth are shown to jump the broom while walking down the aisle after their wedding ceremony in a flashback.\n\nThe custom has been reference twice by rap duo Outkast: in \"Call the Law\" on their 2006 album \"Idlewild\" and in 2007 song International Players Anthem (I Choose You).\n\n\nBULLET::::- Happy is the Bride the Sun Shines on at Googlebooks\n"}

{"id": "16193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16193", "title": "Jackie Robinson", "text": "Jackie Robinson\n\nJack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American professional baseball player who became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when he started at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of racial segregation in professional baseball that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\n\nDuring his 10-year MLB career, Robinson won the inaugural Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, was an All-Star for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949—the first black player so honored. Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 World Series championship.\n\nIn 1997, MLB retired his uniform number 42 across all major league teams; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored. MLB also adopted a new annual tradition, \"Jackie Robinson Day\", for the first time on April 15, 2004, on which every player on every team wears No. 42.\n\nRobinson's character, his use of nonviolence, and his unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of American life. He influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the civil rights movement. Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB and the first black vice president of a major American corporation, Chock full o'Nuts. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. After his death in 1972, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of his achievements on and off the field.\n\nJack Roosevelt Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia. He was the youngest of five children born to Mallie (McGriff) and Jerry Robinson, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed \"Mack\"), and Willa Mae. His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt, who died 25 days before Robinson was born. After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California.\n\nThe extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family. Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities. As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.\n\nIn 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School (Muir Tech). Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics) and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.\n\nAt Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the varsity level and lettered in four of them: football, basketball, track, and baseball. He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on the football team, and guard on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the broad jump. He was also a member of the tennis team.\n\nIn 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon. In late January 1937, the \"Pasadena Star-News\" newspaper reported that Robinson \"for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis.\"\n\nAfter Muir, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track. On the football team, he played quarterback and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack. As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white. While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military. In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.\n\nThat year, Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (\"Omicron Mu Delta\"), awarded to students performing \"outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition.\" Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.\n\nAn incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.\n\nAfter graduating from PJC in spring 1939, Robinson enrolled at UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.\n\nHe was one of four black players on the Bruins' 1939 football team; the others were Woody Strode, Kenny Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team's four backfield players. At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football's most They went undefeated with four ties at \n\nIn track and field, Robinson won the 1940 NCAA championship in the long jump at . Belying his future career, baseball was Robinson's \"worst sport\" at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his first game he went 4-for-4 and twice stole home.\n\nWhile a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, Rachel Isum (b.1922), a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career He played football as a senior, but the 1940 Bruins won only one game. In the spring, Robinson left college just shy of graduation, despite the reservations of his mother and Isum. He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government's National Youth Administration (NYA) \n\nAfter the government ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu in the fall of 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League. By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, which drew the United States into World War II and ended Robinson's nascent football career.\n\nIn 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.\n\nAfter receiving his commission, Robinson was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st \"Black Panthers\" Tank Battalion. While at Fort Hood, Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev. Karl Downs, President of Sam Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson University) in nearby Austin, Texas; Downs had been Robinson's pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC.\n\nAn event on July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's military career. While awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to the back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.\n\nBy the time of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The experiences Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.\n\nAfter his acquittal, he was transferred to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944. While there, Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout. Robinson took the former player's advice and wrote to Monarchs' co-owner Thomas Baird.\n\nAfter his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Samuel Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nIn early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues. Robinson accepted a contract for $400 per month. Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him. The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now communicate only by letter. In all, Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases. He also appeared in the 1945 East–West All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.\n\nDuring the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interests. No black man had played in the major leagues since Moses Fleetwood Walker in 1884, but the Boston Red Sox nevertheless held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore H. Y. Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets. He left the tryout humiliated, and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.\n\nOther teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: \"Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?\" Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player \"with guts enough not to fight back.\" After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to \"turn the other cheek\" to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts not containing a reserve clause. Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly \"Pittsburgh Courier\", who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck \"influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never completely gotten credit.\"\n\nAlthough he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945. On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season. On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals. In what was later referred to as \"The Noble Experiment\", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s. He was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues, and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first. Larry Doby, who broke the color line in the American League the same year as Robinson, said, \"One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of the reasons why Josh died so early—he was heartbroken.\"\n\nRickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides, and he went home to Pasadena.\nThat September, he signed with Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals, a post-season barnstorming team in the California Winter League. Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City. On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, the Rev. Karl Downs.\n\nIn 1946, Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League (the designation of \"AAA\" for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the 1946 season). Clay Hopper, the manager of the Royals, asked Rickey to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate, but Rickey refused.\n\nRobinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. He was not allowed to stay with his white teammates at the team hotel, and instead lodged at the home of Joe and Dufferin Harris, a politically active African American couple who introduced the Robinsons to civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as \"Dodgertown\" did not open until spring 1948), scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach. In Jacksonville, the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day, by order of the city's Parks and Public Property director. In DeLand, a scheduled day game was postponed, ostensibly because of issues with the stadium's electrical lighting.\n\nAfter much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach. Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the \"de facto\" baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.\n\nLater in spring training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base, allowing him to make shorter throws to first base. Robinson's performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs. Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played against him when they both lived in California. During Robinson's first at bat, the Jersey City catcher, Dick Bouknight, demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson, but Sandel refused. Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground out at his first at bat, Robinson ended up with four hits in his five trips to the plate; his first hit was a three-run home run in the game's third inning. He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals' 14–1 victory. Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 fielding percentage, and he was named the league's Most Valuable Player. Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example), the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson. Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards. In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.\n\nIn 1947, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman. On April 15, Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, more than 14,000 of whom were black. Although he failed to get a base hit, he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers' 5–3 victory. Robinson became the first player since 1884 to openly break the major league baseball color line. Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.\n\nRobinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, \"I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.\"\n\nRobinson was also derided by opposing teams. According to a press report, the St. Louis Cardinals threatened to strike if Robinson played and to spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was said to have been leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the \"New York Herald Tribune\"s Rutherford \"Rud\" Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his \"Tribune\" colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After it was published, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended. \"You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts,\" Frick was quoted as saying. \"I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another.\" Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. The Cardinals players denied that they were planning to strike, and Woodward later told author Roger Kahn that Frick was his true source; writer Warren Corbett said that Frick's speech \"never happened\". Regardless, the report led to Robinson receiving increased support from the sports media. Even \"The Sporting News\", a publication that had backed the color line, came out against the idea of a strike.\n\nRobinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg from Enos Slaughter. On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players and manager Ben Chapman called Robinson a \"nigger\" from their dugout and yelled that he should \"go back to the cotton fields\". Rickey later recalled that Chapman \"did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers. When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty men.\"\n\nRobinson did, however, receive significant encouragement from several major league players. Robinson named Lee \"Jeep\" Handley, who played for the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, \"You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them.\" In 1947 or 1948, Reese is said to have put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Boston or Cincinnati. A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, depicts Reese with his arm around Robinson. Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with ethnic epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he \"whispered a few words into Robinson's ear\", which Robinson later characterized as \"words of encouragement.\" Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games. Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.\n\nRobinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the Dodgers, with a batting average of .297, an on-base percentage of .383, and a .427 slugging percentage. He had 175 hits (scoring 125 runs) including 31 doubles, 5 triples, and 12 home runs, driving in 48 runs for the year. Robinson led the league in sacrifice hits, with 28, and in stolen bases, with 29. His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).\n\nFollowing Stanky's trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky). Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season. In a 12–7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, 1948, he hit for the cycle—a home run, a triple, a double, and a single in the same game. The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series.\nRacial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 when a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Larry Doby (who broke the color barrier in the American League on July 5, 1947, just 11 weeks after Robinson) and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson. In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to $ today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a vaudeville tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate. In 1948, Wendell Smith's book, \"Jackie Robinson: My Own Story\", was released.\n\nIn the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that \"Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second\". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.\n\nThat year, a song about Robinson by Buddy Johnson, \"Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?\", reached number 13 on the charts; Count Basie recorded a famous version. Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series.\n\nSummer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.\n\nIn 1950, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman with 133. His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000 ($ in dollars). He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 batting average, and 12 stolen bases. The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson's life, \"The Jackie Robinson Story\", in which Robinson played himself, and actress Ruby Dee played Rachael \"Rae\" (Isum) Robinson. The project had been previously delayed when the film's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man. \"The New York Times\" wrote that Robinson, \"doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.\"\n\nRobinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as \"Rickey's prima donna\". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, \"Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it.\"\n\nBefore the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the \"Montreal Standard\" as saying, \"Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post\"—although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.\n\nDuring the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137. He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the regular season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game and then hit a home run in the 14th inning, which proved to be the winning margin. This forced a best-of-three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants.\n\nDespite Robinson's regular-season heroics, on October 3, 1951, the Dodgers lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson's famous home run, known as the Shot Heard 'Round the World. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed \"how much of a competitor Robinson was.\" He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.\n\nRobinson had what was an average year for him in 1952. He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases. He did, however, record a career-high on-base percentage of .436. The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show \"Youth Wants to Know\", Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, George Weiss, on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player. Sportswriter Dick Young, whom Robinson had described as a \"bigot\", said, \"If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness.\" The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the outfield, with Jim Gilliam, another black player, taking over everyday second base duties. Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League, but according to the \"New York Post\", Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.\n\nIn 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals, leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another World Series loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats. He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for \"Our Sports\" magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend Joe Louis. Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis.\n\nIn 1954, Robinson had 62 runs scored, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles. The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base. Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series. Robinson missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base. That season, the Dodgers' Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.\n\nIn 1956, Robinson had 61 runs scored, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals. By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball. Robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end Game 7 of the 1956 World Series. After the season, the Dodgers traded Robinson to the arch-rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 cash (equal to $ today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock full o'Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company. Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to \"Look\" magazine two years previously, his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.\n\nRobinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line. After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation of the military in 1948. Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was \"a legend and a symbol in his own time\", and that he \"challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.\" According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's \"efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ... [His] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities.\"\n\nBeginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers. During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games. In 1999, he was posthumously named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.\n\nRobinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post–\"long ball\" era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning. Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more walks than strikeouts (740 to 291). Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947–56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 (Minnie Miñoso was the other). He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total, including 19 steals of home. None of the latter were double steals (in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time). Robinson has been referred to by author David Falkner as \"the father of modern base-stealing\".\n\nHistorical statistical analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position he played. After playing his rookie season at first base, Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman. He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951. Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.\n\nAssessing himself, Robinson said, \"I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being.\" Regarding Robinson's qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, \"Ya want a guy that comes to play. This guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya. He come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass.\"\n\nRobinson portrayed himself in the 1950 motion picture \"The Jackie Robinson Story\". Other portrayals include:\nBULLET::::- John Lafayette, in the 1978 ABC television special \"A Home Run for Love\" (broadcast as an \"ABC Afterschool Special\").\nBULLET::::- David Alan Grier, in the 1981 Broadway production of the musical \"The First\".\nBULLET::::- Michael-David Gordon, in the 1989 Off-Broadway production of the musical \"Play to Win\".\nBULLET::::- Andre Braugher, in the 1990 TNT television movie \"The Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson\".\nBULLET::::- Blair Underwood, in the 1996 HBO television movie \"Soul of the Game\".\nBULLET::::- Antonio Todd in \"Colors\", a 2005 episode of the CBS television series \"Cold Case\".\nBULLET::::- Chadwick Boseman, in the 2013 motion picture \"42\".\n\nRobinson was also the subject of a 2016 PBS documentary, \"Jackie Robinson\", which was directed by Ken Burns and features Jamie Foxx doing voice-over as Robinson.\n\nRobinson once told future Hall of Fame inductee Hank Aaron that \"the game of baseball is great, but the greatest thing is what you do after your career is over.\" Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5, 1957. Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, he was diagnosed with diabetes, a disease that also afflicted his brothers. Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, Robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on-field qualifications, rather than his cultural impact on the game. He was elected on the first ballot, becoming the first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum.\n\nIn 1965, Robinson served as an analyst for ABC's \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\" telecasts, the first black person to do so. In 1966, Robinson was hired as general manager for the short-lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football League. In 1972, he served as a part-time commentator on Montreal Expos telecasts.\n\nOn June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired his uniform number, 42, alongside those of Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32). From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was the vice president for personnel at Chock full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry. Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank's first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.\n\nRobinson was active in politics throughout his post-baseball life. He identified himself as a political independent, although he held conservative opinions on several issues, including the Vietnam War (he once wrote to Martin Luther King, Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration's military policy). After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential race against John F. Kennedy, Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively for his stance on civil rights. Robinson was angered by conservative Republican opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, though a higher percentage of Democrats voted against it in both the House and Senate. He became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller's unsuccessful campaign to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the 1964 presidential election. After the party nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona instead, Robinson left the party's convention commenting that he now had \"a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler's Germany\". He later became special assistant for community affairs when Rockefeller was re-elected governor of New York in 1966. Switching his allegiance to the Democrats, he subsequently supported Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in 1968.\n\nRobinson protested against the major leagues' ongoing lack of minority managers and central office personnel, and he turned down an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969. He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, \"I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I look at that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball.\" This wish was only fulfilled after Robinson's death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation to Jackie), a Hall of Fame-bound player who would go on to manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.\n\nAfter Robinson's retirement from baseball, his wife Rachel Robinson pursued a career in academic nursing. She became an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center. She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed in 1990. She and Jackie had three children: Jackie Robinson Jr. (1946–1971), Sharon Robinson (b. 1950), and David Robinson (b. 1952).\n\nRobinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had emotional trouble during his childhood and entered special education at an early age. He enrolled in the Army in search of a disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965. After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution. On June 17, 1971, he was killed in an automobile accident at age 24. The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader toward the end of his life.\n\nRobinson did not long outlive his son. Complications from heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, Robinson died of a heart attack at his home on 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford, Connecticut; he was 53 years old. Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at Upper Manhattan's Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, attracted 2,500 mourners. Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy. Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he was buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum. Twenty-five years after Robinson's death, the Interboro Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory. This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson's gravesite.\n\nAfter Robinson's death, his widow founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, and she remains an officer as of 2018. On April 15, 2008, she announced that in 2010 the foundation will be opening a museum devoted to Jackie in Lower Manhattan. Robinson's daughter, Sharon, became a midwife, educator, director of educational programming for MLB, and the author of two books about her father. His youngest son, David, who has six children, is a coffee grower and social activist in Tanzania.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted in 1947, Robinson was the second most popular man in the country, behind Bing Crosby. In 1999, he was named by \"Time\" on its list of the . Also in 1999, he ranked number 44 on the \"Sporting News\" list of Baseball's 100 Greatest Players and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-getter among second basemen. Baseball writer Bill James, in \"The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", ranked Robinson as the 32nd greatest player of all time strictly on the basis of his performance on the field, noting that he was one of the top players in the league throughout his career. Robinson was among the 25 charter members of UCLA's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984. In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante included Robinson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. Robinson has also been honored by the United States Postal Service on three separate postage stamps, in 1982, 1999, and 2000.\n\nThe City of Pasadena has recognized Robinson in several ways. Brookside Park, situated next to the Rose Bowl, features a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field. The city's Human Services & Recreation Department operates the Jackie Robinson Center, a community outreach center that provides health services. In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $ today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting oversized nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue, across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported by members of the Robinson family.\n\nMajor League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the \"Jackie Robinson Award\" in honor of the first recipient (Robinson's Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues). On April 15, 1997, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues. Under the terms of the retirement, a grandfather clause allowed the handful of players who wore number 42 to continue doing so in tribute to Robinson, until such time as they subsequently changed teams or jersey numbers. This affected players such as the Mets' Butch Huskey and Boston's Mo Vaughn. The Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who retired at the end of the 2013 season, was the last player in Major League Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis. Since 1997, only Wayne Gretzky's number 99, retired by the NHL in 2000, has been retired league-wide. There have also been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide in honor of Roberto Clemente, a sentiment opposed by the Robinson family. The Hispanics Across America advocacy group wants Clemente's number set aside the way the late Robinson's No. 42 was in 1997, but Sharon Robinson maintained the position that such an honor should remain in place for Jackie Robinson only.\n\nAs an exception to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After Griffey received her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all of MLB's uniformed personnel (including players) wore number 42 on April 15; this tradition has continued every year since on that date.\n\nAt the November 2006 groundbreaking for Citi Field, the new ballpark for the New York Mets, it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old Ebbets Field, would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The rotunda was dedicated at the opening of Citi Field on April 16, 2009. It honors Robinson with large quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large freestanding statue of his number, 42, which has become an attraction in itself. Mets owner Fred Wilpon announced that the Mets—in conjunction with Citigroup and the Jackie Robinson Foundation—will create a Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center, located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation at One Hudson Square, along Canal Street in lower Manhattan. Along with the museum, scholarships will be awarded to \"young people who live by and embody Jackie's ideals.\" The museum hopes to open by 2019. At Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, a statue of Robinson was introduced in 2017. The New York Yankees honor Robinson with a plaque in Monument Park.\n\nSince 2004, the Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year has been presented the \"Jackie Robinson Award\".\n\nRobinson has also been recognized outside of baseball. In December 1956, the NAACP recognized him with the Spingarn Medal, which it awards annually for the highest achievement by an African-American. President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on March 26, 1984, and on March 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave Robinson's widow the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress; Robinson was only the second baseball player to receive the award, after Roberto Clemente. On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, announced that Robinson was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.\n\nA number of buildings have been named in Robinson's honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium, which, because of the efforts of Jackie's brother Mack, features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis. The stadium also unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14, 2013. City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1990 and a statue of Robinson with two children stands in front of the ballpark. His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15. 1990. A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor to PJC) are named in Robinson's honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack. The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson, and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him. In 1976, his home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark. Brooklyn residents want to turn his home into a city landmark. Robinson also has an asteroid named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson. In 1997, the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five-dollar gold coin. That same year, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway in his honor. A statue of Robinson at Journal Square Transportation Center in Jersey City, New Jersey, was dedicated in 1998.\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. placed a plaque at Robinson's Montreal home to honor the ending of segregation in baseball. The house, at 8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park, was Robinson's residence when he played for the Montreal Royals during 1946. In a letter read during the ceremony, Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, wrote: \"I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city. Before Jack and I moved to Montreal, we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida. In the end, Montreal was the perfect place for him to get his start. We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there. The people were so welcoming and saw Jack as a player and as a man.\"\n\nOn November 22, 2014, UCLA announced that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him. The only sport this did not affect was men's basketball, which had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that sport to wear 42, with Hazzard's blessing). In a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three athletes (in women's soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues.\n\nA jersey that Robinson brought home with him after his rookie season ended in 1947 was sold at an auction for $2.05 million on November 19, 2017. The price was the highest ever paid for a post-World War II jersey.\n\nBULLET::::- Civil Rights Game (including MLB Beacon Awards)\nBULLET::::- DHL Hometown Heroes\nBULLET::::- Glass ceiling\nBULLET::::- List of African-American firsts\nBULLET::::- List of first black Major League Baseball players by team and date\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball batting champions\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball retired numbers\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball annual stolen base leaders\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball players who spent their entire career with one franchise\nBULLET::::- List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle\nBULLET::::- List of NCAA major college football yearly rushing leaders\nBULLET::::- List of NCAA major college yearly punt and kickoff return leaders\nBULLET::::- List of sports desegregation firsts\n\nBULLET::::- (2002 CASEY Award winner).\nBULLET::::- (2007 CASEY Award nominee).\nBULLET::::- (1997 CASEY Award nominee).\nBULLET::::- (1996 CASEY Award nominee).\nBULLET::::- (1983 CASEY Award nominee).\n\n, or Retrosheet\n"}

JNG files embed an 8-bit or 12-bit JPEG datastream in order to store color data, and may embed another datastream (1, 2, 4, 8, 16-bit PNG, or 8-bit JPEG grayscale image) for transparency information. However, a JNG may contain two separate JPEG datastreams for color information (one 8-bit and one 12-bit) to permit decoders that are unable to (or do not wish to) handle 12-bit datastreams to display the 8-bit datastream instead, if one is present.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the JNG specification was released on January 31, 2001 (initially as part of the MNG specification). Usually, all the applications supporting the MNG file format can handle JNG files too. For example, Konqueror has native MNG/JNG support, and MNG/JNG plugins are available for Opera, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox. The Mozilla Application Suite (and hence Netscape) originally supported MNG/JNG, but native support was removed in Mozilla 1.5a by developers, and Mozilla has not supported the format since, despite requests from its users. Safari does not support MNG/JNG.\n\nJNG enhances the capabilities of the JFIF format (the usual JPEG file format) by supporting transparency, two consecutive color streams (one 8-bit and the other 12-bit), and other useful PNG features like color correction, gamma correction, embedded color profiles, PNG-style metadata, checksums, etc. The transparency information inside a JNG file (as an alpha channel) can be saved either in lossless PNG format or in lossy JPEG format. This way, users can benefit from the power of JPEG compression while preserving lossless (PNG-compressed) transparency information.\n\nThe chunk-based structure of JNG files is essentially the same as that of PNG files, differing only in the slightly different signature and the use of different chunks.\n\n+ Network Graphics signatures\n!rowspan=\"2\" Name !!colspan=\"2\" Signature\n! hexadecimal !!

{"id": "16196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16196", "title": "Jane Shore", "text": "Jane Shore\n\nElizabeth \"Jane\" Shore (\"née\" Lambert) (c. 1445 – c. 1527) was one of the many mistresses of King Edward IV of England, one of three whom he described as \"the merriest, the wiliest, and the holiest harlots\" in his realm. She also became a concubine to other noblemen, including Edward's stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, his close friend and adviser.\n\nBorn in London in about 1445, Elizabeth Lambert was the daughter of a prosperous merchant, John Lambert, and his wife Amy, who was the daughter of a well-off grocer named Robert Marshall. The name \"Jane\", which has sometimes been attached to her, was the invention of a 17th-century playwright (Heywood), because during the course of the sixteenth century, her real first name was omitted, then forgotten by authors.\n\nSpending time in her father's shop at a young age may have brought the young Elizabeth into contact with ladies of high rank. C. J. S. Thompson's highly romanticised biography, \"The Witchery of Jane Shore, the Rose of London: The Romance of a Royal Mistress\" (1933) claimed that she was able to observe their behaviour and gain an understanding of the manners of those higher ranking than herself. She was thought to have been highly intelligent, and as a result received an education that was not usually associated with a person of her class. Thompson also claimed that her beauty earned her the title of \"The Rose of London\" – although this is not mentioned in contemporary sources.\n\nShe attracted many suitors, among them William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, friend and confidant of Edward IV. It is likely Hastings fell in love with Elizabeth Lambert before her marriage; his affection for her is apparent later in life by his continual protection of her. Her beauty was not the only characteristic that made her appealing for men; she was also admired for her pleasant, warm-hearted personality and her wit.\n\nSuch extreme attention made John Lambert desirous of finding his daughter a suitable husband. Such an opportunity presented itself with William Shore (d. 1494), a goldsmith and banker and common visitor to the Lambert home. He was approximately 14 or 15 years older than Jane. Though handsome and well-to-do, he never really won her affections. Their marriage was annulled in March 1476 after she petitioned for the annulment of her marriage on the grounds that her husband was impotent, which prevented her from fulfilling her desire to have children. Pope Sixtus IV commissioned three bishops to decide the case, and they granted the annulment.\n\nAccording to the Patent Rolls for 4 December 1476, it was during this same year that Shore began her liaison with Edward IV, after his return from France. Edward did not discard her as he did many of his mistresses, and was completely devoted to her. She had a large amount of influence over the king, but would not use it for her own personal gain. This was exemplified by her practice of bringing those out of favour before the king to help them gain pardon. Shore, according to the official records, was not showered with gifts, unlike many of Edward's previous mistresses. Their relationship lasted until Edward's death in 1483.\n\nShore's two other lovers were Edward IV's eldest stepson, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings. Grey's wife was the wealthy heiress Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington, who also happened to be Hastings' stepdaughter. Shore was instrumental in bringing about the alliance between Hastings and the Woodvilles, which was formed while Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was Protector, before he took the throne as King Richard III. She was accused of carrying messages between Hastings and Edward IV's widow, Elizabeth Woodville. It was because of her role in this alliance that Shore was charged with conspiracy, along with Hastings and the Woodvilles, against the Protector's government. \nShore's punishment included open penance at Paul's Cross for her promiscuous behaviour by Richard, though this may have been motivated by the suspicion that she had harboured Grey when he was a fugitive or as a result of Richard's antagonism towards any person who represented his older brother's court. A clash of personalities between the lighthearted Shore and stern Richard also generated a mutual dislike between the two. Shore accordingly went in her kirtle through the streets one Sunday with a taper in her hand, attracting a lot of male attention along the way.\n\nAfter her public penitence, Shore resided in Ludgate prison. While there, she captivated the King's Solicitor General, Thomas Lynom. After he expressed an interest in Shore to Richard, the King tried to dissuade him for his own good. This is evinced by a letter to John Russell from Richard, where the King asked the chancellor to try to prevent the marriage, but if Lynom were determined on the marriage, to release Shore from prison and put her in the charge of her father until Richard's next arrival in London when the marriage could take place. They were married and had one daughter. It is believed that Shore lived out the remainder of her life in bourgeois respectability. Lynom lost his position as King's Solicitor when Henry VII defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in August 1485, but he was able to stay on as a mid-level bureaucrat in the new reign, becoming a gentleman who sat on the commissions in the Welsh Marches and clerk controller to Arthur, Prince of Wales, at Ludlow Castle. Thomas More, writing when Shore was very old, declared that even then an attentive observer might discern in her shriveled countenance traces of her former beauty.\n\nFor a bibliography see James L. Harner, \"Jane Shore in Literature: A Checklist\" in \"Notes and Queries\", v. 226, December 1981, p. 496.\n\nBULLET::::- She is a significant character in \"The True Tragedy of Richard III\", an anonymous play written shortly before Shakespeare's \"Richard III\". In the play she is reduced to destitution on the streets, ignored by both former lovers and people she had helped after Richard frightens citizens with severe punishments if she is supported in any way.\nBULLET::::- \"Mistress Shore\" is frequently mentioned in William Shakespeare's play, \"Richard III\". (She actually appears in Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version, played by Pamela Brown – she has only one line: \"Good morrow, my Lord\", which is interpolated into the film. The film shows her as attending to Edward IV, but afterwards having a passionate affair with Lord Hastings.) Edward IV, Thomas Grey, and Lord Hastings are all characters in the play.\nBULLET::::- The story of Jane Shore's wooing by Edward IV, her influence in court, and her tragic death in the arms of Matthew Shore is the main plot in a play by Thomas Heywood, \"Edward IV\" (printed 1600). The play shows her struggling with the morality of accepting the king's offers, using her influence to grant pardons to those wrongfully punished, and expressing regret for her relationship with Edward. In this version, her first marriage is never annulled, but the two are reconciled right before dying and being buried together in \"Shores Ditch, as in the memory of them\". This is supposed to be the origin of the name Shoreditch.\nBULLET::::- \"The Tragedy of Jane Shore\" is a 1714 play by Nicholas Rowe. Rowe portrays her as a kind woman who encourages her lover Hastings to oppose Richard's usurpation of power. In revenge Richard forces her to do penance and to become an outcast. As in Heywood's version, her husband seeks her out and they are reconciled before she dies.\nBULLET::::- A performance of \"Jane Shore\" was given on Saturday 30 July 1796 at a theatre in Sydney, Australia. The pamphlet for the play was printed by a convict in the settlement, George Hughes, who was the operator of Australia's first printing press. The pamphlet for the play is the earliest surviving document printed in Australia. It was presented as a gift to Australia by the Canadian Government and is held at the National Library of Australia in the National Treasures collection in Canberra.\n\nBULLET::::- Thomas Churchyard published a poem about her in Mirror for Magistrates.\nBULLET::::- Anthony Chute's 1593 poem \"Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore's wife\" is supposed to be the lament of Jane Shore, whose ghost tells her life story and makes moral reflections.\nBULLET::::- Michael Drayton wrote a poem about her in his \"Heroical Epistles\".\nBULLET::::- Andrew Marvell refers to her in \"The King's Vows\", a satire on Charles II, in which the king says, \"But what ever it cost I will have a fine Whore, /As bold as Alce Pierce and as faire as Jane Shore.\"\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Goldsmith's Wife\" (1950) by Jean Plaidy\nBULLET::::- She appears in \"Anne, The Rose of Hever\" (1969) by Maureen Peters\nBULLET::::- She appears in \"Elizabeth, the Beloved\" (1972) by Maureen Peters\nBULLET::::- \"Figures in Silk\" (2008) by Vanora Bennett is told from her (fictional) sister Isabel's perspective as well as Jane's\nBULLET::::- She is the main character in Isolde Martyn's \"Mistress to the Crown\" (2013)\nBULLET::::- She is the main character in \"Royal Mistress\" (2013) by Anne Easter Smith.\nBULLET::::- She is mentioned several times and modern translation of the Thomas Lynom letter concerning her is published in Josephine Tey's novel \"The Daughter of Time\" (1956).\nBULLET::::- She appears as a minor character in \"The Sunne in Splendour\" (1982) by Sharon Kay Penman\nBULLET::::- Shore appears in Philippa Gregory's \"The White Queen\" (2009), a novel about Elizabeth Woodville, Queen Consort to Edward IV, under her real name, Elizabeth.
