{"id": "16274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16274", "title": "Jalalabad", "text": "Jalalabad\n\nJalālābād , or Dzalalabad, () is a city in eastern Afghanistan. It is the capital of Nangarhar Province. Jalalabad is located at the junction of the Kabul River and the Kunar River. It is linked by an approximately highway with Kabul to the west, and a highway with the Pakistani city of Peshawar to the east. Jalalabad has a population of 356,274 (2015 estimate), making it one of the five largest cities of Afghanistan.\n\nJalalabad is a leading center of social and trade activity because of its proximity with the Torkham border crossing, away. Major industries include papermaking, as well as agricultural products including oranges, lemon, rice, and sugarcane due to its warm climate. It has six districts and a total land area of . The total number of dwellings in this city is 39,586.\n\nFaxian visited and worshiped the sacred Buddhist sites such as of The Shadow of the Buddha in Nagarhara (modern Jalalabad). In 630 AD Xuan Zang, the famous Chinese Buddhist monk, visited Jalalabad, which he referred to as Adinapur, and a number of other locations nearby. The city was a major center of Gandhara's Greco-Buddhist culture in the past until it was conquered by Ghaznavids in the 11th century. However, not everyone converted to Islam at that period as some still refused to accept it. In \"Hudud-al-Alam\", written in 982 CE, there is reference to a village near Jalalabad where the local king used to have many Hindu, Muslim and Afghan wives.\n\nThe region became part of the Ghaznavid Empire in the 10th century. Sabuktigin annexed the land all the way west of the Neelum River in Kashmir. \"The Afghans and Khiljies who resided among the mountains having taken the oath of allegiance to Sabuktigin, many of them were enlisted in his army, after which he returned in triumph to Ghazni.\" The Ghurids succeeded the Ghaznavids and expanded the Islamic empire further into Hindustan. The region around Jalalabad later became part of the Khalji territory, followed by that of the Timurids.\n\nIt is said that the original name of Jalalabad was Adinapur. Jalalabad was named in honour of Mughal ruler Jalal-uddin in the last decade of the sixteenth century, the grandson of Babur. The modern city gained prominence during the reign of Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire. Babur had chosen the site for this city which was built by his grandson Jalal-uddin Mohammad Akbar in 1560.\n\nIt remained part of the Mughal Empire until around 1738 when Nader Shah and his Afsharid forces from Khorasan began defeating the Mughals. Nader Shah's forces were accompanied by the young Ahmad Shah Durrani and his 4,000-strong Afghan army from southern Afghanistan. In 1747, he founded the Durrani Empire (Afghan Empire) after re-conquering the area. The Afghan army has long used the city while going back and forth during their military campaigns into the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe British-Indian forces invaded Jalalabad in 1838, during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In the 1842 Battle of Jellalabad, Akbar Khan besieged the British troops on their way to Jalalabad. In 1878, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again invaded and set up camps in Jalalabad but withdrew two years later.\n\nJalalabad is considered one of the most important cities of the Pashtun culture. Seraj-ul-Emarat, the residence of Amir Habibullah and King Amanullah was destroyed in 1929 when Habibullah Kalakani rose to power; the other sanctuaries however, retain vestiges of the past. The mausoleum of both rulers is enclosed by a garden facing Seraj-ul-Emart. The Sulemankhils, a Pashtun family famous for their scientific research, is from Jalalabad. Other celebrated Pashtun families originate from the villages near Jalalabad too.\n\nFrom 1978 to early 1990s, the city served as a strategic location for the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In spring 1989, two Mujahideen rebel factions backed by Pakistan and the U.S. assaulted the city during the Battle of Jalalabad. However government forces managed to drive them out within two months, which was a major setback to the resistance fighters and the ISI. After the resignation of President Najibullah, Jalalabad quickly fell to mujahideen rebels of Yunus Khalis on April 19, 1992. On September 12, 1996, the Taliban took control of the city until they were toppled by the US-backed Afghan forces in late 2001. Al-Qaeda had been building terrorist training camps in Jalalabad. The city returned to Afghan government control under Hamid Karzai.\n\nThe economy of Jalalabad gradually increased in the last decade. Many of the city's population began joining the Afghan National Security Forces. Construction has also risen. The Jalalabad Airport has long served as a military base for the NATO forces. In 2011, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul announced that it plans to establish a consulate in Jalalabad. Occasional suicide attacks by anti-Afghanistan forces often take place. These forces include the Taliban, Haqqani Network, al-Qaeda, and the new ISIS (Daesh) group. The United States has promised to totally eliminate these groups before withdrawing from Afghanistan.\n\nThe city population is estimated to be 356,274 in year 2015.\n\nNearly all residents of Jalalabad are Muslim, followers of Sunni Islam. The city is home to one of Afghanistan's few Hindu temples, the Darga Hindu Temple founded in c. 1084 AD.\n\nJalalabad is the regional hub in eastern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. Agriculture is the predominant land use at 44%, higher density of dwellings is found in Districts 1-5 and vacant plots are largely clustered in District 6. Districts 1-6 all have a grid network of roads.\n\nJalalabad's climate is hot desert (Köppen: BWh), and it is one of the hottest localities in Afghanistan. The city's climate has close resemblance to that of Arizona in the United States. It receives six to eight inches (152 to 203 mm) of rainfall per annum which are limited to winter and the months of spring. Frosts are not common, and during the summer, the temperature can reach a maximum of 120 °F (49 °C).\n\nThe north and southwestern parts of the city which has lower elevation are welcoming places to winds from the north and west cooling the parts in summer months. Jalalabad has the highest relative humidity in summer compared to other Afghan cities. However the moderate temperatures of winter has led to various people down the history establishing their settlements in the city. Because of its warm temperature relative to most of Afghanistan, Jalalabad (alongside Peshawar) was often the \"winter capital\" of various Afghan rulers of the past centuries, while rich people would relocate to villas in Jalalabad to avoid the freezing temperatures in Kabul.\n\nJalalabad is home to a large number of fruits. Various types of citrus fruits like orange, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, lime grow in gardens as well as in orchards. The orange trees yield a crop only once in three years. The \"narindj\" variety of orange is the most common one which has yellow skin and its taste is a combination of orange and grapefruit. The grapefruits grown here have a diameter of eight or nine inches. Per year 1800 tonnes of pomegranates, 334 tones of grapes, and 7750 tones of mulberries are produced in Jalalabad. The fruits are either sold in local markets or transported to Kabul markets from where they are exported. The second most common crop is local \"vatani\" variety of sugarcane. It contains 15% sugar by weight.\n\nThe Jalalabad Airport was built for dual-use, civilian and military. It is designed to serve the population of Nangarhar Province and neighboring province for domestic flights. The airport is currently used by NATO-led forces, including the Afghan Air Force, and houses large number of ISAF forces. The airport is also used as one of the launching and monitoring spots of drone attacks in Pakistan.\n\nThere are proposals for the establishment of Afghanistan's rail network linking Jalalabad with Pakistan Railways, allowing for increased trade of goods, people and commerce between the two countries.\n\nJalalabad is connected by main roads with the Afghan capital of Kabul, the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and several nearby Afghan cities and towns. All trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan passes through this city. The highway between Jalalabad and Kabul was resurfaced in 2006, reducing the transit time between these two important cities. This highway is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world because of the large number of accidents. An improvement in the road networks between Jalalabad and Peshawar has also been proposed, with the intention of widening the existing road and improving security to attract more tourists and allow for safer passage of goods between to the two countries.\n\nOn the southeastern fringe of Jalalabad, a modern suburb called Ghazi Amanullah Town is under construction. Named after King Amanullah Khan. Construction has begun near the city on one of Afghanistan's cricket stadiums. It is hoped that this ground will serve the domestic competition and attract international teams.\n\nBULLET::::- Airports\nBULLET::::- Jalalabad Airport\n\nJalalabad Airport (IATA: JAA, ICAO: OAJL) is located southeast of Jalalabad city in Afghanistan. This airport is currently being used only for military purposes and sometimes the United Nations' aircraft use this airport. It is occupied and maintained by the United States Armed Forces. They operate out of Forward Operating Base Fenty, which is adjacent to Jalalabad Airport. The Afghan Air Force (AAF) and members of the International Security Assistance Force also use the airport.\n\nBULLET::::- New Jalalabad Airport\nHamidullah Qaderi, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan, announced in April 2009 the construction of a new civilian airport in the Gambiri area northwest of Jalalabad. The new airport will be constructed with financial assistance from the United States.\n\nBULLET::::- Foreign consulates\nIndia and Pakistan operate their consulate here for trade, military and political links.\n\nBULLET::::- Mausoleums\nBULLET::::- Mausoleum of King Amanullah Khan\nBULLET::::- Mausoleum of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan\nBULLET::::- Mausoleum of Mohammad Gul Khan Momand\nBULLET::::- Mosques\nBULLET::::- Hospitals\nJalalabad district has three hospitals: Fatumatu Zahra, Medical Hospital of Nangarhar, and the General Hospital of Public Health. The General Hospital of Public Health is one of the largest in the country.[8]\n, polio (NSL3) has been identified and reported in the Jalalabad district area. This specific case has been linked to others reported in the past due to the highly transient and mobile population.[9]\n\nBULLET::::- Universities\nBULLET::::- Nangarhar University\nNangarhar University (Pashto: د ننګرهار پوهنتون) is a government-funded higher learning institution in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. It is the second largest university in Afghanistan.[2] It has approximately 25 faculty and 3,500 students.[3]\nNangarhar University was established in 1962 as a medical college.[4] It was later merged with other local colleges to become a full-fledged university. It now houses faculties in agriculture, engineering, education, medicine, theology, pedagogy, political science and veterinary medicine.\n\nNangarhar consists of many faculties including engineering, political science, economics, teachers' training, veterinary, and computer science. Nangarhar Medical Faculty (NMF) is the second largest medical school in Afghanistan.\nThey also take part in an e-learning program organized by Afghans Next Generation e-Learning.\n\nThe nearest village within walking distance of Jalalabad is Ghouchak.\n\nThe province is represented in domestic cricket competitions by the Nangarhar province cricket team. National team member Hamid Hasan was born in the province and he currently represents Afghanistan in international cricket. The Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium is the first international standard cricket stadium in Afghanistan. It is located in the Ghazi Amanullah Town, a modern suburb on the southeastern fringe of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province. Construction on the stadium began in March 2010 when the foundation stone was laid by Minister of Finance and president of the Afghanistan Cricket Board, Omar Zakhilwal. The project, which was developed on 30 acres of land donated by the developer constructing the Ghazi Amanullah Town, cost up the first phase of construction $1.8 million. The first phase, which took one year to complete, included the completion of the stadium itself. The remainder of the phases will see the construction of a pavilion, accommodation for players and administrative buildings. The stadium, which has a capacity of 14,000, was completed before the national team and under-19 team left for Canada and the Under-19 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland respectively. The two sides inaugurated the stadium in a Twenty20 match.[2] It is hoped that the stadium will be able to attract international teams to play Afghanistan, who currently have One Day International status until at least 2013.\n\nBULLET::::- Professional sports teams from Jalalabad\n{ class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\"  Club\n! scope=\"col\"  League\n! scope=\"col\"  Sport\n! scope=\"col\"  Venue\n! scope=\"col\"  Established\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\"  Nangarhar Leopards\nAfghanistan Premier League\nCricket\nSharjah Cricket Stadium\n2018\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\"  Spin Ghar Tigers\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\"  De Spin Ghar Bazan F.C.\n\nBULLET::::- Stadiums\nBULLET::::- Ghazi Amanullah International Cricket Stadium\nBULLET::::- Sherzai Cricket Stadium (under construction)\nBULLET::::- National Football Stadium\n\nBULLET::::- San Diego, California, United States\n\nBULLET::::- Rashid Khan\n\nBULLET::::- List of cities in Afghanistan\n\nBULLET::::- Published in the 19th century\n\nBULLET::::- Published in the 20th century\n\nBULLET::::- Published in the 21st century\n\nBULLET::::- The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang By Sally Hovey Wriggins\n"}
{"id": "16275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16275", "title": "Jakarta", "text": "Jakarta\n\nJakarta (; ), officially the Special Capital Region of Jakarta (), is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Situated on the northwest coast of the world's most populous island of Java, it is the centre of economy, culture and politics of Indonesia with a population of more than ten million . The Jakarta metropolitan area, which has an area of 6,392 square kilometres, is the world's second most populous urban area after Tokyo, with a population of about 30 million . Jakarta's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures. Jakarta is nicknamed the \"Big Durian\", the thorny strongly-odored fruit native to the region, as the city is seen as the Indonesian equivalent of New York (Big Apple).\n\nEstablished in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. It was the \"de facto\" capital of the Dutch East Indies when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta is officially a province with special capital region status, though it is commonly referred to as a city. Its provincial government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat, making it an important city for international diplomacy. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. Jakarta has grown more rapidly than Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Beijing. In 2017, the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$483.4 billion.\n\nJakarta's prime challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding. Additionally, Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) per year, which, coupled with the rising of sea levels, has made the city more prone to flooding. It is also one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced a move of the capital to the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.\n\nJakarta has been home to multiple settlements.\nBULLET::::- Sunda Kelapa (397–1527)\nBULLET::::- Jayakarta (1527–1619)\nBULLET::::- Batavia (1619–1942)\nBULLET::::- Djakarta (1942–1972)\nBULLET::::- Jakarta (1972–present)\n\nIts current name 'Jakarta' derives from the word \"Jayakarta\" (Devanagari: जयकृत) which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit जय \"jaya\" (victorious) and कृत \"krta\" (accomplished, acquired), thus \"Jayakarta\" translates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act' or 'complete victory'. It was named after Muslim troops of Fatahillah successfully defeated and drove out the Portuguese away from the city in 1527. Before it was called Jayakarta, the city was known as 'Sunda Kelapa'. Tomé Pires, a Portuguese apothecary during his journey to East Indies, wrote the city name on his magnum opus as \"Jacatra\" or \"Jacarta\".\n\nIn the 17th century, the city was also known as \"Koningin van het Oosten\" (Queen of the Orient), for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout. After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas. During the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as .\n\nThe north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD. The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia. The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital. Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, \"Chu-fan-chi\", written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula and western Java (Sunda). The source says the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles. The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa, (Sundanese: ) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda kingdom.\n\nThe first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route for spices. The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate from central Java. In 1527, Fatahillah, a Javanese general from Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.\n\nThrough the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, the British East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of British trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682. Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the British merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.\n\nWhen relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and the British, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the British fort and forced them to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city \"Batavia\" in 1619.\n\nCommercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls. At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded are fabrics, mainly imported cotton, \"batik\" and clothing worn by Arab communities.\n\nThe city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The \"Koningsplein\", now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913, and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area. By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants, including 37,067 Europeans.\n\nOn 5 March 1942, the Japanese wrested Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (, in accordance with the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.\n\nFollowing World War II, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta during their fight for independence and established their capital in Yogyakarta. Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945, and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month.\n\nIn 1950, once independence was secured, Jakarta again became the national capital. Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture. Projects included a clover-leaf highway, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new parliament building. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese. The event marked the beginning of Suharto's New Order. A monument stands where the generals' bodies were dumped.\nThe first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor. Based on \"UU No. 5/1974\" relating to regional governments, Jakarta was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces.\nIn 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (\"Daerah Khusus Ibukota\"), with a status equivalent to that of a province. Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects — some for the benefit of the Suharto family— and tried to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty. Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta.\n\nThe boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest and political manoeuvring. After three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots and violence ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign. Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians. In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia. Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005, with another in 2009. In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the members of Jakarta Council (DPRD).\n\nJakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a deputy governor, while the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council (, abbreviated \"DPRD DKI (Jakarta)\") is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor, and the main administrative office.\n\nExecutive governance consists of five administrative cities/\"Kota Administratif\", each headed by a mayor—and one administrative regency/\"Kabupaten Administratif\" headed by a regent/\"Bupati\". Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent are directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regent are chosen by the governor of Jakarta. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.\n\nAside from representatives to the Regional Representative Council, Jakarta sends 21 members to the People's Representative Council. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which also includes overseas voters. The Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with a goal for smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.\n\nPolda Metro Jaya maintains the law, security and order of Jakarta. It is led by a Regional Chief of police \"Kapolda\", who holds the rank of Inspector General of Police.\n\nThe Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others. The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances.\n\nThe provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15–20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies. Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment. In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50 trillion ($US5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment and social spending (such as health and housing). Jakarta's regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1 trillion ($US5.92 billion), Rp 83.2 trillion ($US6.2 billion), and Rp 89 trillion ($US6.35 billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nJakarta consists of five \"Kota Administratif\" (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one \"Kabupaten Administratif\" (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts/Kecamatan. The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:\nBULLET::::- Central Jakarta (\"Jakarta Pusat\") is Jakarta's smallest city and the administrative and political centre. It is divided into eight districts. It is characterised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and museums.\nBULLET::::- West Jakarta (\"Jakarta Barat\") has the city's highest concentration of small-scale industries. It has eight districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town.\nBULLET::::- South Jakarta (\"Jakarta Selatan\"), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has ten districts and functions as Jakarta's groundwater buffer, but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the central business district is concentrated in Setiabudi, South Jakarta, bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta.\nBULLET::::- East Jakarta (\"Jakarta Timur\") territory is characterised by several industrial sectors. Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has ten districts.\nBULLET::::- North Jakarta (\"Jakarta Utara\") is bounded by the Java Sea. It is the location of Port of Tanjung Priok. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town and was the centre of VOC trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (Taman Impian Jaya Ancol), the largest integrated tourism area in South East Asia. North Jakarta is divided into six districts.\n\nThe only administrative regency (\"kabupaten\") of Jakarta is the Thousand Islands (\"Kepulauan Seribu\"), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its special ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.\n\n+ Jakarta's cities/municipalities (\"Kota Administrasi/Kotamadya\")\n!City/regency\n!width=\"70\"Area (km)\n! style=\"width:100px;\"Total population (2010 Census)\n! style=\"width:100px;\"Total population (2014)\n! style=\"width:100px;\"Population density(per km)in 2010\n!Population density(per km)in 2014\n!HDI 2015 estimates\n!

However Jakarta metropolitan area has an area of 6,392 square kilometres, which extends into two of the bordering provinces of West Java and Banten. The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).\n\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is of land area and of sea area. The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\nJakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from with an average elevation of above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.\nThese rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding. Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about each year, and up to in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project, known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta, is expected to be completed by 2025. In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city. Nowadays, a , with capacity per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.\n\nJakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\") according to the Köppen climate classification system. The wet season in Jakarta covers the majority of the year, running from October through May. The remaining four months (June through September) constitute the city's drier season (each of these four months has an average monthly rainfall of fewer than ). Located in the western part of Java, Jakarta's wet season rainfall peaks in January and February with average monthly rainfall of , and its dry season's low point is in August with a monthly average of .\n!Colspan=14Climate data for Jakarta\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!style=\"border-left-width:medium\"Year\n!Average sea temperature °C (°F)\nstyle=\"background:#FF2700;color:#FFFFFF;\"28.0(82.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF2700;color:#FFFFFF;\"28.0(82.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;\"30.0(86.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;\"30.0(86.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;\"29.0(84.0)\nstyle=\"background:#FF1300;color:#FFFFFF;border-left-width:medium\"29.0(84.0)\n!Mean daily daylight hours\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"12.0\nstyle=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"12.0\n!Average Ultraviolet index\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11\nstyle=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"10\nstyle=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"10\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"11+\nstyle=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"10.8\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"Source: Weather Atlas \n\nJakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta. Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980–1990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%. The 2010 census counted some 9.58 million people, well above government estimates. The population rose from 4.5 million in 1970 to 9.5 million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2 million in 1970 to 28.5 million in 2010. As per 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at ten million, with a population density of 15,174 people/km. As per 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30 million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population. It is predicted to reach 35.6 million people by 2030 to become the world's biggest megacity. The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010 and 101.3 in 2014.\n\nJakarta is a pluralistic and religiously diverse city. As of the 2010 Census, 36.17% of the city's population were Javanese, 28.29% Betawi, 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.08%.\n\nThe 'Betawi' (\"Orang Betawi\", or 'people of Batavia') are the descendants of the people living in and around Batavia and became recognised as an ethnic group around the 18th–19th century. They mostly descend from Southeast Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet labour needs. Betawi people are a creole ethnic group who came from various parts of Indonesia and intermarried with Chinese, Arabs and Europeans. Betawi form a minority in the city; most lived in the fringe areas of Jakarta with hardly any Betawi-dominated regions of central Jakarta.\nA significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. Officially, they make up 5.53% of the Jakarta population, although this number may be under-reported.\n\nThe Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2010 Census, roughly 346,000 Batak, 305,000 Minangkabau and 155,000 Malays lived there. The Batak and Minangkabau are spread throughout the city. The Batak ethnic group has increased in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest sub-ethnic Batak group in Jakarta. Minangkabau people generally work as merchants, peddlers, and artisans, with more in white-collar professions, such as doctors, teachers and journalists.\n\nIndonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak Dutch or Chinese, depending on their upbringing. Also English is widely used for communication, especially for those living in Central and South Jakarta. Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother language at home, such as Betawi, Javanese, and Sundanese. The Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Minangkabau, Chinese, and Arabic.\n\nIn 2017, Jakarta's religious composition was distributed over Islam (83.43%), Protestantism (8.63%), Catholicism (4.0%), Buddhism (3.74%), Hinduism (0.19%), and Confucianism (0.01%). About 231 people claimed to follow folk religions.\n\nMost \"pesantren\" (Islamic boarding schools) in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama, modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They give priority to education, social welfare programs and religious propagation. Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, including Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Jaringan Islam Liberal, and Front Pembela Islam.\n\nThe Roman Catholic community has a Metropolis, the Archdiocese of Jakarta that includes West Java as part of the ecclesiastical province. There is also a Bahá'í community.\n\nAs the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is the melting point of cultures of all ethnic groups of the country. Though Betawi people are considered as an indigenous community of Jakarta, the culture of the city represents many languages and ethnic groups, support differences in regard to religion, traditions and linguistics, rather than any single and dominant culture.\nThe Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a low profile in Jakarta, and most Betawi people have moved to the suburbs, displaced by new migrants. It is easier to find Java or Minang-based wedding ceremonies rather than Betawi weddings in Jakarta. It is easier to find Javanese Gamelan instead of \"Tanjidor\" (a mixture between Betawi and Portuguese music), \"Marawis\" (a mixture between Betawi and Yemeni music) or \"Gambang Kromong\" (a mixture between Betawi and Chinese music). The Chinese influenced Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\nSome festivals such as the \"Jalan Jaksa Festival\", \"Kemang Festival\", \"Festival Condet\" and \"Lebaran Betawi\" include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances. Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performances can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata theatre.\n\nArts and culture festivals and exhibitions include the annual Jakarta International Film Festival (JiFFest), Djakarta Warehouse Project, Jakarta Fashion Week, Jakarta Fashion & Food Festival (JFFF), Jakarnaval, Jakarta Night Festival, Kota Tua Creative Festival, Indonesia International Book Fair (IIBF), Indonesia Creative Products and Jakarta Arts and Crafts exhibition. Art Jakarta is a contemporary art fair, which is held annually. \"Flona Jakarta\" is a flora-and-fauna exhibition, held annually in August at Lapangan Banteng Park, featuring flowers, plant nurseries, and pets. Jakarta Fair is held annually from mid-June to mid-July to celebrate the anniversary of the city and is mostly centred around a trade fair. However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians. Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world and arguably the biggest in the Southern hemisphere, and is held annually in March.\n\nSeveral foreign art and culture centres are established in Jakarta and mainly serve to promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries and art galleries. These include the Chinese Confucius Institute, the Dutch Erasmus Huis, the British Council, the French Alliance Française, the German Goethe-Institut, the Japan Foundation, and the Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center.\n\nAll varieties of Indonesian cuisine have a presence in Jakarta. The local cuisine is Betawi cuisine, which reflects various foreign culinary traditions. Betawi cuisine is heavily influenced by Malay-Chinese Peranakan cuisine, Sundanese and Javanese cuisine, which is also influenced by Indian, Arabic and European cuisines. One of the most popular local dishes of Betawi cuisine is \"Soto Betawi\" which is prepared from chunks of beef and offal in rich and spicy cow's milk or coconut milk broth. Other popular Betawi dishes include \"soto kaki, nasi uduk, kerak telor\" (spicy omelette), \"nasi ulam, asinan, ketoprak, rujak\" and \"gado-gado\" Betawi (salad in peanut sauce).\n\nJakarta cuisine can be found in modest street-side \"warung\" food stalls and \"kaki lima\" (five legs) travelling vendors to high-end fine dining restaurants. Live music venues and exclusive restaurants are abundant. Many traditional foods from far-flung regions in Indonesia can be found in Jakarta. For example, traditional Padang restaurants and low-budget \"Warteg\" (\"Warung Tegal\") food-stalls are ubiquitous in the capital. Other popular street foods include \"nasi goreng\" (fried rice), \"sate\" (skewered meats), \"pecel lele\" (fried catfish), \"bakso\" (meatballs), \"bakpau\" (Chinese bun) and \"siomay\" (fish dumplings).\n\nJalan Sabang, Jalan Sidoarjo, Jalan Kendal at Menteng area, Kota Tua, Blok S, Blok M, Jalan Tebet are all popular destinations for street-food lovers.\nTrendy restaurants, cafe and bars can be found at Menteng, Kemang, Jalan Senopati, Kuningan, Senayan, Pantai Indah Kapuk, and Kelapa Gading. Chinese street-food is plentiful at Jalan Pangeran, Manga Besar and Petak Sembilan in the old Jakarta area, while the \"Little Tokyo\" area of Blok M has many Japanese style restaurants and bars. Lenggang Jakarta is a food court, accommodating small traders and street vendors, where Indonesian foods are available within a single compound. At present, there are two such food courts, located at Monas and Kemayoran.\n\nGlobal fast-food chains like McDonald's, KFC, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Wendy's, A&W, Fatburger, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts are present, along with local brands like J'CO, Es Teler 77, Kebab Turki, CFC, and Japanese HokBen. Foreign cuisines such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Indian, American, French, Mediterranean cuisine's like Turkish, Italian, Middle-Eastern cuisine, and modern fusion food restaurants can all be found in Jakarta.\n\nJakarta hosts 142 museums, clustered around the Central Jakarta's Merdeka Square area, Jakarta Old Town and Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. The Old Town contains museums in former institutional buildings of colonial Batavia, including Jakarta History Museum (former City Hall of Batavia), Wayang Museum (Puppet Museum) (former Church of Batavia), the Fine Art and Ceramic Museum (former Court House of Justice of Batavia), the Maritime Museum (former Sunda Kelapa warehouse), Bank Indonesia Museum (former Javasche Bank) and Bank Mandiri Museum (former \"Nederlandsche Handels Maatschappij\").\n\nMuseums clustered in central Jakarta around the Merdeka Square area include National Museum of Indonesia which also known as \"Gedung Gajah\" (the Elephant Building), National Gallery of Indonesia, National History Museum at National Monument, Istiqlal Islamic Museum in Istiqlal Mosque and Jakarta Cathedral Museum on the second floor of Jakarta Cathedral. Also in central is the Taman Prasasti Museum (former cemetery of Batavia), and Textile Museum in Tanah Abang area. Museum MACAN is an art museum of modern and contemporary Indonesian and international art located at West Jakarta.\n\nThe recreational area of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah in East Jakarta contains fourteen museums, such as Indonesia Museum, Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum, Asmat Museum, Bayt al-Qur'an Islamic Museum, Pusaka (heirloom) Museum, and other science-based museum such as Research & Technology Information Center, Komodo Indonesian Fauna Museum, Insect Museum, Petrol and Gas Museum, plus the Transportation Museum. Other museums include Satria Mandala Military Museum, Museum Sumpah Pemuda, and Lubang Buaya (Crocodile Well).\n\nJakarta has numerous newspapers, television and radio stations. Daily newspapers include \"Kompas\", \"Koran Tempo\", \"Media Indonesia\", and \"Republika\". English-language newspapers are also published daily, for example, \"The Jakarta Post\" and \"The Jakarta Globe\". Chinese language newspapers also circulate, such as \"Indonesia Shang Bao\" (印尼商报), \"Harian Indonesia\" (印尼星洲日报), and \"Guo Ji Ri Bao\" (国际日报). The only Japanese language newspaper is \"The Daily Jakarta Shimbun\" (じゃかるた新聞). Jakarta also has the daily newspapers segment such as \"Pos Kota\", \"Warta Kota\", \"Koran Jakarta\", \"Berita Kota\" for local readers; \"Bisnis Indonesia\", \"Investor Daily\", \"Kontan\", \"Harian Neraca\" (business news) as well as \"Top Skor\" and \"Soccer\" (sports news).\n\nJakarta is the headquarters for Indonesia's state media, TVRI as well as private national television networks, such as Metro TV, tvOne, Kompas TV, Trans TV, Trans 7, RCTI, MNC, SCTV, GTV, Indosiar, ANTV, RTV and NET. Jakarta has local television channels such as Jak TV, O Channel, Elshinta TV, and DAAI TV Indonesia. The city is home to the country's leading pay television service. Cable channels available includes First Media and TelkomVision. Satellite television (DTH) has yet to gain mass acceptance in Jakarta. Prominent DTH entertainment services are Indovision, Okevision, Yes TV, Transvision, and Aora TV. Many TV stations are analogue PAL, but some are now converting to digital signals using DVB-T2 following a government plan to digital television migration.\n!Channel\n!Name\n!Type\n!Language\n!Country of region\n22 UHF\nLocal\nrowspan=24Indonesian\nrowspan=24\n23 UHF\nRTV\nrowspan=\"2\"National\n25 UHF\nKompas TV\n26 UHF\nLocal\n27 UHF\nNET.\nNational\n28 UHF\nLocal\n29 UHF\nTrans TV\nrowspan=\"2\"National\n30 UHF\niNews TV\n31 UHF\nTVRI Jakarta & Banten\nrowspan=\"3\"Local\n33 UHF\n\n35 UHF\n\n37 UHF\nMNCTV\nrowspan=\"9\"National\n39 UHF\nTVRI Nasional\n41 UHF\nIndosiar\n43 UHF\nRCTI\n45 UHF\nSCTV\n47 UHF\nantv\n49 UHF\nTrans7\n51 UHF\nGTV\n53 UHF\ntvOne\n55 UHF\nJakTV\nLocal\n57 UHF\nMetro TV\nNational\n59 UHF\nrowspan=\"2\"Local\n60 UHF\n75 radio stations broadcast in Jakarta, 52 on the FM band, and 23 on the AM band.\n\nIndonesia is the largest economy of ASEAN, and Jakarta is the economic nerve centre of the Indonesian archipelago. Jakarta's nominal GDP was US$483.8 billion in 2016, which is about 17.5% of Indonesia's. According to \"Japan Center for Economic Research\", GRP per capita of Jakarta will rank 28th among the 77 cities in 2030 from 41st in 2015, the largest in Southeast Asia. Savills Resilient Cities Index has predicted Jakarta to be within the top 20 cities in the world by 2028.\n\nJakarta's economy depends highly on manufacturing and service sectors such as banking, trading and financial. Industries include electronics, automotive, chemicals, mechanical engineering and biomedical sciences. The head office of Bank Indonesia and Indonesia Stock Exchange are located in the city. Most of the SOE include Pertamina, PLN, PGN, Angkasa Pura, BULOG, Telkomsel, and Waskita operate head offices in the city, as do major Indonesian conglomerates, such as Salim Group, Sinar Mas Group, Astra International, Lippo Group, Gudang Garam, Kompas-Gramedia, and MNC Group. Headquarter of Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Indonesian Employers Association are also located in the city. As of 2017, the city is home to six Forbes Global 2000, two Fortune 500 and four Unicorn companies.\nAs of 2018, Jakarta contributes about 17% of Indonesia's GRDP (Gross Regional Domestic Product). In 2017, the economic growth was 6.22%. Throughout the same year, the total value of investment was Rp 108.6 trillion (US$8 billion), an increase of 84.7% from the previous year. In 2015, GDP per capita was estimated at Rp 194.87 million (US$14,570). The most significant contributions to GRDP were by finance, ownership and business services (29%); trade, hotel and restaurant sector (20%), and manufacturing industry sector (16%). In 2007, the increase in per capita GRDP of Jakarta inhabitants was 11.6% compared to the previous year Both GRDP by at current market price and GRDP by at 2000 constant price in 2007 for the Municipality of Central Jakarta, which was Rp 146 million and Rp 81 million, was higher than other municipalities in Jakarta.\n\nThe Wealth Report 2015 by Knight Frank reported that 24 individuals in Indonesia in 2014 had wealth at least US$1 billion and 18 live in Jakarta. The cost of living continues to rise. Both land price and rents have become expensive. Mercer's \"2017 Cost of Living Survey\" ranked Jakarta as 88th costliest city in the world for expatriates. Industrial development and the construction of new housing thrive on the outskirts, while commerce and banking remain concentrated in the city centre. Jakarta has a bustling luxury property market. Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy based in London, reported in 2014 that Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world in 2013, citing a supply shortage and a sharply depreciated currency as reasons.\n\nJakarta has numerous shopping malls and markets. With a total of 550 hectares, the city has the world's largest shopping mall floor area within a single city. The annual Jakarta Great Sale Festival is held every year in June and July to celebrate Jakarta's anniversary, with about 83 participating shopping malls in 2018. Malls include Plaza Indonesia, Grand Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, Senayan City and Pacific Place, Mall Taman Anggrek, and Pondok Indah Mall.\n\nMost of the world-renowned fashion retail brands have a presence in Jakarta. Department stores in Senayan City and Lippo Mall Kemang Village use the Debenhams brand under licence, while the Japanese Sogo department store has about seven stores. Seibu flagship store is located in Grand Indonesia Shopping Town, and French luxury department store, Galeries Lafayette opened its doors for the first time in Southeast Asia at the Pacific Place. The Satrio-Casablanca corridor, 3.5-kilometre street is a new shopping belt in Jakarta. Many multistorey shopping centres are located there, such as Kuningan City, Mal Ambassador, Kota Kasablanka, and Lotte Shopping Avenue. There is also cluster of shopping malls at Grogol and Puri Indah in West Jakarta.\n\nTraditional markets include Blok M, Pasar Mayestik, Tanah Abang, Senen, Pasar Baru, Glodok, Mangga Dua, Cempaka Mas, and Jatinegara. Special markets sell antique goods at Surabaya Street and gemstones in Rawabening Market.\nJakarta has been named the most popular location as per tag stories and ranked eighth most-posted among the cities in the world in 2017 on image-sharing site Instagram. It is not a top international tourist destination, although it ranked as the fifth fastest-growing destination among 132 cities according to MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index published in September 2017. 59.1% of visitors came for business, while the other 40.9% were visiting for leisure. According to \"Euromonitor International's latest Top 100 City Destinations Ranking\", Jakarta ranked at 83 with more than 3.5 million international tourists visited in a year, 48.5% higher in comparison to the previous year. In 2017, World Travel and Tourism Council listed Jakarta as among the top ten fastest-growing tourism cities in the world and categorised it as an \"emerging performer\", which will see a significant increase in tourist arrivals in less than ten years.\n\nMost of the visitors attracted to Jakarta are domestic tourists. As the gateway of Indonesia, Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as Bali, Lombok, Komodo Island and Yogyakarta. Jakarta is trying to attract more international tourist by MICE tourism, by arranging increasing numbers of conventions. In 2012, the tourism sector contributed Rp. 2.6 trillion (US$268.5 million) to the city's total direct income of Rp. 17.83 trillion (US$1.45 billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011.\n\nThe popular heritage tourism attractions are in Kota and around Merdeka square. Kota is the centre of old Jakarta, with its Maritime Museum, Kota Intan Bridge, Gereja Sion, Wayang Museum, Stadhuis Batavia, Fine Art and Ceramic Museum, Toko Merah, Bank Indonesia Museum, Bank Mandiri Museum, Jakarta Kota Station, and Glodok (Chinatown). Kota Tua was named the most-visited destination in Indonesia in 2017 by Instagram. In the old ports of Sunda Kelapa, the tall-masted pinisi ships are still anchored.\n\nOther tourist attractions include the Thousand Islands, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah, Setu Babakan, Ragunan Zoo, Sunda Kelapa old port and the Ancol Dreamland complex on Jakarta Bay, which houses Dunia Fantasi (Fantasy World) theme park, Sea World, Atlantis Water Adventure, and Gelanggang Samudra. Thousand Islands, which is north to the coast of the city and in the Java Sea is also a popular tourist destination.\n\nMost international hotel chains have a presence in the city. Jalan Jaksa and surrounding areas are popular among backpackers for cheaper accommodation, travel agencies, second-hand bookstores, money changers, laundries and pubs. PIK is a relatively new suburb for hangout, while Kemang is a popular suburb for expats.\n\nTwo private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. 80% of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River, southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading the private water companies to cut down on investments.\n\nAccording to PALYJA in its western half of the concession, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010. According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterwards. However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005, while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011. Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.\n\nJakarta has many of the country's best-equipped private and public facilities in healthcare. In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care called the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN). It is the world's most extensive insurance system today that covers around 250 million people. It is expected that the entire population will be covered in 2019.\n\nHospitals are of a good standard; however, they are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital as well as community hospitals Puskesmas. Private hospitals and clinics are the other options for healthcare services. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes, as the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organizations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Hermina operate in the city.\n\nDespite a variety of transport systems, Jakarta faces traffic congestion during rush hours. The city prioritised development of road networks, which were designed to accommodate private vehicles. According to the National Development Planning Agency, or Bappenas, traffic congestion in Greater Jakarta wastes about $7.4 billion each year due to congestion. As of 2018, there are over 13 million motorcycles and 4.4 million cars run on the roads of Jakarta. About 3.6 million commuters commute from the outskirts. 58% of these commuters use motorcycles, 12.8% use cars and only 27% use public transportation. The city's 9.5% average annual growth rate of motorised vehicles far exceeds the 0.01% increase in road length between 2005 and 2010. As of 2019, mobility rate is about 88 million movements per day in Jakarta metro area,public transportation serves only 30% of commuter trips. \nThe first public transport system in the city was Jakarta Tramline, which opened in 1869 and ceased operation in 1962. At present, public transit consists of BRT TransJakarta, rail transit KRL Commuterline, Jakarta MRT, Jakarta LRT and Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link. Another transit system under construction is the Greater Jakarta LRT, which is expected to be operational by 2021. There are several transit oriented development now under construction like Dukuh Atas TOD to facilitate commuters to transfer between different mode of public transportation. The city administration is also implementing a one-fare integrated payment public transportation system by for all public transportation using \"Jak Lingko\" card.\n\nA structured road network was developed in the early 19th century as a part of the Java Great Post Road by former Governor-General Daendels. It connects most cities throughout Java. During the following decades, the expanding road network could not keep up with the increasing numbers of motorised vehicles. A toll road network composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards provides inner as well as outer city connections. Jakarta Outer Ring Road 2 is a toll road encircling greater Jakarta area, parallel with Jakarta Outer Ring Road. Jakarta Elevated Toll Road with a dedicated public transportation lane, connecting Jakarta Inner Ring Toll Road which is 69.77 kilometres in length is under construction.\n\nMany attempts have been made to reduce traffic congestion, including a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers were prohibited, a ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day, and an 'odd-even' policy that permitted cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates to drive on alternate days. Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) is expected to be operational by 2019 along with the opening of the Jakarta MRT.\n\nMany bus routes connect neighbourhoods within the city limit to other areas of Greater Jakarta area and to cities across the island. The biggest bus terminal in the city, and arguably in Southeast Asia as well, is the Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal.\n\nIn 1971, cycle rickshaws (\"becak\") were banned from major roads. Shortly thereafter, the government attempted a total ban, which substantially reduced their numbers. From the early 1940s to 1991, Bajaj auto-rickshaws were common, later allowed only in the back streets of some parts of the city.\nBicycle-sharing company Gowes, which means \"to paddle,\" in Indonesian, started operation in limited areas of Jakarta in 2018.As of November 2019, Jakarta has 63 kilometres of separate bicycle lane, which will be extended to 200 kilometres by 2020.\nAlthough \"ojek\" (motorcycle taxis) are not an official form of public transport, they can be found throughout. Recently, most ojeks are operated by transportation network companies such as Go-Jek and Grab. Angkot micro-buses play a major role in connecting neighbourhoods of the city. There are plenty of taxicabs along with Go-Jek and Grab.\n\nTransJakarta serves as the bus rapid transit service, including the world's longest bus rapid transit routes ( in length). TransJakarta had a total of 128 routes as of April 2018 (corridor, cross route & feeder route) – a significant increase from 41 in 2015. TransJakarta targeted to serve one million passengers per day by the end of 2018. Other private owned bus systems like Kopaja, MetroMini, and etc.\n\nJakarta city government provides free double-decker \"City tour bus service\" that offers sightseeing. Tourists can catch the double-decker bus—free of charge, in several designated bus stops in front of the city's points of interest. Several routes cover tourist attractions such as Monas, Istiqlal Mosque, the Cathedral, National Museum, Sarinah, Hotel Indonesia crossing, Kota Tua and Kalijodo Park. The service includes Kota Tua in the north, Kalijodo Park in the west and Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan area in the south, via Sudirman avenue. TransJakarta operates free tour buses every Saturday from 5 PM to 11 PM to popular culinary destinations in Central Jakarta. TransJakarta has special bus service to move shoppers from one mall to another, including Grand Indonesia, Plaza Indonesia, Plaza Senayan, Senayan City and fX Sudirman.\n\nLong-distance railways and local tram services were introduced during the colonial era. The first station was built in 1887 by a private railway company, which later became Jakarta Kota station. The trams were replaced with buses in the post-colonial era, while long-distance railways continued to connect the city to its neighbouring regions as well as cities throughout Java. The main terminals for long-distance train services are Gambir and Pasar Senen. High-speed railways are under construction connecting Jakarta to Bandung, while a line between Jakarta and Surabaya is in planning.\nKRL Commuterline is a commuter rail system that reaches Rangkasbitung in Banten and Cikarang in Bekasi Regency. The rail system uses rolling stock of rapid transit standard and operates at high frequency with a minimum headway. Daily ridership average was about 1 million, totalling 336.7 million passengers in 2018.\n\nJakarta MRT is constructing a north–south line metro between Kota and Lebak Bulus, and an east–west line that will connect to the north–south line at Sawah Besar station. The first, 15.2 km-long line between Hotel Indonesia and Lebak Bulus is opened at March 2019 with 13 stations (seven elevated and six underground). When complete, the network will stretch approximately . The MRT operates 285 trips daily from 5 AM until midnight, with 5 minutes headway.\n\nGreater Jakarta LRT was aimed to tackle Jakarta's high road traffic congestion. The northern section of the LRT project partly replaces the Jakarta Monorail project that has been cancelled. The system is planned to connect Jakarta city centre with suburbs such as Bekasi, Bogor and Depok. The first phase will connect east Bekasi and Cibubur with Dukuh, passing through Cawang intersection. This phase will be long, with 18 stations. Another Jakarta LRT line connecting Kelapa Gading district and Jakarta International Velodrome opened for public trial in June 2019 and is not yet fully operational.\n\nSoekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link is a commuter train service connecting the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to the city centre. Another express train service is now in planning to connect Soekarno-Hatta International Airport with Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. Completion of this line is expected to be in 2019.\n\nSoekarno–Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport, located in Tangerang, Banten. The airport was ranked 18th busiest by Airports Council International, with about 63 million passengers in 2017. The Soekarno–Hatta Airport Rail Link connects the airport to Sudirman Baru railway station, Central Jakarta. A second airport, Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) serves domestic low-cost airlines, private and VIP flights. Other airports include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago (\"Kepulauan Seribu\").\n\nJakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok offers ferry connections. Tanjung Priok is Indonesia's busiest port, and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013, handling over 6.59 million TEUs. To boost port capacity, the two-phase 'New Tanjung Priok' extension project was undertaken. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple the existing capacity. Muara Angke port is used as a public port, while Ancol marina port is used as a tourist port to connect to the Thousand Islands.\n\nOn 6 June 2007, the city administration introduced the Waterway (officially \"Angkutan Sungai\"), a riverboat service along the Ciliwung River. However, because of varying water levels during the dry and wet seasons plastic garbage that came from upstream during heavy rain, this service was discontinued.\n\nJakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences. External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (\"Artocarpus integrifolia\") and comprise three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo. Additionally, a number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.\n\nColonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Bank Mandiri Museum.\nIn the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating an ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate. These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by P.A.J. Moojen.\n\nAfter independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts. The office tower Wisma 46 soars to a height of with 48 stories and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.\n\nThe urban construction booms continued in the 21st century. The Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD's in the Asia-Pacific region. According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed , which puts the city in the top 10 of world rankings. It has more buildings taller than 150 metres than any other Southeast Asian or Southern Hemisphere cities.\n\nMost landmarks, monuments and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during the Sukarno era, then completed in the Suharto era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the National Monument, Istiqlal mosque, the Legislature Building, and the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.\n\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the obelisk of the National Monument (\"Monumen Nasional\" or \"Monas\") in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the \"Selamat Datang\" monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout. Other landmarks include the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and the Immanuel Church. The former Batavia Stadhuis, Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. The Gama Tower building in South Jakarta is currently, at 310 metres, the tallest building in Indonesia.\n\nSome of statues and monuments are nationalist, such as the West Irian Liberation Monument, the Tugu Tani, the Youth statue and the . Some statues commemorate Indonesian national heroes, such as the Diponegoro and Kartini statues in Merdeka Square. The Sudirman and Thamrin statues are located on the streets bearing their names. There is also a statue of Sukarno and Hatta at the Proclamation Monument at the entrance to Soekarno–Hatta International Airport.\n\nIn June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (\"Ruang Terbuka Hijau\") although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces. There are about 300 integrated child-friendly public spaces (RPTRA) in the city in 2019. As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.\nBULLET::::- Merdeka Square () is an almost 1 km field housing the symbol of Jakarta, Monas or \"Monumen Nasional\" (National Monument). Until 2000, it was the world's largest city square. The square was created by Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1810) and was originally named \"Koningsplein\" (King's Square). On 10 January 1993, President Soeharto started the beautification of the square. Features including a deer park and 33 trees that represent the 33 provinces of Indonesia.\nBULLET::::- Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field) is located in Central Jakarta near Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral, and Jakarta Central Post Office. It covers about 4.5 hectares. Initially, it was called Waterlooplein and functioned as the ceremonial square during the colonial period. Colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the \"Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat\" (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s, the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993, the park was again turned into a public space. It became a recreation place for people and now serves as an exhibition place or for other events. 'Jakarta Flona' (\"Flora dan Fauna\"), a flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.\n\nBULLET::::- Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (Miniature Park of Indonesia), in East Jakarta, has ten mini parks.\nBULLET::::- Suropati Park is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta.

Jakarta International Equestrian Park is an equestrian sports venue located at Pulomas, which was also used as a venue for 2018 Asian Games.\nJakarta Car-Free Days are held weekly on Sunday on the main avenues of the city, Jalan Sudirman, and Jalan Thamrin, from 6 AM to 11 AM. The briefer Car-Free Day, which lasts from 6 AM to 9 AM, is held on every other Sunday. The event invites local pedestrians to do sports and exercise and have their activities on the streets that are usually full of cars and traffic. Along the road from the Senayan traffic circle on Jalan Sudirman, South Jakarta, to the \"Selamat Datang\" Monument at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle on Jalan Thamrin, north to the National Monument in Central Jakarta, cars are blocked from entering.

{"id": "16277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16277", "title": "Jack Ruby", "text": "Jack Ruby\n\nJack Leon Ruby (born Jacob Leon Rubenstein; April 25, 1911 – January 3, 1967) was a Dallas, Texas nightclub owner. He fatally shot Lee Harvey Oswald on November 24, 1963, while Oswald was in police custody after being charged with assassinating United States President John F. Kennedy and murdering Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit about an hour later. A Dallas jury found him guilty of murdering Oswald, and he was sentenced to death. Ruby's conviction was later appealed, and he was granted a new trial. However, as the date for his new trial was being set, Ruby became ill in prison and died of a pulmonary embolism from lung cancer on January 3, 1967.\n\nIn September 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald. Various groups believed Ruby was involved with major figures in organized crime and that he killed Oswald as part of an overall plot surrounding the assassination of Kennedy.\n\nJack Ruby was born Jacob Leon Rubenstein, on April 25, 1911, in the Maxwell Street area of Chicago the son of Joseph Rubenstein and Fannie Turek Rutkowski (or Rokowsky), both Polish-born Orthodox Jews from Sokołów. Ruby was the fifth of his parents' 10 surviving children. While he was growing up, his parents were often violent towards each other and regularly temporarily separated; Ruby's mother was eventually committed to a mental hospital. His troubled childhood and adolescence was marked by juvenile delinquency with time being spent in foster homes. At age 11 in 1922, he was arrested for truancy. Ruby eventually skipped school enough times that he spent time at the Institute for Juvenile Research. Still a young man, he sold horse-racing tip sheets and various novelties, then acted as a business agent for a local refuse collectors union that later became part of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT).\n\nFrom his early childhood, Ruby was nicknamed \"Sparky\" by those who knew him. His sister, Eva Grant, said that he acquired the nickname because he resembled a slow-moving horse named \"Spark Plug\" or \"Sparky\" in the contemporary comic strip Barney Google. (\"Spark Plug\" debuted as a character in the strip in 1922, when Ruby was 11.) Other accounts say that the name was given because of his quick temper. In either event, Grant stated that Ruby did not like the nickname Sparky, and was quick to fight anyone who called him that.\n\nIn the 1940s, Ruby frequented race tracks in Illinois and California. He was drafted in 1943 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases until 1946. He had an honorable record and was promoted to Private First Class. Upon discharge, in 1946, Ruby returned to Chicago.\n\nIn 1947, Ruby moved to Dallas where he and his brothers soon afterward shortened their surnames from Rubenstein to Ruby. The stated reason for this was that the name \"Rubenstein\" was too long and that he was \"well known\" as Jack Ruby. Ruby later went on to manage various nightclubs, strip clubs, and dance halls. He developed close ties to many Dallas Police officers who frequented his nightclubs, where he provided them with free liquor, prostitutes and other favors.\n\nRuby never married and he had no children.\n\nThere was evidence indicating Jack Ruby had been involved in the underworld activities of illegal gambling, narcotics, and prostitution.\n\nA 1956 FBI report stated that their informant, Eileen Curry, reported that in January of that year, she moved to Dallas with her boyfriend, James Breen, after jumping bond on narcotics charges. Breen told her that he had made connections with a large narcotics setup operating between Texas, Mexico, and the East, and that \"in some fashion, James got the okay to operate through Jack Ruby of Dallas.\"\nFormer Dallas County Sheriff Steve Guthrie told the FBI that he believed Ruby \"operated some prostitution activities and other vices in his club\" since living in Dallas.\nDallas disc jockey Kenneth Dowe testified that Ruby was known around the station for \"procuring women for different people who came to town.\"\n\nThe Warren Commission attempted to reconstruct Ruby's movements from November 21, 1963 through November 24. The Commission reported that he was attending to his duties as the proprietor of the Carousel Club located at 1312 1/2 Commerce St. in downtown Dallas and the Vegas Club in the city's Oak Lawn district from the afternoon of November 21 to the early hours of November 22.\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission, Ruby was in the second-floor advertising offices of the \"Dallas Morning News\", five blocks away from the Texas School Book Depository, placing weekly advertisements for his nightclubs when he learned of the assassination around 12:45 p.m. Ruby then made phone calls to his assistant at the Carousel Club and to his sister. The Commission stated that an employee of the \"Dallas Morning News\" estimated that Ruby left the newspaper's offices at 1:30 p.m., but indicated that other testimony suggested he may have left earlier.\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission, Ruby arrived back at the Carousel Club shortly before 1:45 p.m. to notify employees that the club would be closed that evening.\n\nRuby was seen in the halls of the Dallas Police Headquarters on several occasions after Lee Harvey Oswald's arrest on November 22, 1963. Newsreel footage from WFAA-TV (Dallas) and NBC shows that Ruby impersonated a newspaper reporter during a press conference at Dallas Police Headquarters on the night of Kennedy's death. District Attorney Henry Wade briefed reporters at the press conference telling them that Lee Oswald was a member of the anti-Castro Free Cuba Committee. Ruby was one of several people there who spoke up to correct Wade, saying, \"Henry, that's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\" a pro-Castro organization. One month after his arrest for killing Oswald, Ruby told the FBI that he had his loaded snub-nosed Colt Cobra .38 revolver in his right pocket during the press conference.\n\nOn November 24, Ruby drove into town with his pet dachshund Sheba (to whom he would often jokingly refer to as his \"wife\") to send an emergency money order at the Western Union on Main Street to one of his employees. The time stamp of completion for the cash transaction on the money order was 11:17 a.m. Ruby then walked one half block to the nearby Dallas police headquarters, where he made his way into the basement via either the Main Street ramp or a stairway accessible from an alleyway next to the Dallas Municipal Building. At 11:21 a.m. CST—while authorities were escorting Oswald through the police basement to an armored car that was to take him to the nearby county jail—Ruby stepped out from a crowd of reporters and fired a single round from his .38 Colt Cobra revolver into Oswald's abdomen at close range, fatally wounding him. The bullet entered Oswald's left side in the front part of the abdomen and caused damage to his spleen, stomach, aorta, vena cava, kidney, liver, diaphragm, and eleventh rib before coming to rest on his right side. As the shot rang out, a police detective suddenly recognized Ruby and exclaimed: \"Jack, you son of a bitch!\" Ruby was immediately subdued by agents and police. An unconscious Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital—the same hospital where President Kennedy was pronounced dead two days earlier. Oswald died at 1:07 p.m.\n\nA network television pool camera was broadcasting live to cover the transfer; millions of people watching on NBC witnessed the shooting as it happened and on other networks within minutes afterward. Several photographs were taken of the event just before, as, and after Ruby pulled the trigger. In 1964, Robert H. Jackson of the \"Dallas Times Herald\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his image of the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby.\n\nAfter his arrest, Ruby asked Dallas attorney Tom Howard to represent him. Howard accepted and asked Ruby if he could think of anything that might damage his defense. Ruby responded that there would be a problem if a man by the name of \"Davis\" should come up. Ruby told his attorney that he \"... had been involved with Davis, who was a gunrunner entangled in anti-Castro efforts\".\n\nLater, Ruby replaced attorney Tom Howard with prominent San Francisco defense attorney Melvin Belli, who agreed to represent Ruby \"pro bono\". On March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of murder with malice and was sentenced to death.\n\nRuby's conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on the grounds that \"an oral confession of premeditation made while in police custody\" should have been ruled inadmissible, because it violated a Texas criminal statute. The court also ruled that the venue should have been changed to a Texas county other than the one in which the high-profile crime had been committed. \nRuby died technically unconvicted, because his original conviction was overturned and his retrial was pending at the time of his death.\n\nDuring the six months following Kennedy's assassination, Ruby repeatedly asked, orally and in writing, to speak to the members of the Warren Commission. The commission initially showed no interest. Only after Ruby's sister Eileen wrote letters to the commission (and her letters became public) did the Warren Commission agree to talk to Ruby. In June 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren, then-Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, and other commission members went to Dallas to see Ruby. Ruby asked Warren several times to take him to Washington D.C., saying \"my life is in danger here\" and that he wanted an opportunity to make additional statements. He added: \"I want to tell the truth, and I can't tell it here.\" Warren told Ruby that he would be unable to comply, because many legal barriers would need to be overcome, and public interest in the situation would be too heavy. Warren also told Ruby that the commission would have no way of protecting him, since it had no police powers. Ruby said he wanted to convince President Lyndon Johnson that he was not part of any conspiracy to kill Kennedy.\n\nEventually, the appellate court agreed with Ruby's lawyers that he should be granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a change of venue before the original trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital in Dallas, suffering from pneumonia. A day later, doctors realized he had cancer in his liver, lungs, and brain. Three weeks later, he died.\n\nRuby died of a pulmonary embolism, secondary to bronchogenic carcinoma (lung cancer), on January 3, 1967, at Parkland Hospital, the same facility where Oswald had died and where President Kennedy had been pronounced dead after his assassination. He was buried beside his parents in the Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.\n\nThe Warren Commission found no evidence linking Ruby's killing of Oswald with any broader conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. In 1964, the Warren Commission provided a detailed biography of Ruby's life and activities to help ascertain whether he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy. The Commission indicated that there was not a \"significant link between Ruby and organized crime\" and said he acted independently in killing Oswald.\n\nWarren Commission investigator David Belin said that postal inspector Harry Holmes arrived unannounced at the Dallas police station and, upon invitation by the investigators, questioned Oswald, thus delaying his transfer by half an hour. Belin concluded that, had Ruby been part of a conspiracy, he would have been downtown 30 minutes earlier.\n\nIn Gerald Posner's book \"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK\", Ruby's friends, relatives and associates claimed that he was upset over President Kennedy's death, even crying on occasions and closing his clubs for three days as a mark of respect. They also disputed the conspiracy claims, saying that Ruby's connection with gangsters was minimal at most and that he was not the sort to be entrusted with such an act within a high-level conspiracy.\n\nDallas reporter Tony Zoppi, who knew Ruby well, claimed that one \"would have to be crazy\" to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he \"couldn't keep a secret for five minutes ... Jack was one of the most talkative guys you would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, because he just plain talked too much.\" He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at \"the center of attention\", trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.\n\nSome writers, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, dismiss Ruby's connections to organized crime as being highly minimal: \"It is very noteworthy that without exception, not one of these conspiracy theorists knew or had ever met Jack Ruby. Without our even resorting to his family and roommate, all of whom think the suggestion of Ruby being connected to the mob is ridiculous, those who knew him, unanimously and without exception, think the notion of his being connected to the Mafia, and then killing Oswald for them, is nothing short of laughable.\"\n\nBill Alexander, who prosecuted Ruby for Oswald's murder, equally rejected any suggestions that Ruby was part-and-parcel of organized crime, claiming that conspiracy theorists based it on the claim that \"A knew B, and Ruby knew B back in 1950, so he must have known A, and that must be the link to the conspiracy.\"\n\nRuby's brother Earl denied allegations that Jack was involved in racketeering Chicago nightclubs, and author Gerald Posner suggested that witnesses may have confused Ruby with Harry Rubenstein, a convicted Chicago felon. Entertainment reporter Tony Zoppi was also dismissive of mob ties. He knew Ruby and described him as a \"born loser\".\n\nAuthor Norman Mailer and others have questioned why Ruby would have left his two beloved dogs in his car if he had planned on killing Oswald at police headquarters.\n\nSome critics have not accepted the conclusions of the Warren Commission and have proposed several other theories.\nRuby was arrested immediately after shooting Oswald, and he told several witnesses that he had been distraught over President Kennedy's death and had helped the city of Dallas \"redeem\" itself in the eyes of the public, and that his motive for killing Oswald was \"saving Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial\". He also claimed he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so. Ruby told the FBI he was \"in mourning\" Friday and Saturday. He said he cried when he heard the President was shot, \"cried a great deal\" Saturday afternoon and was depressed Saturday night. He explained that this grief was caused by his great love for the President and his sympathy for the Kennedy family. The anguish over the assassination, Ruby stated, finally \"reached the point of insanity\", suddenly compelling him to shoot when Oswald walked to the police ramp that Sunday morning. At the time of the shooting, Ruby said he was taking phenmetrazine, a central nervous system stimulant. Ruby broke into tears at his bond hearing in January 1964, as he talked to reporters regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. His voice breaking, Ruby said that he could not understand \"how a great man like that could be lost\". According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19, 1966, that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. \"There is nothing to hide ... There was no one else,\" Ruby said.\n\nWhite House correspondent Seth Kantor, who was a passenger in President Kennedy's motorcade, testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while doctors were trying to save the President's life. Kantor said that as he entered the hospital, at about 1:30 p.m., he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby, who called him by his first name and shook his hand; he said that he had become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the \"Dallas Times Herald\" newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.\n\nThe Warren Commission dismissed Kantor's testimony, saying that the encounter at Parkland Hospital would have had to take place in a span of a few minutes before and after 1:30 pm, as evidenced by telephone company records of calls made by both people then. The Commission also pointed to contradictory witness testimony and to the lack of video confirmation of Ruby at the scene. The Commission concluded that \"Kantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital\" and \"may have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw Ruby\".\n\nIn 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations reexamined Kantor's testimony and stated, \"While the Warren Commission concluded that Kantor was mistaken [about his Parkland encounter with Ruby], the Committee determined he probably was not.\"\n\nKantor also reported that Ruby might have tampered with evidence while at Parkland. Goaded by the Warren Commission's dismissal of his testimony, Kantor researched the Ruby case for years. In a later published book \"Who Was Jack Ruby?\", Kantor wrote:\n\nThe mob was Ruby's \"friend.\" And Ruby could well have been paying off an IOU the day he was used to kill Lee Harvey Oswald. Remember: \"I have been used for a purpose,\" the way Ruby expressed it to Chief Justice Warren in their June 7, 1964 session. It would not have been hard for the mob to maneuver Ruby through the ranks of a few negotiable police [to kill Oswald].\n\nThe House Select Committee on Assassinations, in its 1979 Final Report, opined:\n\n... Ruby's shooting of Oswald was not a spontaneous act, in that it involved at least some premeditation. Similarly, the committee believed it was less likely that Ruby entered the police basement without assistance, even though the assistance may have been provided with no knowledge of Ruby's intentions ... The committee was troubled by the apparently unlocked doors along the stairway route and the removal of security guards from the area of the garage nearest the stairway shortly before the shooting ... There is also evidence that the Dallas Police Department withheld relevant information from the Warren Commission concerning Ruby's entry to the scene of the Oswald transfer.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Billy Grammer, a dispatcher for the Dallas Police Department, he received an anonymous phone call at 3 a.m. on November 24 from a man who knew Grammer's name. The caller told Grammer that he knew of the plan to move Oswald from the basement and that unless the plans for Oswald's transfer were changed, the caller warned \"we are going to kill him\". After Oswald was shot, Grammer, who knew Ruby, and found the voice familiar at the time of the call, identified Ruby as the caller. Grammer remained convinced that Ruby's shooting of Oswald was \"a planned event\".\n\nDetective Archer testified to the Warren Commission that when he searched Jack Ruby after his arrest, he was worried about Oswald's condition and he said to Ruby, \"Jack, I think you killed him.\" Archer said that Ruby looked him straight in the eye and said, \"Well, I intended to shoot him three times.\" Seth Kantor believes that Ruby's response to Archer does not suggest a spontaneous reaction, and the very word \"intended\" implies having prior intention.\n\nRuby's explanation for killing Oswald would be \"exposed ... as a fabricated legal ploy\", according to the House Select Committee on Assassinations. In a private note to one of his attorneys, Joseph Tonahill, Ruby wrote: \"Joe, you should know this. My first lawyer Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?\"\n\nG. Robert Blakey, chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations from 1977 to 1979, said: \"The most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby was that Ruby had stalked him on behalf of organized crime, trying to reach him on at least three occasions in the forty-eight hours before he silenced him forever.\"\n\nIn his testimony before the Warren Commission, Russell Lee Moore Knight said that Ruby held no bitterness towards Oswald and called him \"a good looking guy\" who resembled Paul Newman.\n\nIn his book \"Contract on America\", David Scheim presented evidence that although some people claimed that they saw Ruby upset over the weekend of the assassination, others said that he was not. On Friday night, TV newsman Vic Robertson Jr. saw Ruby at police headquarters and reported that Ruby \"appeared to be anything but under stress or strain. He seemed happy, jovial, was joking and laughing\". Announcer Glen Duncan also testified that Ruby \"was not grieving\" and if anything, was \"happy that evidence was piling up against Oswald\".\n\nScheim also presented evidence that he claimed showed that Ruby made several \"candid confession(s)\" when giving testimony to the Warren Commission. Scheim asserted that Ruby teared up when talking about a Saturday morning eulogy for President Kennedy, but after composing himself, inexplicably said, \"I must be a great actor, I tell you that.\" Ruby also was claimed to have remarked that \"they didn't ask me another question: \"If I loved the President so much, why wasn't I at the parade?\"\" (referring to the presidential motorcade) and \"it's strange that perhaps I didn't vote for President Kennedy, or didn't vote at all, that I should build up such a great affection for him\".\n\nJada, a stripper at Ruby's club, in an interview with ABC's Paul Good: \"I believe he disliked Bobby Kennedy\".\n\nSchiem also noted several people who knew Ruby, who claimed that the patriotic statements Ruby professed were quite out of character. Harry Hall, Ruby's partner in a gambling operation, told the FBI that \"Ruby was the type who was interested in any way to make money\" and also said that he \"could not conceive of Ruby doing anything out of patriotism\". Jack Kelly, who had known Ruby casually since 1943, \"scoffed at the idea of a patriotic motive being involved by Ruby in the slaying of Oswald\", and reportedly stated that he \"could not see Ruby\" killing Oswald \"out of patriotism\" but \"for publicity\nor ... for money\".\n\nRuby's friend Paul Roland Jones was paraphrased by his FBI interviewers as affirming that:\n\nfrom his acquaintance with Ruby he doubted that he would have become emotionally upset and killed Oswald on the spur of the moment. He felt Ruby would have done it for money.\n\nFollowing Ruby's March 1964 conviction for murder with malice, Ruby's lawyers, led by Sam Houston Clinton, appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in Texas. Ruby's lawyers argued that he could not have received a fair trial in Dallas because of the excessive publicity surrounding the case. A year after his conviction, in March 1965, Ruby conducted a brief televised news conference in which he stated: \"Everything pertaining to what's happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts of what occurred, my motives. The people who had so much to gain, and had such an ulterior motive for putting me in the position I'm in, will never let the true facts come above board to the world.\" When asked by a reporter, \"Are these people in very high positions, Jack?\", he responded \"Yes.\"\n\nJournalist Seth Kantor speculated in 1978 that the man by the name of \"Davis\" that Ruby mentioned may have been Thomas Eli Davis III, a CIA-connected mercenary.\n\nDallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: \"Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they injected me for a cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's what he told me, Ruby did. I said you don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [Then] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel a piece of paper in his palm ... [In this note] he said it was a conspiracy and he said ... if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him.\" In the note, Ruby claimed he was part of a conspiracy, and that his role was to silence Oswald.\nNot long before Ruby died, according to an article in the London \"Sunday Times\", he told psychiatrist Werner Teuter that the assassination was \"an act of overthrowing the government\" and that he knew \"who had President Kennedy killed\". He added: \"I am doomed. I do not want to die. But I am not insane. I was framed to kill Oswald.\"\n\nIn his book, \"Contract on America\", David Scheim presented evidence that Mafia leaders Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante, Jr., as well as organized labor leader Jimmy Hoffa, ordered the assassination of President Kennedy. Scheim cited in particular a 25-fold increase in the number of out-of-state telephone calls from Jack Ruby to associates of these crime bosses in the months before the assassination. According to author Vincent Bugliosi, both the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations determined all of these calls were related to Ruby seeking help from the American Guild of Variety Artists in a matter concerning two of his competitors. The House Select Committee on Assassinations report stated \"... that most of Ruby's phone calls during late 1963 were related to his labor troubles. In the light of the identity of some of the individuals with whom Ruby spoke, however, the possibility of other matters being discussed could not be dismissed.\"\n\nIn his memoir, \"Bound by Honor\", Bill Bonanno, son of New York Mafia boss Joseph Bonanno, stated that he realized that certain Mafia families were involved in the JFK assassination when Ruby killed Oswald, since Bonanno was aware that Ruby was an associate of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.\n\nIn 1979, fifteen years after the Warren report, the House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook a similar investigation of Ruby and said that he \"had a significant number of associations and direct and indirect contacts with underworld figures\" and \"the Dallas criminal element\" but that he was not a \"member\" of organized crime.\n\nRuby was known to have been acquainted with both the police and the Mafia. The HSCA said that Ruby had known Chicago mobster Sam Giancana (1908–1975) and Joseph Campisi (1918–1990) since 1947, and had been seen with them on many occasions. After an investigation of Joe Campisi, the HSCA found:\n\nWhile Campisi's technical characterization in federal law enforcement records as an organized crime member has ranged from definite to suspected to negative, it is clear that he was an associate or friend of many Dallas-based organized crime members, particularly Joseph Civello, during the time he was the head of the Dallas organization. There was no indication that Campisi had engaged in any specific organized crime-related activities.\n\nSimilarly, a PBS \"Frontline\" investigation into the connections between Ruby and Dallas organized crime figures reported the following:\n\nIn 1963, Sam and Joe Campisi were leading figures in the Dallas underworld. Jack knew the Campisis and had been seen with them on many occasions. The Campisis were lieutenants of Carlos Marcello, the Mafia boss who had reportedly talked of killing the President.\n\nA day before Kennedy was assassinated, Ruby went to Joe Campisi's restaurant. At the time of the Kennedy assassination, Ruby was close enough to the Campisis to ask them to come see him after he was arrested for shooting Lee Oswald. Joe Campisi and his wife visited with Jack Ruby in jail for ten minutes on November 30, 1963.\n\nHoward P. Willens—the third-highest official in the Department of Justice and assistant counsel to J. Lee Rankin—helped organize the Warren Commission. Willens also outlined the Commission's investigative priorities and terminated an investigation of Ruby's Cuban related activities. An FBI report states that Willens's father had been Tony Accardo's next door neighbor going back to 1958. In 1946, Tony Accardo allegedly asked Jack Ruby to go to Texas with Mafia associates Pat Manno and Romie Nappi to make sure that Dallas County Sheriff Steve Gutherie would acquiesce to the Mafia's expansion into Dallas.\n\nFour years before the assassination of President Kennedy, Ruby went to see a man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba. Ruby considered McWillie, who had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, to be one of his closest friends. At the time Ruby visited him, in August 1959, McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana's Tropicana Club. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The House Select Committee on Assassinations would later conclude that Ruby \"... most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests\". The committee also found \"circumstantial,\" but not conclusive, evidence that \"... Ruby met with [Mafia boss] Santo Trafficante in Cuba sometime in 1959.\"\n\nJames E. Beaird, who claimed to be a poker-playing friend of Jack Ruby, told both \"The Dallas Morning News\" and the FBI that Ruby smuggled guns and ammunition from Galveston Bay, Texas to Fidel Castro's guerrillas in Cuba in the late 1950s. Beaird said that Ruby \"was in it for the money. It wouldn't matter which side, just [whichever] one that would pay him the most.\" Beaird said that the guns were stored in a two-story house near the waterfront, and that he saw Ruby and his associates load \"many boxes of new guns, including automatic rifles and handguns\" on a 50-foot military-surplus boat. He claimed that \"each time that the boat left with guns and ammunition, Jack Ruby was on the boat.\"\n\nBlaney Mack Johnson, an FBI informant, said Ruby was \"active in arranging illegal flights of weapons from Miami\" to pro-Castro forces in Cuba in the early 1950s.\n\nArticles of clothing that Ruby wore when he killed Oswald—including his suit, hat and shoes—are on display at the Historic Auto Attractions museum in Roscoe, Illinois.\n\nBULLET::::- Tom Skerritt's \"Fighting Back\" has footage of his shooting of Oswald in its opening credits news special on violence.\nBULLET::::- In Oliver Stone's 1991 film \"JFK\", Ruby was portrayed by actor Brian Doyle-Murray. Stone's perspective on events draws heavily from conspiracy theory researchers such as Jim Marrs and L. Fletcher Prouty. At least three scenes further detailing Ruby were removed from the film and are only available on DVD. One scene expanded on the Oswald shooting by showing corrupt Dallas police officers allowing Ruby to enter police headquarters through a restricted entrance.\nBULLET::::- The 1992 film \"Ruby\" speculated on complex motivations that might have propelled Ruby into shooting Oswald. Among these were Ruby's reputation among family and friends as an assiduous, emotionally volatile publicity-seeker, and the influence of his long-time organized crime and Dallas police connections.

{"id": "16278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16278", "title": "James Randi", "text": "James Randi\n\nJames Randi (born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge; August 7, 1928) is a Canadian-American retired stage magician and a scientific skeptic who has extensively challenged paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. Randi is the co-founder of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), originally known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). He is also the founder of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). He began his career as a magician under the stage name The Amazing Randi and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, occult, and supernatural claims, which he collectively calls \"woo-woo\". Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from the JREF at 87.\n\nAlthough often referred to as a \"debunker\", Randi has said he dislikes the term's connotations and prefers to describe himself as an \"investigator\". He has written about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", famously exposing fraudulent faith healer Peter Popoff, and was occasionally featured on the television program \"\"\n\nBefore Randi's retirement, JREF sponsored the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which offered a prize of one million dollars US to eligible applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties. The paranormal challenge was officially terminated by the JREF in 2015. The foundation continues to make grants to non-profit groups that encourage critical thinking and a fact-based world view.\n\nRandi was born on August 7, 1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Marie Alice (née Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge. He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again. Randi often skipped classes and, at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow. He practised as a mentalist in local nightclubs and at Toronto's Canadian National Exhibition and wrote for Montreal's tabloid press.\n\nIn his twenties, Randi posed as an astrologer and, to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks, he briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid \"Midnight\" under the name \"Zo-ran\" by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column. In his thirties, Randi worked in the UK, Europe, Philippine nightclubs, and all across Japan. He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural. One of his earliest reported experiences is that of seeing an evangelist using a version of the \"one-ahead\" technique to convince churchgoers of his divine powers.\n\nThough defining himself as a conjuror, Randi began a career as a professional stage magician and escapologist in 1946. Initially, he presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of \"The Amazing Randi\". Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on NBC's \"Today\" show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be Harry Houdini's record of 93 minutes, though Randi calls attention to the fact that he was very much younger than Houdini when the original record was established, in 1926.\n\nRandi was a frequent guest on the Long John Nebel program on New York radio station WOR, and did character voices for commercials. After Nebel went to WNBC in 1962, Randi was given the time slot, and from 1967 to '68 hosted \"The Amazing Randi Show\". This show often had guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend James W. Moseley. Randi says he quit WOR over complaints (disputed by Randi) from the archbishop of New York, that Randi had said on-air that \"Jesus Christ was a religious nut.\"\n\nRandi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As \"The Amazing Randi\" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series \"Wonderama\" from 1959 to 1967. He also auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children's show \"The Magic Clown\" in 1970, which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up. In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine \"Abracadabra\", Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated: \"I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours.\" In the December 2003 issue of \"The Linking Ring\", the monthly publication of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, it is stated: \"Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing\" and \"The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk.\"\n\nDuring Alice Cooper's 1973–1974 Billion Dollar Babies tour, Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Alice's executioner. He also built several of the stage props, including the guillotine. Shortly after that, in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special \"World of Wizards\", Randi escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls.\n\nRandi has been accused of actually using \"psychic powers\" to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: \"Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery.\" The professor shouted back: \"That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.\" A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: \"I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it.\" Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.\n\nRandi is a member of the Society of American Magicians (SAM), the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), and The Magic Circle in the UK, holding the rank of \"Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star.\"\n\nRandi said the hardest people to fool are not the highly educated, but children, because they are not sophisticated enough to be fooled, as they have not learned the body cues that adults have learned and which magicians take advantage of.\n\nRandi is the author of ten books, among them \"Conjuring\" (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled \"Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!\" The book's cover says that it is by \"James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed\". The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book titled \"Houdini, His Life and Art\". This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.\n\nRandi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled \"The Magic World of the Amazing Randi\", which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on \"A Magician in the Laboratory\", which recounts his application of skepticism to science. He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of his good friend Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.\n\nOther books are \"Flim-Flam!\" (1982), \"The Faith Healers\" (1987), \"James Randi, Psychic Investigator\" (1991), \"Test Your ESP Potential\" (1982) and \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995).\n\nRandi was a regular contributor to \"Skeptic\" magazine, penning the \"'Twas Brillig ...\" column, and also served on its editorial board. He is also a frequent contributor to \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, which is published by CSI, of which he is also a Fellow.\n\nRandi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of Uri Geller. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a charlatan and a fraud who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book \"The Truth About Uri Geller\" (1982).\n\nBelieving that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and CSICOP reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a \"very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days.\" During this effort, Randi made contact with Johnny Carson and discovered that he was \"very much on our side. He wasn't only a comedian ... he was a great thinker.\" According to Randi, when he was on \"The Tonight Show\", Carson broke his usual protocol of not talking with guests before their entrance on stage, but instead would ask what Randi wanted to be emphasized in the interview. \"He wanted to be aware of how he could help me.\"\n\nIn 1973, Geller appeared on \"The Tonight Show\", and this appearance is recounted in the \"Nova\" documentary \"Secrets of the Psychics\".\n\nIn the documentary, Randi says that Carson \"had been a magician himself and was skeptical\" of Geller's claimed paranormal powers, so before the date of taping, Randi was asked \"to help prevent any trickery\". Per Randi's advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff \"anywhere near them\". When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said \"This scares me\" and \"I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.\" Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying \"I don't feel strong\" and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being \"pressed\" to perform by Carson. According to Adam Higginbotham's Nov. 7, 2014 article in the \"New York Times\":\n\nHowever, this appearance on \"The Tonight Show\", which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,\n\nAccording to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached Ray Hyman, a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller's ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. Later that same year, together with Martin Gardner, a \"Scientific American\" columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman's and Randi's skepticism, they formed the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).\n\nUsing donations and sales of their magazine, \"Skeptical Inquirer\", they and secular humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz took seats on the executive board, with Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan joining as founding members. Randi traveled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.\n\nAndrás G. Pintér, producer and co-host of the European Skeptics Podcast called Randi the grandfather of European skepticism by virtue of Randi \"playing a role in kickstarting several European organizations.\"\n\nGeller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million in 1991 and lost. Geller's suit against CSICOP was thrown out in 1995, and he was ordered to pay $120,000 for filing a frivolous lawsuit. The legal costs Randi incurred used almost all of a $272,000 MacArthur Foundation grant awarded to Randi in 1986 for his work. Randi also dismissed Geller's claims that he was capable of the kind of psychic photography made famous by the case of Ted Serios. It is a matter, Randi argues, of trick photography using a simple hand-held optical device. During the period of Geller's legal dispute, CSICOP's leadership, wanting to avoid becoming a target of Geller's litigation, demanded that Randi refrain from commenting on Geller. Randi refused and resigned, though he has maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.\n\nRandi has gone on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal. He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his Project Alpha hoax, Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment. The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level.\n\nRandi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on \"That's My Line\", Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick \"confessed everything\".\n\nRandi was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including W. V. Grant, Ernest Angley, and Peter Popoff, whom Randi first exposed on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out \"prayer cards\" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.\n\nThe news coverage generated by Randi's exposé on \"The Tonight Show\" led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987. However, the televangelist returned soon after with faith-healing infomercials that reportedly attracted more than $23 million in 2005 from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's \"Think Again! TV\" documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in Toronto on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.\n\nIn February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's \"60 Minutes\" program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a \"spirit channeler\" named Carlos, who was actually artist José Alvarez, Randi's partner. While performing as Carlos, Alvarez was prompted by Randi using sophisticated radio equipment. According to the \"60 Minutes\" program on the Carlos hoax, \"it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)\", though an analysis by \"The Skeptic\"'s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, the hoax \"at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical\". The hoax was exposed on \"60 Minutes Australia\"; \"Carlos\" and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.\n\nIn his book \"The Faith Healers\", Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arose from compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi has also been critical of João de Deus (John of God), a self-proclaimed psychic surgeon who has received international attention. Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, \"To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious.\"\nIn 1982, Randi verified the abilities of Arthur Lintgen, a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a vinyl LP solely by examining the grooves on the record. However, Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.\n\nIn 1988, John Maddox, editor of the prominent science journal \"Nature\", asked Randi to join the supervision and observation of the homeopathy experiments conducted by Jacques Benveniste's team. Once Randi's stricter protocol for the experiment was in place, the positive results could not be reproduced.\nJames Randi stated that Daniel Dunglas Home, who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a one-octave mouth organ concealed under Home's large moustache and that other one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death. According to Randi, author William Lindsay Gresham told Randi \"around 1960\" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). Eric J. Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, \"It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public.\"\n\nRandi distinguishes between pseudoscience and crackpot science. He regards most of parapsychology as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached and conducted, but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate subject that \"should be pursued\", and from which real scientific discoveries may develop. Randi regards crackpot science as \"equally wrong\" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.\n\nDespite multiple debunkings, Randi didn't like to be called a \"debunker\", preferring to call himself a \"skeptic\" or an \"investigator”: \n\nSkeptics and magicians Penn & Teller credit Randi and his career as a skeptic for their own careers. During an interview at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that \"Flim-Flam!\" was an early influence on him, and said \"If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today.\" He went on to say \"Outside of my family ... no one is more important in my life. Randi is everything to me.\"\n\nAt the NECSS skeptic conference in 2017, Randi was asked by George Hrab what a \"'skeptic coming of age ceremony' would look like\" and Randi talked about what it was like as a child to learn about the speed of light and how that felt like he was looking into the past. Randi stated \"More kids need to be stunned\".\n\nAt The Amaz!ng Meeting in 2011 (TAM 9) the Independent Investigations Group (IIG) organised a tribute to James Randi. The group gathered together with other attendees, put on fake white beards, and posed for a large group photo with Randi. At the CSICon in 2017, in absence of Randi, the IIG organised another group photo with leftover beards from the 2011 photo. After Randi was sent the photo, he replied, \"I'm always very touched by any such expression. This is certainly no exception. You have my sincere gratitude. I suspect, however that a couple of those beards were fake. But I'm in a forgiving mood at the moment. I'm frankly very touched. I'll see you at the next CSICon. Thank you all.\"\n\n\"Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live\" was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor Bill Bixby, the program offered $100,000 (Randi's then $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's syndicator, LBS Communications, Inc.) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.\n\nBULLET::::- An astrologer, Joseph Meriwether, claimed that he was able to ascertain a person's astrological sign after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell Meriwether their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After Meriwether talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that he thought was theirs. By agreement, Meriwether needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.\nBULLET::::- The next psychic, Barbara Martin, claimed to be able to read auras around people, claiming that auras were visible at least five inches above each person. She selected ten people from a group of volunteers who she said had clearly visible auras. On stage were erected ten screens, numbered \"1\" through \"10\", just tall enough to hide the volunteer while not hiding their aura. Unseen by Martin, some of the volunteers positioned themselves behind different screens, then she was invited to predict which screens hid volunteers by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, Martin needed to get eight of the ten right. She stated that she saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.\nBULLET::::- A dowser, Forrest Bayes, claimed that he could detect water, even in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box. He was shown twenty boxes and asked to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight of the boxes, which he said contained water, but it turned out that only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.\nBULLET::::- A psychometric psychic, Sharon McLaren-Straz, claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object by handling the object itself. In order to avoid ambiguous statements, the psychic agreed to be presented with both a watch and a key from each of twelve different people. She was to match keys and watches to each owner. According to the prior agreement, she had to match at least nine out of the twelve sets, but she succeeded in only two.\nBULLET::::- Professional crystal healer Valerie Swan attempted to use ESP to identify 250 Zener cards, guessing which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that Swan had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, she was able to get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.\n\nIn 1996, Randi established the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, \"Swift\". Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the one-seventh area triangle, a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.\n\nBeginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted The Amaz!ng Meeting, a gathering of scientists, skeptics, and atheists. The last meeting was in 2015, coinciding with Randi's retirement from the JREF.\n\nJames Randi began a series of conferences known as \"The Amazing Meeting\" (TAM) which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted a large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast \"Skepticality\" and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast \"Point of Inquiry\". From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast with a column titled \"Randi Speaks.\" In addition, \"The Amazing Show\" is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format.\n\nIn 2014, Part2Filmworks released \"An Honest Liar\", a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga), to whom he was married in 2013. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It also received positive reviews from critics. The film was featured on the PBS \"Independent Lens\" series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with.\n\nSince 2013, Randi has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nRandi's parents were members of the Anglican Church but rarely attended services. He attended Sunday School at St. Cuthbert's Church in Toronto a few times as a child, but he independently decided to stop going when he was not answered when he asked for proof of the teachings of the Church.\n\nIn his essay \"Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright\", Randi, who identifies himself as an atheist, opined that many accounts in religious texts, including the virgin birth, the miracles of Jesus Christ, and the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, are not believable. Randi refers to the Virgin Mary as being \"impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes\" and questions how Adam and Eve \"could have two sons, one of whom killed the other, and yet managed to populate the Earth without committing incest\". He wrote that, compared to the Bible, \"\"The Wizard of Oz\" is more believable. And much more fun.\"\n\nClarifying his view of atheism, Randi wrote \"I've said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that's their preference, and they've read it in a book. That's their right.\"\n\nIn \"An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural\" (1995), he examines various spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of Guru Maharaj Ji, he writes \"Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret.\" In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nIn a discussion with Kendrick Frazier at CSICon 2016, Randi stated \"I think that a belief in a deity is ... an unprovable claim ... and a rather ridiculous claim. It is an easy way out to explain things to which we have no answer.\" He then summarized his current concern with religious belief as follows:\n\nThe James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under scientific testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of John Nevil Maskelyne and Houdini, the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal. The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules. No one progressed past the preliminary test, which was set up with parameters agreed to by both Randi and the applicant. He refused to accept any challengers who might suffer serious injury or death as a result of the testing.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.\n\nOn \"Larry King Live\", March 6, 2001, Larry King asked claimed medium Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed. Randi appeared with Browne on \"Larry King Live\" six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge. However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.\n\nDuring a subsequent appearance on \"Larry King Live\" on June 5, 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea, another claimed medium, to undergo testing for the million dollars, but Altea refused to address the question. Instead Altea replied only, \"I agree with what he says, that there are many, many people who claim to be spiritual mediums, they claim to talk to the dead. There are many people, we all know this. There are cheats and charlatans everywhere.\" On January 26, 2007, Altea and Randi again appeared on the show, and Altea again refused to answer whether or not she would take the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge.\n\nIn October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward appeared on \"Headline Prime\", hosted by Glenn Beck. When asked if he would take \"\"the Amazing Randi's\"\" challenge, Edward responded, \"It's funny. I was on \"Larry King Live\" once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?\" Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.\n\nRandi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus ADE 651 bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008. Randi called the ADE 651 \"a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money. It's a fake, a scam, a swindle, and a blatant fraud. Prove me wrong and take the million dollars.\" There was no response from McCormick. According to Iraqi investigators, the ADE 651, which was corruptly sold to the Baghdad bomb squad, was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians who died as a result of terrorist bombs which were not detected at checkpoints. On April 23, 2013, McCormick was convicted of three counts of fraud at the Old Bailey in London; he was subsequently sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for his part in the ADE 651 scandal, which Randi was the first to expose.\n\nA public log of past participants in the Million Dollar Challenge exists.\nIn 2015, the James Randi paranormal challenge was officially terminated.\n\nRandi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has \"never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me.\" However, he says, he has paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.\n\nRandi met magician Uri Geller in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be \"Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome — everything!\" But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud. According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one-third of one percent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.\n\nIn May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the \"International Herald Tribune\" that Geller had \"tricked even reputable scientists\" with stunts that \"are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes\", referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller's lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay before the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.\n\nGeller sued both Randi and CSICOP. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. The matter was subsequently settled out of court, and the details of the settlement have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.\n\nIn 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a \"shopping market molester\" in a 1988 speech. However, the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister-in-law. The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case, CSICOP.\n\nLate in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley. Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on Usenet. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of \"alcohol toxicity.\"\n\nAllison DuBois, on whose life the television series \"Medium\" was based, threatened Randi with legal action for using a photo of her from her website in his December 17, 2004, commentary without her permission. Randi removed the photo and subsequently used a caricature of DuBois when mentioning her on his site, beginning with his December 23, 2005, commentary.\n\nSniffex, producer of a dowsing bomb detection device, sued Randi and the JREF in 2007 and lost. Sniffex sued Randi for his comments regarding a government test in which the Sniffex device failed. The company was later investigated and charged with fraud.\n\nWhen he hosted his own radio show in the 1960s, Randi lived in a small house in Rumson, New Jersey, that featured a sign on the premises that read: \"Randi — Charlatan\". In a Fort Lauderdale public library in 1986, Randi, who had recently moved to Florida, met Venezuelan artist José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga). They eventually moved in together, and were married in Washington on July 2, 2013, with Randi turning 85 the next month. They live in Plantation, Florida.\n\nIn 1987, Randi became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Randi has said that one reason he became an American citizen was an incident while he was on tour with Alice Cooper where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched the band's lockers during a performance. Nothing illicit or illegal was found, yet the RCMP trashed the room.\n\nIn February 2006, Randi underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. In early February 2006, he was declared to be in stable condition and \"receiving excellent care\" with his recovery proceeding well. The weekly commentary updates to his Web site were made by guests while he was hospitalized. Randi recovered after his surgery and was able to help organize and attend the 2007 Amaz!ng Meeting (T.A.M.) in Las Vegas, Nevada, his annual convention of scientists, magicians, skeptics, atheists and freethinkers.\n\nRandi was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in June 2009. He had a series of small tumors removed from his intestines during laparoscopic surgery. He announced the diagnosis a week later at The Amaz!ng Meeting 7, as well as the fact that he was scheduled to begin chemotherapy in the following weeks. He also said at the conference: \"One day, I'm gonna die. That's all there is to it. Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such—I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter.\"\n\nRandi underwent his final chemotherapy session on December 31, 2009, later saying that his chemotherapy experience was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be. In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated that he had been given a clean bill of health.\n\nIn a March 21, 2010, blog entry, Randi came out as gay, a move he said was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film \"Milk\".\n\nIn the 1993 documentary \"Secrets of the Psychics\", Randi stated, \"I've never involved myself in narcotics of any kind; I don't smoke; I don't drink, because that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world, as close as I can get to it\".\n\nIn a video released on October 16, 2017, Randi revealed that he had recently suffered a minor stroke, and that he was under medical advice not to travel during his recovery, so would be unable to attend CSICon 2017 in Las Vegas later that month.\n\nRandi is a registered Democrat. \n\n!

{"id": "16279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16279", "title": "James Lind", "text": "James Lind\n\nJames Lind (4 October 1716 – 13 July 1794) was a Scottish doctor. He was a pioneer of naval hygiene in the Royal Navy. By conducting one of the first ever clinical trials, he developed the theory that citrus fruits cured scurvy. He argued for the health benefits of better ventilation aboard naval ships, the improved cleanliness of sailors' bodies, clothing and bedding, and below-deck fumigation with sulphur and arsenic. He also proposed that fresh water could be obtained by distilling sea water. His work advanced the practice of preventive medicine and improved nutrition.\n\nLind was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1716 into a family of merchants, then headed by his father, James Lind. He had an elder sister. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1731 he began his medical studies as an apprentice of George Langlands, a fellow of the Incorporation of Surgeons which preceded the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In 1739, he entered the Navy as a surgeon's mate, serving in the Mediterranean, off the coast of West Africa and in the West Indies. By 1747 he had become surgeon of in the Channel Fleet, and conducted his experiment on scurvy while that ship was patrolling the Bay of Biscay. Just after that patrol he left the Navy, wrote his MD thesis on venereal diseases and earned his degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, and was granted a licence to practice in Edinburgh.\n\nScurvy is a disease now known to be caused by a vitamin C deficiency, but in Lind's day, the concept of vitamins was unknown. Vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance of healthy connective tissue. In 1740 the catastrophic result of Anson's circumnavigation attracted much attention in Europe; out of 1900 men, 1400 had died, most of them allegedly from having contracted scurvy. According to Lind, scurvy caused more deaths in the British fleets than French and Spanish arms.\n\nSince antiquity in various parts of the world, and since the 17th century in England, it had been known that citrus fruit had an antiscorbutic effect, when John Woodall (1570–1643), an English military surgeon of the British East India Company recommended them but their use did not become widespread. Although Lind was not the first to suggest citrus fruit as a cure for scurvy, he was the first to study their effect by a systematic experiment in 1747. It ranks as one of the first reported, controlled, clinical experiments in the history of medicine, particularly for its use of control groups.\n\nLind thought that scurvy was due to putrefaction of the body which could be helped by acids, and thus included a dietary supplement of an acidic quality in the experiment. This began after two months at sea when the ship was afflicted with scurvy. He divided twelve scorbutic sailors into six groups of two. They all received the same diet but, in addition, group one was given a quart of cider daily, group two twenty-five drops of elixir of vitriol (sulfuric acid), group three six spoonfuls of vinegar, group four half a pint of seawater, group five received two oranges and one lemon, and the last group a spicy paste plus a drink of barley water. The treatment of group five stopped after six days when they ran out of fruit, but by that time one sailor was fit for duty while the other had almost recovered. Apart from that, only group one also showed some effect of its treatment.\n\nShortly after this experiment Lind retired from the Navy and at first practised privately as a doctor. In 1753, he published \"A treatise of the scurvy\", which was virtually ignored. In 1758 he was appointed chief physician of the Royal Naval Hospital Haslar at Gosport. When James Cook went on his first voyage he carried wort (0.1 mg vitamin C per 100 g), sauerkraut (10–15 mg per 100 g) and a syrup, or \"rob\", of oranges and lemons (the juice contains 40–60 mg of vitamin C per 100 g) as antiscorbutics, but only the results of the trials on wort were published. In 1762 Lind's \"Essay on the most effectual means of preserving the health of seamen\" appeared. In it he recommended growing salad—i.e. watercress (662 mg vitamin C per 100 g)—on wet blankets. This was actually put in practice, and in the winter of 1775 the British Army in North America was supplied with mustard and cress seeds. However Lind, like most of the medical profession, believed that scurvy was essentially a result of ill-digested and putrefying food within the body, bad water, excessive work and living in a damp atmosphere which prevented healthful perspiration. Thus, while he recognised the benefits of citrus fruit (although he weakened the effect by switching to a boiled concentrated or \"rob\", the production of which unfortunately destroyed the vitamin C), he never advocated citrus juice as a single solution. He believed that scurvy had multiple causes which therefore required multiple remedies.\n\nThe medical establishment ashore continued to be wedded to the idea that scurvy was a disease of putrefaction, curable by the administration of elixir of vitriol, infusions of wort and other remedies designed to 'ginger up' the system. It could not account for the benefits of citrus fruits and dismissed the evidence in their favour as unproven and anecdotal. In the Navy however, experience had convinced many officers and surgeons that citrus juices provided the answer to scurvy even if the reason was unknown. On the insistence of senior officers, led by Rear Admiral Alan Gardner, in 1794 lemon juice was issued on board the \"Suffolk\" on a twenty-three-week, non-stop voyage to India. The daily ration of two-thirds of an ounce mixed in grog contained just about the minimum daily intake of 10 mg vitamin C. There was no serious outbreak of scurvy. This astonishing event resulted in a widespread demand within the Navy for lemon juice, backed by the Sick and Hurt Board whose numbers had recently been augmented by two practical naval surgeons who were well aware of Lind's experiment with citrus. The following year the Admiralty accepted its recommendation that lemon juice should be issued routinely to the whole fleet. Another Scot, Archibald Menzies, picked up citrus plants and dropped them off at Kealakekua Bay in Hawaii on the Vancouver Expedition, to help the Navy re-supply in the Pacific.\nThis was not the immediate end of scurvy in the Navy, as lemon juice was at first in such short supply that it could only be used in home waters as a cure under the direction of the surgeons rather than issued routinely as a preventative. Only after 1800 did the supply increase sufficiently so that, on the insistence of Admiral Lord St Vincent, it began to be issued generally.\n\nLind noticed that typhus disappeared from the top floor of his hospital, where patients were bathed and given clean clothes and bedding. However, incidence was very high on the lower floors where such hygiene measures were not in place. Lind recommended that sailors be stripped, shaved, scrubbed, and issued clean clothes and bedding regularly. As a result, British seamen did not suffer from typhus, giving the British navy a significant competitive advantage over the French.\n\nIn the 18th century sailors took along water, cordial and milk in casks. According to the \"Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majesty's Service at Sea\", which had been published for the first time in 1733 by the Admiralty, sailors were entitled to a gallon of weak beer daily (5/6 of the usual British gallon, equivalent to the modern American gallon or slightly more than three and a half litres). As the beer had been boiled in the brewing process it was reasonably free from bacteria and lasted for months unlike water kept in a cask for the same time. In the Mediterranean, wine was also issued, often fortified with brandy.\n\nA frigate with 240 men, equipped with stores for four months, carried more than one hundred tons of drinkable liquid. Water quality depended on the original source of the water, the condition of the casks and for how long it had been kept. During normal times sailors weren't allowed to take any water away. When water got scarce, it was rationed and rain water was collected with spread sails. Fresh water was also collected when an opportunity presented itself \"en voyage\", but watering places were often marshy, and in the tropics infested with malaria.\n\nIn 1759, Lind discovered that the steam of heated salt water was fresh. He also proposed to use solar energy for the distillation of water. But only when a new type of cooking stove was introduced in 1810 did the possibility arise of producing fresh water by distillation on a useful scale.\n\nLind's final work was published in 1768; the \"Essay on Diseases Incidental to Europeans in Hot Climates, with the Method of Preventing their fatal Consequences.\" It was a descriptive work on the symptoms and treatments of tropical disease, and was not specifically related to naval medicine and served more as a general text for doctors and British emigrants. The \"Essay\" was routinely used as a medical text in Britain in the fifty years following publication. Seven editions were printed, including two which were produced after Lind's death.\n\nLind was married to Isabella Dickie and they had two sons – John and James. In 1773 he was living on Princes Street in what was then a brand new house facing onto Edinburgh Castle.\n\nThe elder son, John Lind (1751–1794), studied medicine at St Andrews University and graduated in 1777, then succeeded James Lind as Chief Physician at Haslar Hospital in 1783. The younger son, James (1765–1823), also embarked on a career with the British navy. His cousin was James Lind (1736-1812).\n\nThe younger son James served at sea for a number of years, rising to the rank of post-captain, and was notable for his role in the Battle of Vizagapatam in 1804, for which he was knighted.\n\nHe died at Gosport in Hampshire, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1794. He is buried in St Mary's Parish Churchyard in Portchester.\n\nJames Lind's is one of twenty-three names to feature on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine building in Keppel Street, London. Names were selected by a committee of unknown constitution who chose those who were deemed to be pioneers in public health and tropical medicine.\n\nBULLET::::- James Lind Library (including biography and extracts from Lind's most important works)\nBULLET::::- The Lind pages with reference to the Lind family in general including a family tree and other family documents\nBULLET::::- James Lind Institute creates future bellwethers of clinical research industry and carries forward the legacy of James Lind\n"}
{"id": "16283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16283", "title": "James Clavell", "text": "James Clavell\n\nJames Clavell (born Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, 10 October 1921 – 6 September 1994), was an Australian (and later naturalized American) novelist, screenwriter, director, and World War II veteran and prisoner of war. Clavell is best known as the author of his Asian Saga novels, a number of which have had television adaptations. Clavell also authored such screenplays as those for \"The Fly\" (1958) (based on the short story by George Langelaan) and \"The Great Escape\" (1963) (based on the personal account of Paul Brickhill).\n\nBorn in Australia, Clavell was the son of Commander Richard Charles Clavell, a Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia with the Royal Australian Navy from 1920 to 1922. Clavell was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School, after which he returned to Australia.\n\nDuring 1940, aged 19, Clavell joined the Royal Artillery, and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese. Wounded by machine gun fire, he was eventually captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java. Later he was transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore.\n\nClavell suffered greatly at the hands of his Japanese captors. According to the introduction to Clavell's novel \"King Rat\" (1962), over 90 per cent of the prisoners who entered Changi never walked out. Clavell was reportedly saved, along with an entire battalion, by an American prisoner of war who later became the model for \"The King\" in \"King Rat\".\n\nBy 1946, Clavell had become a captain, but a motorcycle accident ended his military career. He enrolled with the University of Birmingham, where he met April Stride, an actress, whom he married in 1949 (date of marriage sometimes given as 1951). He would visit her on set while making films and began to be interested in becoming a film director.\n\nClavell entered the film industry via distribution and worked at that in England for a number of years. He tried to get into producing but had no luck so started writing screenplays. In 1954 he moved to New York, then to Hollywood. While trying to break into screenwriting he paid the bills working as a carpenter.\n\nIn 1956, he sold a script about pilots to RKO, \"Far Alert\". The same year Michael Pate bought a story of his \"Forbidden Territory\" for filming.\n\nNeither was filmed but \"Far Alert\" kept being sold and re-sold. \"In 18 months it brought in $87,000,\" he later said. \"We kept getting paid for writing it and rewriting it as it went from one studio to another. It was wonderful.\" It was later sold to Fox where it attracted the attention of Robert L. Lippert who hired Clavell to write the science-fiction horror movie \"The Fly\" (1958). This became a hit and launched Clavell as a screenwriter.\n\nHe wrote \"Watusi\" (1959) for director Kurt Neumann, who had also made \"The Fly\".\n\nClavell wrote \"Five Gates to Hell\" (1959) for Lippert, and when they could not find a suitable director, Clavell was given the job.\n\nParamount hired Clavell to write a film about the Bounty mutineers. It ended up not being made. Neither was a proposed movie about Francis Powers made. Clavell did write, produce, and direct a Western at Paramount, \"Walk Like a Dragon\" (1960).\n\nIn 1959, Clavell wrote \"Moon Landing\" and \"First Woman in the Moon\", two episodes of \"Men into Space\", a \"day after tomorrow\"-style science fiction drama, which depicted, in realistic terms, the (at the time) near future of space exploration.\n\nIn 1960 he had written a Broadway show with John Sturgis, \"White Alice\", a thriller set in the Arctic. It was never produced.\n\nIn 1960 the Writers Guild went on strike, meaning Clavell was unable to work. He decided to write a novel, \"King Rat\", based on his time at Changi. It took him three months and several more months after that to rework it. The book was published in 1962 and sold well. It was turned into a film in 1965.\n\nIn 1961, Clavell announced he had formed his own company, Cee Productions, who would make the films \"King Rat\", \"White Alice\" and \"No Hands on the Clock\".\n\nIn 1962 he signed a multi picture contract with a Canadian company to produce and direct two films there, \"Circle of Greed\" and \"The Sweet and the Bitter\". Only the second was made and it was not released until 1967.\n\nHe wrote scripts for the war films \"The Great Escape\" (1963) and \"633 Squadron\" (1964).\n\nHe wrote a short story, \"The Children's Story\" (1964) and the script for \"The Satan Bug\" (1965), directed by John Sturges who had made \"The Great Escape\". He also wrote \"Richard Sahib\" for Sturges which was never made.\n\nClavell wanted to write a second novel because \"that separates the men from the boys\". The money from \"King Rat\" enabled him to spend two years researching and then writing what became \"Tai-Pan\" (1966). It was a huge bestseller, and Clavell sold the film rights for a sizeable amount (although the movie would not be made until 1986).\n\nClavell returned to filmmaking. He wrote, produced and directed \"To Sir, With Love\" (1967), featuring Sidney Poitier and based on E. R. Braithwaite's semiautobiographical 1959 book. It was a huge critical and commercial success.\n\nClavell was now in much demand as a filmmaker. He produced and directed \"Where's Jack?\" (1969), a highwayman film which was a commercial failure. So too was an epic film about the Thirty Year War, \"The Last Valley\" (1971).\n\nClavell returned to novel writing, which was the focus of the remainder of his career. He spent three years researching and writing \"Shōgun\" (1975), about an Englishman who becomes a samurai in feudal Japan. It was another massive best seller. Clavell was heavily involved in the 1980 mini-series which starred Richard Chamberlain and achieved huge ratings.\n\nIn the late 1970s he spent three years researching and writing his fourth novel, \"Noble House\" (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963. It was another best seller and was turned into a miniseries in 1986.\n\nClavell briefly returned to filmmaking and directed a thirty-minute adaptation of his novelette \"The Children's Story\". He was meant to do a sequel to \"Shogun\" but instead found himself writing a novel about the 1979 revolution in Iran, \"Whirlwind\" (1986).\n\nClavell eventually returned to the \"Shogun\" sequel, writing \"Gai-Jin\" (1993). This was his last completed novel at the time of his death.\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Fly\" (1958) (writer)\nBULLET::::- \"Watusi\" (1959) (writer)\nBULLET::::- \"Five Gates to Hell\" (1959) (writer and director)\nBULLET::::- \"Walk Like a Dragon\" (1960) (writer and director)\nBULLET::::- \"The Great Escape\" (1963) (co-writer)\nBULLET::::- \"633 Squadron\" (1964) (co-writer)\nBULLET::::- \"The Satan Bug\" (1965) (co-writer)\nBULLET::::- \"King Rat\" (1965) (based on his novel)\nBULLET::::- \"To Sir, with Love\" (1967) (writer and director)\nBULLET::::- \"The Sweet and the Bitter\" (1967) (writer and director)\nBULLET::::- \"Where's Jack?\" (1968) (director)\nBULLET::::- \"The Last Valley\" (1970) (writer and director)\nBULLET::::- \"Shōgun\" TV miniseries (1980)\nBULLET::::- \"Tai-Pan\" (1986) (based on his novel)\nBULLET::::- \"Noble House\" TV miniseries (1988)\n\n\"The New York Times\" said that \"Clavell has a gift. It may be something that cannot be taught or earned. He breathes narrative ... He writes in the oldest and grandest tradition that fiction knows\". His first novel, \"King Rat\" (1962), was a semi-fictional account of his prison experiences at Changi. When the book was published it became an immediate best-seller, and three years later it was adapted as a movie. His next novel, \"Tai-Pan\" (1966), was a fictional account of Jardine Matheson's successful career in Hong Kong, as told via the character who was to become Clavell's heroic archetype, Dirk Struan. Struan's descendants were characters in almost all of his following books. \"Tai-Pan\" was adapted as a movie in 1986.\n\nClavell's third novel, \"Shōgun\" (1975), is set in 17th century Japan, and it tells the story of a shipwrecked English navigator in Japan, based on that of William Adams. When the story was made into a TV miniseries in 1980, produced by Clavell, it became the second highest rated miniseries in history with an audience of more than 120 million, after \"Roots\".\n\nClavell's fourth novel, \"Noble House\" (1981), became a bestseller that year and was adapted into a TV miniseries in 1988.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Noble House\", Clavell wrote \"Thrump-o-moto\" (1985), \"Whirlwind\" (1986), and \"Gai-Jin\" (1993).\n\nPeter Marlowe is Clavell's author surrogate, and a character of the novels \"King Rat\" and \"Noble House\" (1981); he is also mentioned once (as a friend of Andrew Gavallan's) in \"Whirlwind\" (1986). Featured most prominently in \"King Rat\", Marlowe is an English prisoner of war in Changi prison during World War II. In \"Noble House\", set two decades later, he is a novelist researching a book about Hong Kong. Marlowe's ancestors are also mentioned in other Clavell novels.\n\nIn \"Noble House\" Marlowe is mentioned as having written a novel about Changi which, although fictionalized, is based on real events (like those in \"King Rat\"). When asked which character was based on him, Marlowe answers, \"Perhaps I'm not there at all\", although in a later scene, he admits he was \"the hero, of course\".\n\nThe Asian Saga consists of seven novels:\n\nBULLET::::1. \"King Rat\" (1962), set in a Japanese POW camp in Singapore in 1945.\nBULLET::::2. \"Tai-Pan\" (1966), set in Hong Kong in 1841\nBULLET::::3. \"Shōgun\" (1975), set Japan from 1600 onwards\nBULLET::::4. \"Noble House\" (1981), set in Hong Kong in 1963\nBULLET::::5. \"Whirlwind\" (1986), set in Iran in 1979.\nBULLET::::6. \"Gai-Jin\" (1993), set in Japan in 1862\nBULLET::::7. \"Escape: The Love Story from Whirlwind\" (1994), a novella adapted from \"Whirlwind\" (1986)\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Children's Story\" (1964 \"Readers Digest\" short story; adapted as a movie and reprinted as a standalone book in 1981)\nBULLET::::- \"Thrump-O-Moto\" (1986), illustrated by George Sharp\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Art of War\" (1983), a translation of Sun Tzu's book.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Shōgun\" (1988 adaptation by Infocom, Inc., for Amiga, Apple II, DOS, Macintosh), interactive fiction with graphics and puzzle-solving; the user plays John Blackthorne, the first Englishman to set foot on Japanese soil\nBULLET::::- \"Shōgun\" (1986 adaptation by Virgin Games, Ltd., for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, DOS), interactive fiction with a third-person perspective; the user wanders around as one of a number of characters trying to improve his/her rapport with other people, battling and working to becoming a \"Shōgun\"\n\nIn 1963 Clavell became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Politically, he was said to have been an ardent individualist and proponent of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, as many of his books' heroes exemplify. Clavell admired Ayn Rand, founder of the Objectivist school of philosophy, and sent her a copy of \"Noble House\" during 1981 inscribed: \"This is for Ayn Rand—one of the real, true talents on this earth for which many, many thanks. James C, New York, 2 September 81.\"\n\nIn 1994, Clavell died in Switzerland from a stroke while suffering from cancer. He died one month before his 73rd birthday. After sponsorship by his widow, the library and archive of the Royal Artillery Museum at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in southeast London, was renamed the James Clavell Library in his honour. The library was later closed pending the opening of a new facility in Salisbury, Wiltshire; however, James Clavell Square on the Woolwich riverside remains.\n\nBULLET::::- New publication with private photos of the shooting & documents of 2nd unit cameraman Walter Riml\nBULLET::::- Photos of the filming The Great Escape\n"}

John's father David was Murtoa's general practitioner. Ellen, John's mother, and younger brothers David and Frank completed the family. When John was a small boy, his father left for World War I and served in Gallipoli and France. On return from the war, his father suffered from 'war-weariness' and had difficulty in continuing in general practice. Therefore, his father sold the practice and accepted a position with the Mental Hygiene Department. Over the next 25 years, Dr Cade Sr became medical superintendent at several Victorian mental hospitals, namely Sunbury, Beechworth and Mont Park. John and his brothers spent many of their younger years living within the grounds of these institutions, which had a great bearing on John's later deep understanding of the needs of the mentally ill. John was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, matriculating in 1928. He then studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating at the age of 21 years with honours in all subjects. He became a House Officer at St Vincent's Hospital and then Royal Children's Hospital before becoming severely ill with bilateral pneumococcal pneumonia. While he was convalescing, John fell in love with one of his nurses, Jean. They married in 1937.\n\nLike his father before him, Cade left his young family to fight for Australia in the Armed Forces in World War II. Cade was appointed captain, Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F., on 1 July 1940 and posted to the 2nd/9th Field Ambulance. Although trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Cade served as a surgeon and departed for Singapore in 1941 on RMS Queen Mary. He was promoted to major in September 1941. After the Fall of Singapore to Japan, he became a prisoner of war at Changi Prison from February 1942 to September 1945. During his imprisonment, he reportedly would observe some fellow inmates having strange, vacillating behaviour. He thought perhaps a toxin was affecting their brains and when it was eliminated through their urine, they lost their symptoms.\n\nAfter the war, Cade recuperated very briefly in Heidelberg Hospital, then took up a position at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments which led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. Since he had no sophisticated analytical equipment these experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of guinea pigs. His early experiments suggested to him that the urine from manic patients was more toxic. There are 2 toxic substances in urine: urea and uric acid. He found urea was the same in both ill and healthy people. He started to work on uric acid. In order to do that, he made artificial solutions of uric acid. To make up different strengths of uric acid he needed to convert it unto a substance that he could more easily manipulate. On its own uric acid would not dissolve in water. Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium was added to make a solution of lithium urate. Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with lithium carbonate solution, as a control solution, the guinea pigs were more restful. His use of careful controls in his experiments revealed that the lithium ion had a calming effect by itself, but even this finding may have been caused by the toxic effects of an excessive dose of lithium. After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans, Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with mania, dementia præcox or melancholia, with outstanding results. The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium.\n\nWhile Cade's results appeared highly promising, side-effects of lithium in some cases led to non-compliance. Toxicity of lithium led to several deaths of patients undergoing lithium treatment. The problem of toxicity was greatly reduced when suitable tests were developed to measure the lithium level in the blood. Moreover, as a naturally occurring chemical, lithium salt could not be patented, meaning that its manufacturing and sales were not considered commercially viable. These factors prevented its widespread adoption in psychiatry for some years, particularly in the United States, where its use was banned until 1970.\n\nIn 1952 Cade was appointed Superintendent and Dean of the clinical school at Royal Park Hospital. Two years later, at the request of the Mental Hygiene Authority which was planning to remodel Royal Park, he visited Britain for six months to inspect psychiatric institutions. On his return, he introduced modern facilities and replaced the rather authoritarian approach to patient care with a lot more personal and informal style that included group therapy. Concerned at the number of alcohol-related cases, he supported voluntary admission to aid early detection and later proposed the use of large doses of thiamine in the treatment of alcoholism. Cade served as the Superintendent at Royal Park until his retirement in 1977.\n\nHe served as the federal president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists in 1969–70, and also as the president for its Victoria branch from 1963 until his death in 1980. In the end, Dr. Cade's discovery did receive widespread acknowledgements and praise. For his contribution to psychiatry, he was awarded a Kittay International Award in 1974 (with Mogens Schou from Denmark), and he was invited to be a Distinguished Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists. In 1976, Cade was one of the first to be made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Dr. Cade remained humble about his chance discovery, describing himself as merely a gold prospector who happened to find a nugget. Finally, in July 2004, the Medical Journal of Australia reported that Cade's 1949 article, \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement\", was the number one most cited MJA article.\n\nJohn Cade died of oesophageal cancer at Fitzroy on 16 November 1980, and is buried at Yan Yean Cemetery in Whittlesea. Recognition of Cade's pioneering work continued after his death. The Adult Acute unit at Royal Park Hospital was named the \"John Cade Unit\" in recognition of Cade's long service to the hospital. After Royal Park's closure, the newly opened Adult Acute Psychiatric Unit at Royal Melbourne Hospital was named \"John Cade Adult Acute Inpatient Unit\". In 1980 the first John Cade memorial lecture was delivered by Mogens Schou at the congress in Jerusalem of the Collegian International Psychopharmacologium. In 2013 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) offered two $750 000 per annum fellowships for mental health research, entitled the \"NHMRC John Cade Fellowship in Mental Health Research\". The Fellowship recipients were Professor Helen Christensen of the University of New South Wales and Professor John McGrath of The University of Queensland. The RANZCP awards The John Cade Memorial Medal to a final year Victorian medical student following a special clinical examination at Monash University or the University of Melbourne each year. The Faculty of Medicine at University of Melbourne also awards the John Cade Memorial Prize.\n\nIn 2004, Film Australia and SBS screened the documentary \"Troubled Minds – The Lithium Revolution\", a 60-minute documentary portraying John Cade's discovery of the use of Lithium in mental illness. The documentary received international recognition, winning the main prize at the International Vega Awards for Excellence in Scientific Broadcasting.\n\"Troubled Minds\" was also recognised locally with writer/director Dennis K. Smith winning the AWGIE Award for Best Documentary.\n\nBULLET::::- Lithium pharmacology\n\nBULLET::::- Mitchell PB, Hadzi-Pavlovic D.

He had eight brothers and sisters. At an early age he left home to become a soldier of fortune in the Walloon cavalry in the Spanish Netherlands. In 1622, at the taking of Jülich, he won promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He served as a colonel of cavalry in the Bavarian army in 1630. He obtained the command of a regiment, both titular and effective, in 1632, and in 1633 and 1634 laid the foundations of his reputation as a swift and terrible leader of cavalry forays. His services were even more conspicuous in the great pitched Battle of Nördlingen (1634), after which the emperor made him a \"Freiherr\" of the Empire, and the elector of Bavaria gave him the rank of lieutenant field-marshal. About this time he armed his regiment with the musket as well as the sword.\n\nIn 1635 and 1636 Werth's forays extended into Lorraine and Luxembourg, after which he projected an expedition into the heart of France. Starting in July 1636, from the country of the lower Meuse, he raided far and wide, and even urged his commander in chief, the cardinal infante, to \"plant the double eagle on the Louvre\". Though this was not attempted. Werth's horsemen appeared at Saint-Denis before the a French army of fifty thousand men at Compiègne forced the invaders to retreat. The memory of this raid lasted long, and the name of \"Jean de Wert\" figures in folk-songs and serves as a bogey to quieten unruly children.\n\nIn 1637 Werth was once more in the Rhine valley, destroying convoys, relieving besieged towns and surprising the enemy's camps. In February 1638 he defeated the Weimar troops in an engagement at Rheinfelden, but shortly afterwards was made prisoner by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. His hopes of being exchanged for the Swedish field marshal Gustaf Horn were disappointed for Bernhard had to deliver up his captive to the French. The terrible Jean de Wert was brought to Paris, amidst great rejoicings from the country people. He was lionized by the society of the capital, visited in prison by high ladies. So light was his captivity that he said that nothing bound him but his word of honour. His release, which was delayed until March 1642 because the imperial government feared to see Horn at the head of the Swedish army and would not allow an exchange.\n\nWhen at last Werth reappeared in the field it was as general of cavalry in the imperial and Bavarian and Cologne services. His first campaign against the French marshal Guebriant was uneventful, but his second (1643) in which Baron Franz von Mercy was his commander-in-chief, ended with the battle of Tuttlingen in which Werth was instrumental in a surprise victory. In 1644 he was in the lower Rhine country, but he returned to Mercy's headquarters in time to fight in the battle of Freiburg. In the following year he played a decisive role in the second battle of Nördlingen. Mercy was killed in this action, and Werth temporarily commanded the defeated arm until succeeded by Field-marshal Geleen. Werth was disappointed, but remained thoroughly loyal to his soldierly code of honour, and found an outlet for his anger in renewed military activity.\n\nIn 1647 differences arose between the elector and the emperor as to the allegiance due from the Bavarian troops, in which, after long hesitation, Werth, fearing that the cause of the Empire and of the Catholic religion would be ruined if the elector resumed control of the troops, attempted to take his men over the Austrian border. But they refused to follow and, escaping with great difficulty from the elector's vengeance, Werth found a refuge in Austria. The emperor was grateful for his conduct in this affair, ordered the elector to rescind his ban, and made Werth a count. The last campaign of the war (1648) was uneventful, and shortly after its close he retired to live on the estates which he had bought in the course of his career, and on one of these, Benatek NE of Prague in Bohemia, a gift from the emperor, he died on 16 of January 1652. He was buried in the church of Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Benátky.\n\nJohann von Werth's life became a popular legend in the Rhineland and Cologne that is frequently reenacted at Karneval time:\n\nThe poor peasant Jan fell in love with Griet but she wanted a wealthier partner and declined his offer of marriage. Devastated by her rejection he came upon an army recruiter and signed up to go to war. Through hard work and good fortune he rose to become a general, celebrating several victories. After taking the fort at Hermannstein he was leading his triumphant troops into Cologne through , when he saw his former love Griet selling fruit at a market. Griet was filled with regret at turning down such a successful person and exclaimed \"Jan, who would have thought it?\" to which he replied \"Griet, the person who should have done it!\" and turns away.\n\nThe story has several variants. It has inspired many songs including one in 2001 by the rock band BAP. Jan von Werth's name has been used for centuries to name military and recreational organisations, particularly groups of mounted marksmen at Schützenfests and Karneval.\n\nBULLET::::- Attribution\nBULLET::::- Endnotes:\nBULLET::::- \"Lives\" F.

{"id": "16288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16288", "title": "Jürgen Habermas", "text": "Jürgen Habermas\n\nJürgen Habermas (, ; ; born 18 June 1929) is a German philosopher and sociologist in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism. His work addresses communicative rationality and the public sphere.\n\nAssociated with the Frankfurt School, Habermas's work focuses on the foundations of epistemology and social theory, the analysis of advanced capitalism and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, albeit within the confines of the natural law tradition, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas's theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the concept of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism, action theory, and poststructuralism.\n\nHabermas was born in Gummersbach, Rhine Province, in 1929. He was born with a cleft palate and had corrective surgery twice during childhood. Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication.\n\nAs a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by World War II. Until his graduation from gymnasium, Habermas lived in Gummersbach, near Cologne. His father, Ernst Habermas, was Executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer and, from 1933, a member of the NSDAP. Habermas himself was a \"Jungvolkführer\", a leader of the German Jungvolk, which was a section of the Hitler Youth. He was brought up in a staunchly Protestant milieu, his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of Göttingen (1949/50), Zurich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between the absolute and history in Schelling's thought, entitled, \"\" (\"The Absolute and History: On the Schism in Schelling's Thought\"). His dissertation committee included Erich Rothacker and Oskar Becker.\n\nFrom 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno at the Goethe University Frankfurt's Institute for Social Research, but because of a rift between the two over his dissertation—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the Frankfurt School had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture, he finished his habilitation in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His habilitation work was entitled \"\" (published in English translation in 1989 as \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society\"). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In 1961 he became a \"Privatdozent\" in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of \"extraordinary professor\" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg (at the instigation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Löwith) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher Albrecht Wellmer was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.\n\nHe accepted the position of Director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his magnum opus, \"The Theory of Communicative Action\". He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.\n\nHabermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of \"Permanent Visiting\" Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and \"Theodor Heuss Professor\" at The New School, New York.\n\nHabermas was awarded The Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on 5 March 2005, as part of the University of San Diego's Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled \"The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context\", regarding the evolution of separation of church and state from neutrality to intense secularism. He received the 2005 Holberg International Memorial Prize (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the humanities (including the social sciences) by \"The Times Higher Education Guide\", ahead of Max Weber and behind Erving Goffman.\n\nJürgen Habermas is the father of Rebekka Habermas, historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the University of Göttingen.\n\nHabermas is a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist Claus Offe (professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at La Trobe University and chief editor of the journal \"Thesis Eleven\"), the social philosopher Hans-Herbert Kögler (Chair of Philosophy at the University of North Florida), the sociological theorist Hans Joas (professor at the University of Erfurt and at the University of Chicago), the theorist of societal evolution Klaus Eder, the social philosopher Axel Honneth (the current director of the Institute for Social Research), the political theorist David Rasmussen (professor at Boston College and chief editor of the journal \"Philosophy & Social Criticism\"), the environmental ethicist Konrad Ott, the anarcho-capitalist philosopher Hans-Hermann Hoppe (who came to reject much of Habermas's thought), the American philosopher Thomas McCarthy, the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research Jeremy J. Shapiro, and the assassinated Serbian prime minister Zoran Đinđić.\n\nHabermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:\nBULLET::::- the German philosophical thought of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schelling, G. W. F. Hegel, Wilhelm Dilthey, Edmund Husserl and Hans-Georg Gadamer\nBULLET::::- the Marxian tradition—both the theory of Karl Marx himself as well as the critical neo-Marxian theory of the Frankfurt School, i.e. Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse.\nBULLET::::- the sociological theories of Max Weber, Émile Durkheim and George Herbert Mead\nBULLET::::- the linguistic philosophy and speech act theories of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, P. F. Strawson, Stephen Toulmin and John Searle\nBULLET::::- the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg\nBULLET::::- the American pragmatist tradition of Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey\nBULLET::::- the sociological social systems theory of Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann\nBULLET::::- Neo-Kantian thought\n\nJürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the rationalist tradition, by locating rationality in structures of interpersonal linguistic communication rather than in the structure of the cosmos. This social theory advances the goals of human emancipation, while maintaining an inclusive universalist moral framework. This framework rests on the argument called universal pragmatics—that all speech acts have an inherent telos (the Greek word for \"purpose\")—the goal of mutual understanding, and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the speech-act philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin and John Searle, the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of George Herbert Mead, the theories of moral development of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, and the discourse ethics of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student Karl-Otto Apel.\n\nHabermas's works resonate within the traditions of Kant and the Enlightenment and of democratic socialism through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an \"unfinished project,\" he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded. In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of postmodernist thought, for excessive pessimism, radicalism, and exaggerations.\n\nWithin sociology, Habermas's major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of societal evolution and modernization focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and strategic / instrumental rationality and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based theory of social systems developed by Niklas Luhmann, a student of Talcott Parsons.\n\nHis defence of modernity and civil society has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of late capitalism.\n\nHabermas perceives the rationalization, humanization and democratization of society in terms of the institutionalization of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the communicative competence that is unique to the human species. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the market, the state, and organizations, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the lifeworld.\n\nHabermas introduces the concept of \"reconstructive science\" with a double purpose: to place the \"general theory of society\" between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the \"great theorization\" and the \"empirical research\".\nThe model of \"rational reconstructions\" represents the main thread of the surveys about the \"structures\" of the world of life (\"culture\", \"society\" and \"personality\") and their respective \"functions\" (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between \"symbolic representation\" of \"the structures subordinated to all worlds of\nlife\" (\"internal relationships\") and the \"material reproduction\" of the social systems in their complex (\"external relationships\" between social systems and environment) has to be considered.\n\nThis model finds an application, above all, in the \"theory of the social evolution\", starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a phylogeny of the socio-cultural life forms (the \"hominization\") until an analysis of the development of \"social formations\", which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.\n\"This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of \"reconstruction of the logic of development\" of \"social formations\" summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the \"rationalization of the world of life\" and the \"growth in complexity of the social systems\"). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the \"explanation of the dynamics\" of \"historical processes\" and, in particular, about the \"theoretical meaning\" of the evolutional theory's propositions. Even if the German sociologist considers that the \"ex-post rational reconstructions\" and \"the models system/environment\" cannot have a complete \"historiographical application\", these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the \"historical explanation\"\".\n\nIn \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,\" Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a \"representational\" culture, where one party sought to \"represent\" itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects. As an example of \"representational\" culture, Habermas argued that Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace. Habermas identifies \"representational\" culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of \"Öffentlichkeit\" (the public sphere). In the culture characterized by \"Öffentlichkeit\", there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.\n\nIn Habermas's view, the growth in newspapers, journals, reading clubs, Masonic lodges, and coffeehouses in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of \"representational\" culture with \"Öffentlichkeit\" culture. Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the \"Öffentlichkeit\" culture was its \"critical\" nature. Unlike \"representational\" culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the \"Öffentlichkeit\" culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media. Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of \"Öffentlichkeit\" culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe. In his view, the French Revolution was in large part caused by the collapse of \"representational\" culture, and its replacement by \"Öffentlichkeit\" culture. Though Habermas's main concern in \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere\" was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.\n\nAccording to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a commercial mass media, which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the \"public sphere\" into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded rational consensus.\n\nHis most known work to date, the \"Theory of Communicative Action\" (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons AGIL Paradigm. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization. Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the welfare state, corporate capitalism and mass consumption. These reinforcing trends rationalize public life. Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and representative democracy replaces participatory one. In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the system and the lifeworld are deteriorating. Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens. An \"ideal speech situation\" requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors. In this version of the consensus theory of truth Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.\n\nHabermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere. He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant nation-state is replaced by a deliberative democracy-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens. In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance and as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the decision-making process.\n\nSeveral noted academics have provided various criticisms of Habermas's notions regarding the public sphere. John B. Thompson, a Professor of Sociology at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, has claimed that Habermas's notion of the public sphere is antiquated due to the proliferation of mass-media communications.\n\nMichael Schudson from the University of California, San Diego argues more generally that a public sphere as a place of purely rational independent debate never existed.\n\nNancy Fraser, the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy at The New School in New York City, is a noted feminist critic of Habermas's work on the public sphere, arguing for the existence of multiple spheres and counterpublics.\n\nHabermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, \"Modernity versus Postmodernity\" (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we \"should try to hold on to the \"intentions of the Enlightenment\", feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?\" Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, \"scientific\" understanding of the life-world.\n\nHabermas has several main criticisms of postmodernism:\n\nBULLET::::1. The postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;\nBULLET::::2. Habermas feels that the postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;\nBULLET::::3. Habermas accuses postmodernism of a totalizing perspective that fails \"to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society\";\nBULLET::::4. Habermas asserts that postmodernists ignore that which Habermas finds absolutely central – namely, everyday life and its practices.\n\nHabermas is famous as a public intellectual as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the popular press to attack the German historians Ernst Nolte, Michael Stürmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the \"Die Zeit\" on 11 July 1986 in a \"feuilleton\" (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled \"A Kind of Settlement of Damages\". Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for \"apologistic\" history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to \"close Germany's opening to the West\" that in Habermas's view had existed since 1945.\n\nHabermas argued that Nolte, Stürmer, Hildebrand and Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the Holocaust from the mainstream of German history, explain away Nazism as a reaction to Bolshevism, and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the Wehrmacht (German Army) during World War II. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a \"vicarious religion\" in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a \"kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism\". About Hillgruber's statement that Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews \"because only such a 'racial revolution' could lend permanence to the world-power status of his \"Reich\"\", Habermas wrote: \"Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too\".\n\nHabermas wrote: \"The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about \"the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe\" (Stürmer) and \"the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center\" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism.\"\n\nThe so-called \"Historikerstreit\" (\"Historians' Quarrel\") was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like Joachim Fest, Hagen Schulze, Horst Möller, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand. In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as Martin Broszat, Eberhard Jäckel, Hans Mommsen, and Hans-Ulrich Wehler.\n\nHabermas and Jacques Derrida engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida's death in 2004. They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published \"Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida\" in \"The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity\" in which he described Derrida's method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique. Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, \"those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me\". After Derrida's final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy \"conducted a kind of 'war', in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly\".\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt. In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled \"How to answer the ethical question?\" at the \"Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida\" conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the War on Terror in Giovanna Borradori's \"Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida\". In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming Iraq War; in a manifesto that later became the book \"Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe\", the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the European Union in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas's declaration of February 2003 (\"February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe\") in the book, which was a reaction to the Bush administration's demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War. Habermas has offered further context for this declaration in an interview.\n\nHabermas's attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas's attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an \"alienating reality\" and \"control tool\"; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st Century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas has recognized the positive social role of religion.\n\nIn an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:\n\nThe original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is:\n\nThis statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying:\n\nIn his book \"Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion\" (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: secular people need to tolerate the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa.\n\nIn early 2007, Ignatius Press published a dialogue between Habermas and the then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Holy Office Joseph Ratzinger (elected as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005), entitled \"The Dialectics of Secularization\". The dialogue took place on January 14, 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the Catholic Academy of Bavaria in Munich. It addressed contemporary questions such as:\nBULLET::::- Is a public culture of reason and ordered liberty possible in our post-metaphysical age?\nBULLET::::- Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in being and anthropology?\nBULLET::::- Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for religion itself?\n\nIn this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a \"methodological atheist,\" which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified liberal thinkers, \"to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly illiberal.\"\n\nThough, in the first period of his career, he began as a skeptic of any social usefulness of religion, he now believes there is a social role and utilitarian moral strength in religion, and notably, that there is a necessity of Judeochristian ethics in culture.\n\nIn addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of \"post-secular\" society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.\n\nHabermas has sided with other 20th-century commentators on Marx such as Hannah Arendt who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx's apparent over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his \"Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason\".

{"id": "16289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16289", "title": "James Watson", "text": "James Watson\n\nJames Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist. In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nWatson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maaløe, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. From 1968 he served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between intelligence and race. Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project.\n\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook \"Molecular Biology of the Gene\" (1965) and his bestselling book \"The Double Helix\" (1968).\n\nIn January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary in which Watson repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to him and severed all ties with him.\nJames D. Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a businessman descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of parents from County Tipperary, Ireland. Raised Catholic, he later described himself as \"an escapee from the Catholic religion.\" Watson said, \"The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didn't believe in God.\"\n\nWatson grew up on the south side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Grammar School and South Shore High School. He was fascinated with bird watching, a hobby shared with his father, so he considered majoring in ornithology. Watson appeared on \"Quiz Kids,\" a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions. Thanks to the liberal policy of University president Robert Hutchins, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a tuition scholarship, at the age of 15.\n\nAfter reading Erwin Schrödinger's book \"What Is Life?\" in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics. Watson earned his BS degree in Zoology from the University of Chicago in 1947. In his autobiography, \"Avoid Boring People\", Watson described the University of Chicago as an \"idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth\", in contrast to his description of later experiences. In 1947 Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schrödinger presented in his 1944 book. He received his PhD degree from Indiana University in 1950; Salvador Luria was his doctoral advisor.\n\nOriginally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of Salvador Luria. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the Luria–Delbrück experiment, which concerned the nature of genetic mutations. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages. He and Max Delbrück were among the leaders of this new \"Phage Group,\" an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as \"Drosophila\" towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria's laboratory at Indiana University. That spring, he met Delbrück first in Luria's apartment and again that summer during Watson's first trip to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL).\n\nThe Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene. In 1949, Watson took a course with Felix Haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves. The other major molecular component of chromosomes, DNA, was widely considered to be a \"stupid tetranucleotide,\" serving only a structural role to support the proteins. Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment, which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson's research project involved using X-rays to inactivate bacterial viruses.\n\nWatson then went to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar. Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's. After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maaløe, then a member of the Phage Group.\n\nThe experiments, which Watson had learned of during the previous summer's Cold Spring Harbor phage conference, included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection. The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbrück, they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA. Watson never developed a constructive interaction with Kalckar, but he did accompany Kalckar to a meeting in Italy, where Watson saw Maurice Wilkins talk about his X-ray diffraction data for DNA. Watson was now certain that DNA had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated.\n\nIn 1951, the chemist Linus Pauling in California published his model of the amino acid alpha helix, a result that grew out of Pauling's efforts in X-ray crystallography and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the California Institute of Technology, Watson now had the desire to learn to perform X-ray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA. That summer, Luria met John Kendrew, and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for Watson in England. In 1951 Watson visited the Stazione Zoologica 'Anton Dohrn' in Naples.\n\nIn mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA. Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at King's College London — mainly by Rosalind Franklin, under the supervision of Maurice Wilkins. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled to the scientific journal \"Nature\", which was published on April 25, 1953. Bragg gave a talk at the Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by Ritchie Calder in the London newspaper \"News Chronicle\", entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.\"\n\nSydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University's Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.\n\nThe Cambridge University student newspaper \"Varsity\" also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in \"Nature\". Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix.\n\nWatson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids. Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for nomination.\n\nThe publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science: understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.\n\nWatson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling was unauthorized. They used some of her unpublished data—without her consent—in their construction of the double helix model of DNA. Franklin's results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel.\n\nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: \nBULLET::::1. Her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,\nBULLET::::2. Discussions with Wilkins, who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin,\nBULLET::::3. A research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories. Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories.\n\nAccording to one critic, Watson's portrayal of Franklin in \"The Double Helix\" was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data. The accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside.\n\nA review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters began on friendly terms with \"Dear Jim\", and concluded with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as \"Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind\". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of \"Nature\". These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C. \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\" \"Nature\" 171, 737–738 (1953); Wilkins M.H.F., Stokes A.R. & Wilson, H.R. \"Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids\" Nature 171, 738–740 (1953); Franklin R. and Gosling R.G. \"Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate\" \"Nature\" 171, 740–741 (1953).\n\nIn 1956, Watson accepted a position in the Biology department at Harvard University. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.\n\nHe championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology, stating that disciplines such as ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings, going so far as to discourage their study by students.\n\nWatson continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968.\n\nViews on Watson's scientific contributions while at Harvard are somewhat mixed. His most notable achievements in his two decades at Harvard may be what he wrote about science, rather than anything he discovered during that time. Watson's first textbook, \"The Molecular Biology of the Gene\", set a new standard for textbooks, particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings. His next textbook was \"Molecular Biology of the Cell\", in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third textbook was \"Recombinant DNA\", which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function. The textbooks are still in print.\n\nIn 1968, Watson wrote \"The Double Helix\", listed by the Board of the Modern Library as number seven in their list of \"100 Best Nonfiction\" books. The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson's original title was to have been \"Honest Jim\". Some controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson's book was originally to be published by the Harvard University Press, but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins objected, among others. Watson's home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published.\n\nDuring his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the Vietnam War, leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for \"the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam.\" In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President Gerald Ford, arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.\n\nIn 1968, Watson became the Director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Between 1970 and 1972, the Watsons' two sons were born, and by 1974, the young family made Cold Spring Harbor their permanent residence. Watson served as the laboratory's director and president for about 35 years, and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then Chancellor Emeritus.\n\nIn his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, \"dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering.\" CSHL substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson's direction. He is credited with \"transforming a small facility into one of the world's great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer.\" In a retrospective summary of Watson's accomplishments there, Bruce Stillman, the laboratory's president, said, \"Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science.\"\n\nIn 2007, Watson said, \"I turned against the left wing because they don't like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.\"\n\nIn 1990, Watson was appointed as the Head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992. Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, Bernadine Healy. Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the \"laws of nature.\" Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, \"The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations.\" He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs. (The issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the US by the US Supreme Court; see Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office)\n\nIn 1994, Watson became President of CSHL. Francis Collins took over the role as Director of the Human Genome Project.\n\nHe was quoted in \"The Sunday Telegraph\" in 1997 as stating: \"If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn't want a homosexual child, well, let her.\" The biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a letter to \"The Independent\" claiming that Watson's position was misrepresented by \"The Sunday Telegraph\" article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasise that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.\n\nOn the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: \"Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them.\"\n\nWatson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the \"really stupid\" bottom 10% of people should be cured. He has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered, saying in 2003, \"People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.\"\n\nIn 2007, James Watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online, after it was presented to him on May 31, 2007, by 454 Life Sciences Corporation in collaboration with scientists at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Watson was quoted as saying, \"I am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine, in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies\".\n\nIn 2014 Watson published a paper in \"The Lancet\" suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that \"The Lancet\" published Watson's paper only because of his name. Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.\n\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel prize medal to raise money; part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research. The medal sold at auction at Christie's in December 2014 for . Watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in Long Island and to funding research at Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first living Nobel recipient to auction a medal. The medal was later returned to Watson by the purchaser, Alisher Usmanov.\n\nSeveral of Watson's former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, Mario Capecchi, Bob Horvitz, Peter B. Moore and Joan Steitz. Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including Ewan Birney, Ronald W. Davis, Phillip Allen Sharp (postdoc), John Tooze, (postdoc) and Richard J. Roberts (postdoc).\n\nWatson is a former member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by Chang Yi Wang. He held the position for six years and retired from the board in 1999.\n\nIn January 2007, Watson accepted the invitation of Leonor Beleza, president of the Champalimaud Foundation, to become the head of the foundation's scientific council, an advisory organ.\n\nIn March 2017, Watson was named head consultant of the Cheerland Investment Group, a Chinese investment company which sponsored his trip.\n\nWatson has also been an institute adviser for the Allen Institute for Brain Science.\n\nWatson has had disagreements with Craig Venter regarding his use of EST fragments while Venter worked at NIH. Venter went on to found Celera genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter \"Hitler\".\n\nIn his memoir, \"Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science\", Watson describes his academic colleagues as \"dinosaurs,\" \"deadbeats,\" \"fossils,\" \"has-beens,\" \"mediocre,\" and \"vapid.\" Steve Shapin in \"Harvard Magazine\" noted that Watson had written an unlikely \"Book of Manners,\" telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist's career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E. O. Wilson once described Watson as \"the most unpleasant human being I had ever met\", but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard old history (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).\n\nIn the epilogue to the memoir \"Avoid Boring People\", Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president Lawrence Summers, who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science. Watson also states in the epilogue, \"Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated.\"\n\nAt a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos. His lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. \"That's why you have Latin lovers,\" he said, according to people who attended the lecture. \"You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient.\" He has also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity, and Indians being servile. \n\nWatson has repeatedly asserted that differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetics. In early October 2007, he was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). He discussed his view that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners. Watson said his intention was to promote science, not racism, but some UK venues canceled his appearances, and he canceled the rest of his tour. An editorial in \"Nature\" said that his remarks were \"beyond the pale,\" but wished that the tour had not been canceled so that Watson would have had to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter. Because of the controversy, the Board of Trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson's administrative responsibilities. Watson issued an apology, then retired at the age of 79 from CSHL from what the lab called \"nearly 40 years of distinguished service\". Watson attributed his retirement to his age, and circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired.\n\nIn 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. In a BBC documentary that year, Watson said he did not see himself as a racist. , he continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. \n\nIn January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary made the previous year in which he repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to Watson, and cut all remaining ties with him. Watson did not respond to the developments, having been ill since a car accident in October 2018.\n\nWatson is an atheist. In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nWatson married Elizabeth Lewis in 1968. They have two sons, Rufus Robert Watson (born 1970) and Duncan James Watson (1972). Watson sometimes talks about his son Rufus, who suffers from schizophrenia, seeking to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contributes to it.\n\nWatson has won numerous awards including:\nBULLET::::- Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, 1960\nBULLET::::- Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences (2001)\nBULLET::::- Copley Medal of the Royal Society, 1993\nBULLET::::- CSHL Double Helix Medal Honoree, 2008\nBULLET::::- Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry, 1960\nBULLET::::- EMBO Membership in 1985\nBULLET::::- Gairdner Foundation International Award, 2002\nBULLET::::- Honorary Member of Royal Irish Academy, 2005\nBULLET::::- Honorary Fellow, the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution\nBULLET::::- Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), 2002\nBULLET::::- Irish America Hall of Fame, inducted March 2011\nBULLET::::- John J.

{"id": "16290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16290", "title": "Jerk (physics)", "text": "Jerk (physics)\n\nIn physics, jerk or jolt is the rate of change of acceleration; that is, the time derivative of acceleration, or the second derivative of velocity, or the third derivative of position. The SI unit for jerk is m/s. Jerk can also be expressed in standard gravity per second (\"g\"/s). Jerk is a vector (directional) quantity.\n\nJerk can be formulated in any of the following equivalent ways:\n\nwhere\n\nThere is no standard symbol for jerk, but formula_6 is commonly used. \n\nThe fourth derivative of position, equivalent to the first derivative of jerk, is jounce (also known as \"snap\").\n\nThe definition of jerk is based on a third derivative. For this reason, in mathematics differential equations of the form\nare sometimes called \"jerk equations\". It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first-order ordinary non-linear differential equations, is in a mathematically well-defined sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in \"jerk systems\". Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are accordingly called \"hyperjerk systems\".\n\nHuman body position is controlled by balancing the forces of antagonistic muscles. In balancing a given force, such as holding up a weight, the postcentral gyrus establishes a control loop to achieve the desired equilibrium. If the force changes too quickly, the muscles cannot relax or build up tension fast enough and overshoot in either direction, causing a temporary loss of control. The reaction time for responding to changes in force is limited by physiological bounds and also depends on the attention level of the brain: an \"expected\" change will be stabilized faster than a \"sudden\" drop or increase of load.\n\nTo avoid vehicle passengers losing control over their body motion, and possibly being injured, it is not only necessary to limit the maximum force (acceleration) to which they are exposed, but also the maximum jerk, since they need time to adapt to even limited stress changes by adjusting their muscle tension. Sudden changes in acceleration can cause conditions such as whiplash. Even where occupant safety is not an issue, excessive jerk may result in an uncomfortable ride. Engineers expend considerable design effort to minimize \"jerky motion\" on elevators, trams, and other conveyances. Jerk can also cause unwanted vibrations in vehicles.\n\nAs an everyday example, driving in a car can show effects of acceleration and jerk. More skilled and experienced drivers can accelerate smoothly, but beginners often provide a \"jerky\" ride.\nBULLET::::- This is seen when changing gears in a car with a foot-operated clutch: although the accelerating force is limited by engine power, an inexperienced driver can provide \"severe\" jerk because of intermittent force closure over the clutch.\nBULLET::::- High-powered sports cars offer the feeling of being pressed into the cushioning, but this is the force of the acceleration. Jerk occurs only in the very first moments, when the torque of the engine starts at zero and grows with the rotational speed, causing a remarkable growth (jerk) of the acceleration.\nBULLET::::- When braking suddenly, passengers initially whip forward (with respect to the car) to a bigger extent than the achieved acceleration alone accomplishes during the rest of the braking process, since muscle tension regains control of the body quickly after the onset of braking. This also happens during collisions. These effects are not modeled in vehicle testing using cadavers or crash test dummies, since they are affected by the body's active muscle control.\n\nFor some remarks on how the human perception of various motions is organized in the proprioceptors, the vestibular organ and by visual impressions, and how to deceive it, see the article on motion simulators.\n\nAcceleration formula_8 is related to force formula_9 according to Newton's second law:\nwith proportionality given by the mass formula_11.\n\nIn classical mechanics of rigid bodies there are \"no forces\" associated with the derivatives of acceleration, however real physical systems experience oscillations and deformation as a result of jerk. It has been reported that NASA in designing the Hubble Telescope not only set limits on jerk, but also on the next higher derivative, the jounce.\n\nFor a recoil force on accelerating \"charged\" particles emitting radiation, which is proportional to their jerk and the square of their charge, see the Abraham–Lorentz force. A more advanced theory, applicable in a relativistic and quantum environment, accounting for self-energy is provided in Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory.\n\nIn real world environments, because of deformation, effects of quantum mechanics, and other reasons, discontinuities in acceleration do not occur. However, frequently used idealized settings (rigid bodies, smooth representations of paths, no friction, and the like) applied to an also idealized point mass moving along a piecewise smooth and as a whole continuous path, suffice for the phenomenon of a jump-discontinuity in acceleration at the points where the path is not smooth, and accordingly for an unbounded jerk in this simplified model of classical mechanics (see two examples below). Extrapolating from the idealized settings, the effect of jerk in real situations can be qualitatively described, explained and predicted.\n\nThe jump-discontinuity in acceleration may be modeled by a Dirac delta in the jerk, scaled with the height of this jump. Integrating jerk over time generally gives the according acceleration; doing so across such a Dirac delta reconstructs exactly the jump discontinuity in the acceleration belonging to the Dirac delta in the jerk.\n\nAssume a path along a circular arc with radius formula_12, which tangentially connects to a straight line. The whole path is continuous and its pieces are smooth. Now let a point particle move with constant speed along this path, so its tangential acceleration is zero, and consider the acceleration orthogonal to the path: it is zero along the straight part and formula_13 along the circle (centripetal acceleration). This gives a jump-discontinuity in the magnitude of the acceleration by formula_13, and the particle undergoes a jerk measured by a Dirac delta scaled with this value, for purely geometric reasons, when it passes the connection of the pieces. See below for a more concrete application.\n\nIf we assume an idealized spring and idealized, kinetic frictional forces, proportional to the normal force and directed oppositely to the velocity, there is another example of discontinuous acceleration. Let a mass, connected to an ideal spring, oscillate on a flat, idealized surface with friction. Each time the velocity changes sign (at the maxima of displacement), the magnitude of the force on the mass, which is the vectorial sum of the spring force and the kinetic frictional force, changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, since the spring force is continuous and the frictional force \"reverses\" its direction when the velocity does. Therefore the acceleration jumps by this amount divided by the mass. That is, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration and the jerk contains a Dirac delta, each time the mass passes through the (decreasing) maximal displacements, until it comes to a halt, because the static friction force adapts to the residual spring force, establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.\n\nThe car example relies on the way the brakes operate on a rotating drum or on a disc. As long as the disc rotates the brake pads act to decelerate the vehicle via the kinetic frictional forces which create a constant braking torque on the disk. This decreases the rotation \"linearly\" to zero with \"constant\" angular acceleration, but when the rotation reaches exactly zero, this hitherto constant frictional force \"suddenly\" drops to zero, as well as the torque, and the associated acceleration of the car. This, of course, neglects all effects of tire sliding, dipping of suspension, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc. A sudden drop in acceleration indicates a Dirac delta in the \"physical\" jerk, which is smoothed down by the \"real\" environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping, to the \"physiologically\" perceived \"jerk\".\n\nAnother example of significant jerk, analogous to the first setting, is given by cutting the rope twirling a particle around a center. When the rope is cut, the circular path with non-zero centripetal acceleration changes abruptly to a straight path with suddenly no force in the direction to the former center. Imagine a monomolecular fiber, cut by a laser and it arrives at very high rates of jerk, because of the extremely short cutting time.\n\nConsider a rotational movement of a rigid body about a fixed axis in an inertial frame. The orientation of the solid can be expressed by an angle formula_15, the angular position, from which one can express:\n\nDifferentiating the formula_20 with respect to time, defines an angular jerk formula_21:\n\nThe angular acceleration corresponds to the quotient of the torque acting on the body and the moment of inertia of the body with respect to the momentary axis of rotation. An abrupt change of the torque results in an important angular jerk.\n\nThe general case of a rigid body movement in space can be modeled by a kinematic screw, which specifies at each instant one (axial) vector, the angular velocity formula_23 and one (polar) vector, the linear velocity formula_24. From this the angular acceleration is defined as\nand thus the angular jerk\n\nConsider for example a Geneva drive, a device for creating an intermittent rotation of the driven wheel (blue) from a continuous rotation of the driving wheel (red). On one cycle of the driving wheel there is a variation of the angular position formula_15 of the driven wheel by one quarter of a cycle, and a constant angular position on the remainder of the cycle.\n\nBecause of the necessary finite thickness of the fork making up the slot for the driving pin this device generates a discontinuity in the angular acceleration formula_28, and therefore an unbounded angular jerk formula_29 in the driven wheel.\n\nThis does not preclude the mechanism from being used in e.g. movie projectors to stepwise transport the film with high reliability (very long life) and just slight noise, since the load is very low - the system drives just that part of the film which is within the corridor of projection, so a very low mass (a few centimeters thin plastic film), with low friction, at a moderate speed (2.4 m/s, 8.6 km/h) is affected.\n\nTo avoid the jerk inherent in a single cam device, a dual cam device can be used instead, bulkier and more expensive, but also quieter. This operates two cams on one axis in continuous rotation and shifting another axle about a fraction of a full revolution. The pictures show a step drive by one-sixth and one-third rotation, respectively per full revolution of the driving axle. Note that two of the arms of the stepped wheel are always in contact with the double cam, so there is no radial clearance.\n\nGenerally, combined contacts may be used to avoid jerk (and also wear and noise) associated with one single follower, e.g. gliding along a slot and thereby changing its contact point from one side of the slot to the other, by using two followers always sliding along the same, one side each.\n\nA force/acceleration acting on an elastically deformable mass will affect a deformation which depends on its stiffness and the acceleration applied. If the change of this force is slow, the jerk is small, and the propagation of this deformation through the body may be considered instantaneously compared to the change in acceleration. The distorted body acts as if it were in a quasi-static regime. It is the common thread that only a changing force, i.e. a non-zero jerk, can cause mechanical (or on a charged particle: electromagnetic) waves to be radiated. So for non-zero to high jerk a shock wave and its propagation through the body is to be considered. The left picture shows the propagation of a deformation as a compressional, plane wave through an elastically deformable material. For angular jerk the deformation waves are arranged circularly and cause shear stress as shown in the adjacent picture, which also might cause other modes of vibration. As usual with waves, one has to consider their reflections along all boundaries and the emerging interference patterns, i.e. destructive as well as constructive interference, which may lead to exceeding boundaries of structural integrity. As a rough estimate the deformation waves result in vibrations of the whole device and, generally, vibrations cause noise, wear, and, especially in resonance cases, even disruption.\n\nThe picture to the left shows a massive top bending the elastic pole, to which it is connected, to the left, when the bottom block is accelerated to the right. When the block stops accelerating, the top on the pole will start a (damped) oscillation under the regime of the stiffness of the pole. This could make plausible, how a bigger (periodic) jerk might excite a bigger amplitude of the oscillations, because any small oscillations are damped before they get reinforced by another amplitude of the shock wave.\n\nOne can also argue that a \"steeper\" slope of the acceleration, i.e. a bigger jerk, excites bigger wave components in the shockwave with higher frequencies, belonging to higher Fourier coefficients, and so an increased probability of exciting a resonant mode.\n\nAs a general rule, to reduce the amplitude of excited stress waves, causing vibrations, any motion of massive parts has to be shaped by limiting the jerk, i.e. making the acceleration continuous and keep its slopes as flat as possible. Since the described effects are almost not amenable to abstract models anymore, the various suggested algorithms for reducing vibrations include still higher derivatives such as the jounce or suggest continuous regimes not only for the acceleration, but also for the jerk. One concept is e.g. shaping the acceleration and deceleration sinusoidal with zero-acceleration in between (see the profile to the right), making the speed look sinusoidal with constant maximal speed, too. The jerk however will remain discontinuous at the points when the acceleration enters and leaves its zero-phases.\nThe principles of geometric design apply to the jerk oriented orthogonally to the path of motion, considering the centripetal acceleration, whereas the velocity along the path is assumed to be constant, and so the tangential jerk is zero. Any change in curvature of the path implies non-zero jerk, arising from purely geometric reasons. To avoid the unbounded (centripetal) jerk when moving from a straight path into a curve or vice versa, track transition curves are constructed, which limit the jerk by gradually increasing the centripetal acceleration, i.e. the curvature, to the value that belongs to the radius of the circle and the speed of travel. The theoretical optimum is achieved by the Euler spiral, which linearly increases the acceleration, i.e., constant jerk. As a design rule a maximum value of 0.5 m/s and for convenience purposes a value of 0.35 m/s are recommended in railway design. The picture shows a piece of an Euler spiral leading as track transition curve from a straight line to an arc of a circle. In the real scenario the plane of the track is inclined in the course of the curve and so also this vertical acceleration of the necessary lifting of the center of mass of the rail car has to be considered to minimize the wear on the embankment and the tracks by following a slightly different curve. This has been patented as the \"Wiener Kurve\" (Viennese Curve).\n\nRoller coasters are of course also subject to these design considerations, when rolling into a loop. The acceleration values range up to 4g in this environment and it would not be possible to ride loopings without track transitions, as well as one cannot smoothly drive along a figure eight consisting of circles. Any S-shaped curve must contain some jerk-reducing transition.\n\nIn motion control the focus is on straight linear motion, where the need is to move a system from one steady position to another (point-to-point motion). So effectively, the jerk resulting from tangential acceleration is under control. Prominent applications are elevators in people transportation, and the support of tools in machining. It is reported that most passengers rate a vertical jerk of 2.0 m/s in a lift ride as acceptable, 6.0 m/s as intolerable and for a hospital environment 0.7 m/s is suggested. In any case, limiting jerk is considered essential for riding convenience. ISO 18 738 defines how to measure elevator ride quality with respect to jerk, acceleration, vibrations and noise, but does not venture into defining what are different levels of elevator ride quality.\n\nAchieving the shortest possible transition time, thereby not exceeding given limit magnitudes for speed, acceleration, and jerk, will result in a third-order motion profile, with quadratic ramping and de-ramping phases in the velocity, as illustrated below:\n\nThis motion profile consists of up to seven segments defined by the following:\nBULLET::::1. acceleration build-up: \"limit jerk\" implies \"linear increase\" of acceleration to the \"limit acceleration\", \"quadratic increase\" of speed\nBULLET::::2. limit acceleration: implies \"zero jerk\" and \"linear increase\" of speed\nBULLET::::3. acceleration ramp-down: approaching the desired limit velocity with \"negative limit jerk\", i.e. \"linear decrease\" of acceleration, \"(negative) quadratic increase\" of speed\nBULLET::::4. limit speed: implies \"zero jerk\" and \"zero acceleration\"\nBULLET::::5. deceleration build-up: \"limit negative jerk\" implies \"linear decrease\" of acceleration to the \"negative limit acceleration\", \"(negative) quadratic decrease\" of speed\nBULLET::::6. limit deceleration: implies \"zero jerk\" and \"linear decrease\" of speed\nBULLET::::7. deceleration ramp-down: \"limit jerk\" implies \"linear increase\" of acceleration to zero, \"quadratic decrease\" of speed, approaching the desired position at zero speed and zero acceleration\n\nThe time allotted to segment 4, concerning constant velocity, is to be varied to suit the distance between the two positions. If the initial and final positions are so close together that a complete omission of this 4th segment does not suffice, the segments 2 and 6 with constant acceleration are equally reduced and the limit of speed would not be reached in this variant of the profile. If also this does not reduce the crossed distance sufficiently, in a next step the ramping segments 1, 3, 5, and 7 are to be shortened by an equal amount and the limit of acceleration is also not reached.\n\nThere are also other strategies to design a motion profile, e.g. minimizing the square of the jerk for a given transition time, to be selected according to the varying applications in machines, people movers, chain hoists, automotive industries, robot design, and many more. For a sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profile, with sinusoidal-shaped speed and bounded jerk also, see above.\n\nJerk is also important to consider in manufacturing processes. Rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in uneven cuts. This is why modern motion controllers include jerk limitation features.\nIn mechanical engineering, jerk is considered, in addition to velocity and acceleration, in the development of cam profiles because of tribological implications and the ability of the actuated body to follow the cam profile without chatter.\nJerk must often be considered when the excitation of vibrations is a concern. A device that measures jerk is called a \"jerkmeter\".\n\nBULLET::::- Abraham–Lorentz force, a force in electrodynamics whose magnitude is proportional to jerk\nBULLET::::- Geomagnetic jerk\nBULLET::::- Jounce, the derivative of jerk\nBULLET::::- Shock (mechanics)\nBULLET::::- Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory\n\n\nBULLET::::- What is the term used for the third derivative of position?, description of jerk in the Usenet Physics FAQ\nBULLET::::- Mathematics of Motion Control Profiles\nBULLET::::- Elevator-Ride-Quality\nBULLET::::- Elevator manufacturer brochure\nBULLET::::- Patent of \"Wiener Kurve\"\nBULLET::::- Description of \"Wiener Kurve\"\n"}

He was the eldest of seven children of James Fleming DD (died 1879), a Congregational minister, and his wife Mary Ann, at Lancaster, Lancashire, and baptised on 11 February 1850. A devout Christian, he once preached at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London on evidence for the resurrection. In 1932, he and Douglas Dewar and Bernard Acworth helped establish the Evolution Protest Movement. Fleming bequeathed much of his estate to Christian charities, especially those for the poor. He was a noted photographer, painted water colours, and enjoyed climbing the Alps.\n\nAmbrose Fleming was born in Lancaster and educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, University College School, London, and then University College London. He entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1877, gaining his BA in 1881 and becoming a Fellow of St John's in 1883. He went on to lecture at several universities including the University of Cambridge, University College Nottingham, and University College London, where he was the first professor of electrical engineering. He was also consultant to the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Swan Company, Ferranti, Edison Telephone, and later the Edison Electric Light Company. In 1892, Fleming presented an important paper on electrical transformer theory to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London.\n\nFleming started school at about the age of ten, attending a private school where he particularly enjoyed geometry. Prior to that his mother tutored him and he had learned, virtually by heart, a book called the \"Child's Guide to Knowledge\", a popular book of the day – even as an adult he would quote from it. His schooling continued at the University College School where, although accomplished at maths, he habitually came bottom of the class at Latin.\n\nEven as a boy he wanted to become an engineer. At 11 he had his own workshop where he built model boats and engines. He even built his own camera, the start of a lifelong interest in photography. Training to become an engineer was beyond the family's financial resources, but he reached his goal via a path that alternated education with paid employment.\n\nFleming enrolled for a BSc degree at University College, London, graduated in 1870, and studied under the mathematician Augustus de Morgan and the physicist George Carey Foster. He became a student of chemistry at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington in London (now Imperial College). There he first studied Alessandro Volta's battery, which became the subject of his first scientific paper. This was the first paper to be read to the new Physical Society of London (now the Institute of Physics) and appears on page one of volume one of their Proceedings. Financial problems again forced him to work for a living and in the summer of 1874 he became science master at Cheltenham College, a public school, earning £400 per year. (He later also taught at Rossall School.) His own scientific research continued and he corresponded with James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge University. After saving £400, and securing a grant of £50 a year, in October 1877 at the age of 27, he once again enrolled as a student, this time at Cambridge. He was among the \"two or perhaps three University students who attended Maxwell's last Course\". Maxwell's lectures, he admitted, were difficult to follow. Maxwell, he said, often appeared obscure and had \"a paradoxical and allusive way of speaking\". On occasions Fleming was the only student at those lectures. Fleming again graduated, this time with a First Class Honours degree in chemistry and physics. He then obtained a DSc from London and served one year at Cambridge University as a demonstrator of mechanical engineering before being appointed as the first Professor of Physics and Mathematics at University College Nottingham, but he left after less than a year.\n\nOn 11 June 1887 he married Clara Ripley (1856/7–1917), daughter of Walter Freake Pratt, a solicitor from Bath. On 27 July 1928 he married the popular young singer Olive May Franks (b. 1898/9), of Bristol, daughter of George Franks, a Cardiff businessman.\n\nAfter leaving the University of Nottingham in 1882, Fleming took up the post of \"electrician\" to the Edison Electrical Light Company, advising on lighting systems and the new Ferranti alternating current systems. In 1884 Fleming joined University College London taking up the Chair of Electrical Technology, the first of its kind in England. Although this offered great opportunities, he recalls in his autobiography that the only equipment provided to him was a blackboard and piece of chalk. In 1897 the Pender Laboratory was founding at University College, London and Fleming took up the Pender Chair after the £5000 was endowed as a memorial to John Pender, the founder of Cable and Wireless.\n\nIn 1899 Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radiotelegraphy, decided to attempt transatlantic radio communication. This would require a scale-up in power from the small 200-400 watt transmitters Marconi had used up to then. He contracted Fleming, an expert in power engineering, to design the radio transmitter. Fleming designed the world's first large radio transmitter, a complicated spark transmitter powered by a 25 kW alternator driven by a combustion engine, built at Poldhu in Cornwall, UK, which transmitted the first radio transmission across the Atlantic on 12 December 1901. Although Fleming was responsible for the design, the director of the Marconi Co. had made Fleming agree that: \"If we get across the Atlantic, the main credit will be and must forever be Mr. Marconi's\". Accordingly, the worldwide acclaim that greeted this landmark accomplishment went to Marconi, who only credited Fleming along with several other Marconi employees, saying he did some work on the \"power plant\". Marconi also forgot a promise to give Fleming 500 shares of Marconi stock if the project was successful. Fleming was bitter about his treatment. He honoured his agreement and didn't speak about it throughout Marconi's life, but after his death in 1937 said Marconi had been \"very ungenerous\".\n\nIn 1904, working for the Marconi company to improve transatlantic radio reception, Fleming invented the first thermionic vacuum tube, the two-electrode diode, which he called the oscillation valve, for which he received a patent on 16 November. It became known as the Fleming valve. The Supreme Court of the United States later invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and, additionally, maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed. This invention is often considered to have been the beginning of electronics, for this was the first vacuum tube. Fleming's diode was used in radio receivers and radars for many decades afterwards, until it was superseded by solid state electronic technology more than 50 years later.\nIn 1906, Lee De Forest of the US added a control \"grid\" to the valve to create an amplifying vacuum tube RF detector called the \"Audion\", leading Fleming to accuse him of infringing his patents. De Forest's tube developed into the triode the first electronic amplifier. The triode was vital in the creation of long-distance telephone and radio communications, radars, and early electronic digital computers (mechanical and electro-mechanical digital computers already existed using different technology). The court battle over these patents lasted for many years with victories at different stages for both sides. Fleming also contributed in the fields of photometry, electronics, wireless telegraphy (radio), and electrical measurements. He coined the term Power Factor to describe the true power flowing in an AC power system.\n\nFleming retired from University College, London in 1927 at the age of 77. He remained active, becoming a committed advocate of the new technology of Television which included serving as the second president of the Television Society. He was knighted in 1929, and died at his home in Sidmouth, Devon in 1945. His contributions to electronic communications and radar were of vital importance in winning World War II. Fleming was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor in 1933 for \"the conspicuous part he played in introducing physical and engineering principles into the radio art\". A note from eulogy at the Centenary celebration of the invention of the thermionic valve:\n\nIn November 1905, he patented the \"Fleming Valve\" (). As a rectifying diode, and forerunner to the triode valve and many related structures, it can also be considered to be the device that gave birth to modern electronics.\n\nIn the ensuing years, valves quickly superseded \"cat's whiskers\" and were the main device used to create the electronics industry of today. They remained dominant until the transistor took dominance in the early 1970s.\n\nToday, descendants of the original valve (or vacuum tube) still play an important role in a range of applications. They can be found in the power stages of radio and television transmitters, in musical instrument amplifiers (particularly electric guitar and bass amplifiers), in some high-end audio amplifiers, as detectors of optical and short wavelength radiation, and in sensitive equipment that must be \"radiation-hard\".\n\nIn 1941 the London Power Company commemorated Fleming by naming a new 1,555 GRT coastal collier SS \"Ambrose Fleming\".\n\nOn 27 November 2004 a Blue Plaque presented by the Institute of Physics was unveiled at the Norman Lockyer Observatory, Sidmouth, to mark 100 years since the invention of the Thermionic Radio Valve.\n\nIn 1894 and 1917 Ambrose Fleming was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"The Work of an Electric Current\" and \"Our Useful Servants : Magnetism and Electricity\" respectively.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Electric Lamps and Electric Lighting: A course of four lectures on electric illumination delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain\" (1894) 228 pages, .\nBULLET::::- \"The Alternate Current Transformer in Theory and Practice\" \"The Electrician\" Printing and Publishing Company (1896)\nBULLET::::- \"Magnets and Electric Currents\" E. & F.

A member of the House of Hohenzollern, he was the son of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, and his first wife Magdalena of Saxony.\n\nFaced with large debts accumulated during the reign of his father, John George instituted a grain tax which drove part of the peasantry into dependence on a nobility that was exempt from taxation. Though a staunch Lutheran opposed to the rise of Calvinism, he permitted the admission of Calvinist refugees from the wars in the Spanish Netherlands and France. He was succeeded by his son Joachim Frederick.\n\nUpon the death of his kinsman Albert I, Duke of Prussia in 1568, the Duchy of Prussia was inherited by the latter's underage son Albert Frederick. John George's father was a co-inheritor of the Duchy of Prussia. In 1577 the Brandenburg electors became co-regent with Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia.\n\nJohn George was married three times.\n\nHis first wife was Princess Sophie of Legnica (ca. 1525 – 6 February 1546), whom he married in 1545.

{"id": "16294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16294", "title": "Jahangir", "text": "Jahangir\n\nNur-ud-din Muhammad Salim (Persian: ), known by his imperial name Jahangir (Persian: ) (31 August 1569 – 28 October 1627), was the fourth Mughal Emperor, who ruled from 1605 until his death in 1627. His imperial name (in Persian), means 'conqueror of the world', 'world-conqueror' or 'world-seizer' (\"Jahan\": world; \"gir\": the root of the Persian verb \"gereftan\": to seize, to grab). The tale of his relationship with the Mughal courtesan, Anarkali, has been widely adapted into the literature, art and cinema of India.\n\nPrince Salim, later Jahangir, was born on 31 August 1569, in Fatehpur Sikri, to Akbar and one of his wives Mariam-uz-Zamani, daughter of Raja Bharmal of Amber. Akbar's previous children had died in infancy and he had sought the help of holy men to produce a son. Salim was named for one such man, Shaikh Salim, though Akbar always called him Shekhu Baba.\n\nPrince Salim succeeded to the throne on Thursday, 3 November 1605, eight days after his father's death. Salim ascended to the throne with the title of Nur-ud-din Muhammad Jahangir Badshah Ghazi and thus began his 22-year reign at the age of 36. Jahangir soon after had to fend off his own son, Prince Khusrau Mirza, when the latter attempted to claim the throne based on Akbar's will to become his next heirs. Khusrau Mirza was defeated in 1606 and confined in the fort of Agra. As punishment, Khusrau Mirza was handed over to his younger brother and was partially blinded and killed.\n\nJahangir considered his third son Prince Khurram (future Shah Jahan), his favourite. In 1622, Khurram murdered his blind older brother, Khusrau Mirza, in order to smooth his own path to the throne.\n\nIn 1622, Jahangir sent his son, Prince Khurram, to fight against the combined forces of Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda. After his victory, Khurram turned against his father and made a bid for power. As with the insurrection of his eldest son, Khusrau Mirza, Jahangir was able to defeat the challenge from within his family and retain power.\nIn 1623, Emperor Jahangir sent his \"Tahwildar\", Khan Alam, to Safavid Persia, accompanied by 800 sepoys, scribes and scholars along with ten Howdahs well decorated in gold and silver, in order to negotiate peace with Abbas I of Persia after a brief conflict in the region around Kandahar. Khan Alam soon returned with valuable gifts and groups of \"Mir Shikar\" (Hunt Masters) from both Safavid Persia and the Khanates of Central Asia.\n\nIn 1626, Jahangir began to contemplate an alliance between the Ottomans, Mughals and Uzbeks against the Safavids, who had defeated the Mughals at Kandahar. He even wrote a letter to the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV. Jahangir's ambition did not materialise, however, due to his death in 1627.\n\nSalim was made a Mansabdar of ten thousand (Das-Hazari), the highest military rank of the empire (after the emperor). He independently commanded a regiment in the Kabul campaign of 1581 when he was barely twelve. His Mansab was raised to Twelve Thousand, in 1585, at the time of his betrothal to his cousin Rajkumari Man Bai, daughter of Bhagwant Das of Amer. Bhagwant Das, was the son of Raja Bharmal and the brother of Akbar's Hindu wife and Salim's mother – Mariam-uz-Zamani.\n\nThe marriage with Man Bai took place on 13 February, 1585. Jahangir named her Shah Begum and she gave birth to Khusrau Mirza. Thereafter, Salim married, in quick succession, a number of accomplished girls from the aristocratic Mughal and Rajput families. One of his early favourite wives was a Rajput Princess, Jagat Gosain Begum. Jahangir named her Taj Bibi Bilqis Makani and she gave birth to Prince Khurram, the future Shah Jahan, who was Jahangir's successor to the throne.\n\nOn 7 July, 1586 he married a daughter of Raja Rai Singh, Maharaja of Bikaner. In July 1586, he married Malika Shikar Begum, daughter of Sultan Abu Said Khan Jagatai, Sultan of Kashghar. In 1586, he married Sahib-i-Jamal Begum, daughter of Khwaja Hassan of Herat, a cousin of Zain Khan Koka. In 1587, he married Malika Jahan Begum, daughter of Bhim Singh, Maharaja of Jaisalmer. He also married a daughter of Raja Darya Malbhas. In October 1590, he married Zohra Begum, daughter of Mirza Sanjar Hazara. In 1591, he married Karamnasi Begum, daughter of Raja Kesho Das Rathore of Mertia. On 11 January 1592, he married Kanwal Rani, daughter of Ali Sher Khan, by his wife, Gul Khatun. In October 1592, he married a daughter of Husain Chak of Kashmir. In January/March 1593, he married Nur un-nisa Begum, daughter of Ibrahim Husain Mirza, by his wife, Gulrukh Begum, daughter of Kamran Mirza. In September 1593, he married a daughter of Ali Khan Faruqi, Raja of Khandesh. He also married a daughter of Abdullah Khan Baluch. On 28 June 1596, he married Khas Mahal Begum, daughter of Zain Khan Koka, Subadar of Kabul and Lahore. In 1608, he married Saliha Banu Begum, daughter of Qasim Khan, a senior member of the Imperial Household. On 17 June 1608, he married Koka Kumari Begum, eldest daughter of Jagat Singh, Yuvraj of Amber.\n\nJahangir married the extremely beautiful and intelligent Mehr-un-Nisaa (better known by her subsequent title of Nur Jahan) on 25 May 1611. She was the widow of Sher Afgan. Mehr-un-Nisaa became his indisputable chief consort and favourite wife immediately after their marriage. She was witty, intelligent and beautiful, which was what attracted Jahangir to her. Before being awarded the title of Nur Jahan ('Light of the World'), she was called Nur Mahal ('Light of the Palace'). Her abilities are said to range from fashion designing to hunting. There is also a myth that she had once killed four tigers with six bullets.\n\nMehr-Un-Nisa, or Nur Jahan, occupies an important place in the history of Jahangir. She was the widow of a rebel officer, Sher Afgan, whose actual name was Ali Quli Beg Ist'ajlu. He had earned the title \"Sher Afgan\" (Tiger tosser) from Emperor Akbar after throwing off a tiger that had leaped to attack Akbar on the top of an elephant in a royal hunt at Bengal and then stabbing the fallen tiger to death. Akbar was greatly affected by the bravery of the young Turkish bodyguard accompanying him and awarded him the captaincy of the Imperial Guard at Burdwan, Bengal. Sher Afgan had killed in rebellion (after having learned of Jahangir's orders to have him slain to possess his beautiful wife Mehr Un Nisaa as Jahangir yearned for her much earlier than her wedding to Sher Afgan), the governor of Bengal Qutubuddin Koka who was instructed secretly by Jahangir in his quest and who also was the emperor's foster brother and Sheikh Salim Chishti's grandson and consequently had been slain by the guards of the Governor. The widowed Mehr-Un-Nisaa was brought to Agra along with her nine-year-old daughter and placed in—or refused to be placed in—the Royal harem in 1607. Jahangir married her in 1611 and gave her the title of Nur Jahan or \"Light of the World\". It was rumoured that Jahangir had a hand in the death of her first husband Sher Afghan, albeit there is no recorded evidence to prove that he was guilty of that crime; in fact most travellers' reports say that he met her after Sher Afgan's death. (See Ellison Banks Findly's scholarly biography for a full discussion.)\n\nThe loss of Kandahar was due to Prince Khurram's refusal to obey her orders. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of affairs. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but the latter refused to do so. There is no doubt that the refusal of the prince was due to her behaviour towards him, as she was favouring her son-in-law, Shahryar, at the expense of Khurram. Khurram suspected that in his absence, Shahryar might be given promotion and that he might die on the battlefield. This fear forced Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians, and thereby Kandahar was lost to the Persians. Nur Jahan struck coins in her own name during the last years of Jahangir's reign when he was taken ill.\n\nUnder Jahangir, the empire continued to be a war state attuned to conquest and expansion. Jahangir's most irksome foe was the Rana of Mewar, Amar Singh, who finally surrendered in 1613 to Khurram's forces. In the northeast, the Mughals clashed with the Ahoms of Assam, whose guerilla tactics gave the Mughals a hard time. In Northern India, Jahangir's forces under Khurram defeated their other principal adversary, the Raja of Kangra, in 1615; in the Deccan, his victories further consolidated the empire. But in 1620, Jahangir fell sick, and so ensued the familiar quest for power. Nur Jahan married her daughter to Shahryar, Jahangir's youngest son from his other queen, in the hope of having a living male heir to the throne when Jahangir died.\n\nIn the year 1594, Jahangir was dispatched by his father, the Emperor Akbar, alongside Abu'l-Hasan Asaf Khan, also known as Mirza Jafar Beg son of Mirza Ghiyas Beg Isfahani and brother of Nur Jahan, and Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, to defeat the renegade Vir Singh Deo of Bundela and capture the city of Orchha, which was considered the centre of the revolt. Jahangir arrived with a force of 12,000 after many ferocious encounters and finally subdued the Bundela and ordered Vir Singh Deo to surrender. After tremendous casualties and the start of negotiations between the two, Vir Singh Deo handed over 5000 Bundela infantry and 1000 cavalry, but he feared Mughal retaliation and remained a fugitive until his death. The victorious Jahangir, at 26 years of age, ordered the completion of the Jahangir Mahal a famous Mughal citadel in Orchha to commemorate and honour his victory.\n\nJahangir then gathered his forces under the command of Ali Kuli Khan and fought Lakshmi Narayan of Koch Bihar. Lakshmi Narayan then accepted the Mughals as his suzerains and was given the title \"Nazir\", later establishing a garrison at Atharokotha.\n\nIn 1613, the Portuguese seized the Mughal ship \"Rahimi\", which had set out from Surat on its way with a large cargo of 100,000 rupees and Pilgrims, who were on their way to Mecca and Medina in order to attend the annual Hajj. The \"Rahimi\" was owned by Mariam-uz-Zamani, mother of Jahangir and Akbar's Rajput wife. She was referred to as Queen mother of Hindustan during his reign. \"Rahimi\" was the largest Indian ship sailing in the Red Sea and was known to the Europeans as the \"great pilgrimage ship\". When the Portuguese officially refused to return the ship and the passengers, the outcry at the Mughal court was unusually severe. The outrage was compounded by the fact that the owner and the patron of the ship was none other than the revered mother of the current emperor. Jahangir himself was outraged and ordered the seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. He ordered the apprehension of all Portuguese within the Mughal Empire; he further confiscated churches that belonged to the Jesuits. This episode is considered to be an example of the struggle for wealth that would later ensue and lead to colonisation of the Indian sub-continent.\n\nJahangir was responsible for ending a century long struggle with the state of Mewar. The campaign against the Rajputs was pushed so extensively that they were made to submit with great loss of life and property.\n\nJahangir posted Islam Khan I to subdue Musa Khan, an Afghan rebel in Bengal, in 1608. Jahangir also thought of capturing Kangra Fort, which Akbar had failed to do in 1615. Consequently, a siege was laid and the fort was taken in 1620, which \"resulted in the submission of the Raja of Chamba who was the greatest of all the rajas in the region.\" The district of Kistwar, in the state of Kashmir, was also conquered.\n\nJahangir was trying to restore his health by visiting Kashmir and Kabul. He went from Kabul to Kashmir but decided to return to Lahore because of a severe cold .\n\nJahangir died on the journey from Kashmir to Lahore, near Sarai Saadabad in Bhimber in 1627. To embalm and preserve his body, the entrails were removed; these were buried inside Baghsar Fort near Bhimber in Kashmir. The body was then conveyed by palanquin to Lahore and was buried in Shahdara Bagh, a suburb of that city. The elegant mausoleum is today a popular tourist attraction site.\n\nJahangir was succeeded by his third son, Prince Khurram, who took the regnal name Shah Jahan.\n\nSir Thomas Roe was England's first ambassador to the Mughal court. Relations with England turned tense in 1617 when Roe warned Jahangir that if the young and charismatic Prince Shah Jahan, newly instated as the Subedar of Gujarat, turned the English out of the province, \"\"then he must expect we would do our justice upon the seas\"\". Shah Jahan chose to seal an official Firman allowing the English to trade in Gujarat in the year 1618.\n\nMany contemporary chroniclers were not sure how to describe Jahangir's personal belief structure. Roe labelled him an atheist, and although most others shied away from that term, they did not feel as though they could call him an orthodox Sunni. Roe believed Jahangir's religion to be of his own making, \"for he envies [the Prophet] Mohammed, and wisely sees no reason why he should not bee as great a prophet as he and therefore professed himself so... he hath found many disciples that flatter or follow him.\" At this time, one of those disciples happened to be the current English ambassador, though his initiation into Jahangir's inner circle was devoid of religious significance for Roe, as he did not understand the full extent of what he was doing. Jahangir hung \"a picture of him self set in gold hanging at a wire gold chain\" round Roe's neck. Roe thought it \"an especial favour, for that all the great men that wear the Kings image (which none may do but to whom it is given) receive no other than a medal of gold as big as six pence.\"\n\nHad Roe intentionally converted, it would have caused quite a scandal in London. But since there was no intent, there was no resultant problem. Such disciples were an elite group of imperial servants, with one of them being promoted to Chief Justice. However, it is not clear that any of those who became disciples renounced their previous religion, so it is probable to see this as a way in which the emperor strengthened the bond between himself and his nobles. Despite Roe's somewhat casual use of the term 'atheist', he could not quite put his finger on Jahangir's real beliefs. Roe lamented that the emperor was either \"the most impossible man in the world to be converted, or the most easy; for he loves to hear, and hath so little religion yet, that he can well abide to have any derided.\"\n\nThis should not imply that the multi-confessional state appealed to all, or that all Muslims were happy with the situation in India. In a book written on statecraft for Jahangir, the author advised him to direct \"all his energies to understanding the counsel of the sages and to comprehending the intimations of the 'ulama.\" At the start of his regime many staunch Sunnis were hopeful, because he seemed less tolerant of other faiths than his father had been. At the time of his accession and the elimination of Abu'l Fazl, his father's chief minister and the architect of his eclectic religious stance, a powerful group of orthodox noblemen had gained increased power in the Mughal court. Jahangir did not always regard Hindu customs and rituals benevolently. On visiting a Hindu temple, he found a statue of a man with a pig's head (more than likely a boar's head, a representation of Varaha), one of the idols in the Hindu religion and he \"ordered them to break that hideous form and throw it in the tank.\" If the Tuzuk is reliable on this subject (and there is no reason to suspect that it is not), then this was an isolated case.\n\nJ.F. Richards argues that \"Jahangir seems to have been persistently hostile to popularly venerated religious figures\", which is debatable. A Muslim saint, Mujadid Alif Sani Imam e Rabbani Sheikh Ahmed Sirhindi Al-Farooqi, who had gained a large number of followers through his spiritual preaching, was imprisoned in Gwalior Fort.\n\nMost notorious was the execution of the Sikh Guru Arjan Dev, whom Jahangir had had killed in prison. His lands were confiscated and his sons imprisoned as Jahangir suspected him of helping Khusrau's rebellion. It is unclear whether Jahangir even understood what a Sikh was, referring to Guru Arjan as a Hindu, who had \"captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus and even of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners... for three or four generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm.\" The trigger for Guru Arjan's execution was his support for Jahangir's rebel son Khusrau Mirza, yet it is clear from Jahangir's own memoirs that he disliked Guru Arjan before then: \"many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.\"\n\nMuqarrab Khan sent to Jahangir \"a European curtain (tapestry) the like of which in beauty no other work of the Frank [European] painters has ever been seen.\" One of his audience halls was \"adorned with European screens.\" Christian themes attracted Jahangir, and even merited a mention in the Tuzuk. One of his slaves gave him a piece of ivory into which had been carved four scenes. In the last scene \"there is a tree, below which the figure of the revered (hazrat) Jesus is shown. One person has placed his head at Jesus' feet, and an old man is conversing with Jesus and four others are standing by.\" Though Jahangir believed it to be the work of the slave who presented it to him, Sayyid Ahmad and Henry Beveridge suggest that it was of European origin and possibly showed the Transfiguration. Wherever it came from, and whatever it represented, it was clear that a European style had come to influence Mughal art, otherwise the slave would not have claimed it as his own design, nor would he have been believed by Jahangir.\n\nJahangir was fascinated with art and architecture. Jahangir himself was far from modest in his autobiography when he stated his prowess at being able to determine the artist of any portrait by simply looking at a painting. He also preserved paintings from Emperor Akbar's period. An excellent example of this is the painting of Musician Naubat Khan, son in law of legendary Tansen. It was the work of Ustad Mansur.\nAs he said:\n\nJahangir took his connoisseurship of art very seriously. In addition to their aesthetic qualities, paintings created under his reign were closely catalogued, dated and even signed, providing scholars with fairly accurate ideas as to when and in what context many of the pieces were created.\n\nThe Jesuits had brought with them various books, engravings, and paintings and, when they saw the delight Akbar held for them, sent for more and more of the same to be given to the Mughals. They felt the Mughals were on the \"verge of conversion\", a notion which proved to be very false. Instead, both Akbar and Jahangir studied this artwork very closely and replicated and adapted it, adopting much of the early iconographic features and later the pictorial realism for which Renaissance art was known. Jahangir was notable for his pride in the ability of his court painters. A classic example of this is described in Sir Thomas Roe's diaries, in which the Emperor had his painters copy a European miniature several times creating a total of five miniatures. Jahangir then challenged Roe to pick out the original from the copies, a feat Sir Thomas Roe could not do, to the delight of Jahangir.\n\nJahangir was also revolutionary in his adaptation of European styles. A collection at the British Museum in London contains seventy-four drawings of Indian portraits dating from the time of Jahangir, including a portrait of the emperor himself. These portraits are a unique example of art during Jahangir's reign because faces were not drawn in full, including the shoulders as well as the head as these drawings are.\n\nJahangir is widely considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler. Orientalist Henry Beveridge (editor of the \"Tuzk-e-Jahangiri\") compares Jahangir to the Roman emperor Claudius, for both were \"weak men... in their wrong places as rulers... [and had] Jahangir been head of a Natural History Museum... [he] would have been [a] better and happier man.\" Sir William Hawkins, who visited Jahangir's court in 1609, said: \"In such short that what this man's father, called Ecber Padasha [Padshah Akbar], got of the Deccans, this king, Selim Sha [Jahangir] beginneth to lose.\" Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, who worked under Jahangir's grandson, Dara Shikoh, began his discussion of Jahangir by saying: \"It is a truth tested by experience that sons dissipate what their fathers gained in the sweat of their brow.\"\n\nAccording to John F. Richards, Jahangir's frequent withdrawal to a private sphere of life was partly reflective of his indolence, brought on by his addiction to a considerable daily dosage of wine and opium.\n\nBULLET::::- In the 1939 Hindi film \"Pukar\", Jehangir was portrayed by Chandra Mohan.\nBULLET::::- In the 1953 Hindi film \"Anarkali\", he was portrayed by Pradeep Kumar.\nBULLET::::- In the 1955 Telugu film \"Anarkali\", he was portrayed by ANR\nBULLET::::- In the 1960 Hindi film \"Mughal-e-Azam\", he was portrayed by Dilip Kumar.

{"id": "16295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16295", "title": "Josiah Wedgwood", "text": "Josiah Wedgwood\n\nJosiah Wedgwood (12 July 1730 – 3 January 1795) was an English potter and entrepreneur. He founded the Wedgwood company. He is credited with the industrialisation of the manufacture of pottery; \"it was by intensifying the division of labour that Wedgwood brought about the reduction of cost which enabled his pottery to find markets in all parts of Britain, and also of Europe and America.\" The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion. His expensive goods were in much demand from the nobility, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society. Every new invention that Wedgwood produced – green glaze, creamware, black basalt and jasper – was quickly copied. Having once achieved perfection in production, he achieved perfection in sales and distribution. His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.\n\nMeeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as the inventor of modern marketing. He pioneered direct mail, money back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying patterned boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues.\n\nA prominent abolitionist, Wedgwood is remembered too for his \"\"Am I Not a Man And a Brother?\"\" anti-slavery medallion. He was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family, and he was the grandfather of Charles and Emma Darwin.\n\nBorn in Burslem, Staffordshire, the eleventh and last child of potter Thomas Wedgwood (d. 1739) and Mary Wedgwood (\"née\" Stringer; d. 1766), Josiah was raised within a family of English Dissenters, he was the grandson of a Unitarian minister and was an active Unitarian. By the age of nine, he was proving himself to be a skilled potter. He survived a childhood bout of smallpox to serve as an apprentice potter under his eldest brother Thomas Wedgwood IV. Smallpox left Josiah with a permanently weakened knee, which made him unable to work the foot pedal of a potter's wheel. As a result, he concentrated from an early age on designing pottery and then making it with the input of other potters. The pottery created in his father's and brother's business was inexpensive and low quality, black and mottled in color.\n\nIn his early twenties, Wedgwood began working with the most renowned English pottery-maker of his day, Thomas Whieldon, who eventually became his business partner in 1754. Wedgwood also began to study the new science of chemistry, seeking to understand the materials science of fire, clay, and minerals and to develop better clays and glazes for potter-making. Following an accident in 1762, Wedgwood met Joseph Priestley, another Dissenter and a chemist who gave Wedgwood advice on chemistry.\nWedgwood's experimentation with a wide variety of techniques coincided with the burgeoning of the nearby industrial city of Manchester. Inspired, Wedgwood leased the Ivy Works in the town of Burslem. From 1768 to 1780 he partnered with Thomas Bentley, a businessman from a landowning family who was socially sophisticated and had astute taste. Over the course of the next decade, his experimentation (and a considerable injection of capital from his marriage to a richly endowed distant cousin) transformed the sleepy artisan works into the first true pottery factory.\n\nIn January 1764 Wedgwood married Sarah Wedgwood (1734–1815), his third cousin. They had eight children:\n\nBULLET::::- Susannah Wedgwood (3 January 1765 – 1817) married Robert Darwin and became the mother of the English naturalist Charles Darwin. Charles married Emma Wedgwood, his cousin. The doubled family inheritance of Wedgwood wealth created by his grandfather gave Charles Darwin the leisure time to formulate his theory of evolution.\nBULLET::::- John Wedgwood (1766–1844), joined the business rather reluctantly, mainly interested in horticulture\nBULLET::::- Richard Wedgwood (1767–1768) (died as a child)\nBULLET::::- Josiah Wedgwood II (1769–1843) (father of Emma Darwin, cousin and wife of Charles Darwin)\nBULLET::::- Thomas Wedgwood (1771–1805) (no children), best known as a pioneer photographer\nBULLET::::- Catherine Wedgwood (1774–1823) (no children)\nBULLET::::- Sarah Wedgwood (1776–1856) (no children, very active in the abolition movement)\nBULLET::::- Mary Anne Wedgwood (1778–86) (died as a child)\n\nWedgwood was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.\n\nBy 1763, he was receiving orders from the highest levels of the British nobility, including Queen Charlotte. Wedgwood convinced her to let him name the line of pottery she had purchased \"Queen's Ware\", and trumpeted the royal association in his paperwork and stationery. Anything Wedgwood made for the Queen was automatically exhibited before it was delivered. In 1764, he received his first order from abroad. Wedgwood marketed his Queen's Ware at affordable prices, everywhere in the world British trading ships sailed. In 1767 he wrote, \"The demand for this sd. Creamcolour, Alias, Queen Ware, Alias, Ivory, still increases -- It is amazing how rapidly the use of it has spread all most [sic] over the whole Globe.\" \n\nHe first opened a warehouse at Charles Street, Mayfair in London as early as 1765 and it soon became an integral part of his sales organization. In two years, his trade had outgrown his rooms in Grosvenor Square. In 1767, Wedgwood and Bentley drew up an agreement to divide decorative wares between them, the domestic wares being sold on Wedgwood's behalf. A special display room was built to beguile the fashionable company. Wedgwood's in fact had become one of the most fashionable meeting places in London. His workers had to work day and night to satisfy the demand, and the crowds of visitors showed no sign of abating. The proliferating decoration, the exuberant colours, and the universal gilding of rococo were banished, the splendours of baroque became distasteful; the intricacies of \"chinoiserie\" lost their favour. The demand was for purity, simplicity and antiquity. To encourage this outward spread of fashion and to speed it on its way Wedgwood set up warehouses and showrooms at Bath, Liverpool and Dublin in addition to his showrooms at Etruria and in Westminster. Great care was taken in timing the openings, and new goods were held back to increase their effect.\nThe most important of Wedgwood's early achievements in vase production was the perfection of the black stoneware body, which he called \"basalt\". This body could imitate the colour and shapes of Etruscan or Greek vases which were being excavated in Italy. In 1769, \"vases was all the cry\" in London; he opened a new factory called Etruria, north of Stoke. Wedgwood became what he wished to be: \"Vase Maker General to the Universe\". Around 1771, he started to experiment with Jasperware, but he did not advertise this new product for a couple of years.\n\nSir George Strickland, 6th Baronet, was asked for advice on getting models from Rome. Gilding was to prove unpopular, and around 1772, Wedgwood reduced the amount of \"offensive gilding\" in response to suggestions from Sir William Hamilton. When English society found the uncompromisingly naked figure of the classics \"too warm\" for their taste, and the ardor of the Greek gods too readily apparent, Wedgwood was quick to cloak their pagan immodesty - gowns for the girls and fig leaves for the gods were usually sufficient. Just as he felt that his flowerpots would sell more if they were called \"duches of Devonshire flowerpots\", his creamware more if called Queensware, so he longed for Brown, James Wyatt, and the brothers Adam to lead the architect in the use of his chimney pieces and for George Stubbs to lead the way in the use of Wedgwood plaques.\n\nWedgwood hoped to monopolize the aristocratic market and thus win for his wares a special social \"cachet\" which would filter to all classes of society. Wedgwood fully realised the value of such a lead and made the most of it by giving his pottery the name of its patron: Queensware, Royal Pattern, Russian pattern, Bedford, Oxford and Chetwynd vases for instance. Whether they owned the original or merely possessed a Wedgwood copy mattered little to Wedgwood's customers. In 1773 they published the first \"Ornamental Catalogue\", an illustrated catalogue of shapes. A plaque, in Wedgwood's blue pottery style, marking the site of his London showrooms between 1774 and 1795 in Wedgwood Mews, is located at 12, Greek Street, London, W1.\n\nIn 1773, Empress Catherine the Great ordered the (Green) Frog Service from Wedgwood, consisting of 952 pieces and over a thousand original paintings, for the Kekerekeksinen Palace (\"palace on a frog swamp\" ), later known as Chesme Palace. Most of the painting was carried out in Wedgwood's decorating studio at Chelsea. Its display, Wedgwood thought, 'would bring an immence (sic) number of People of Fashion into our Rooms. For over a month the fashionable world thronged the rooms and blocked the streets with their carriages. (Catharine paid ₤ 2,700. It can still be seen in the Hermitage Museum.) Strictly uneconomical in themselves, the advertising value of these productions were huge. \n\nAs a leading industrialist, Wedgwood was a major backer of the Trent and Mersey Canal dug between the River Trent and River Mersey, during which time he became friends with Erasmus Darwin. Later that decade, his burgeoning business caused him to move from the smaller Ivy Works to the newly built Etruria Works, which would run for 180 years. The factory was named after the Etruria district of Italy, where black porcelain dating to Etruscan times was being excavated. Wedgwood found this porcelain inspiring, and his first major commercial success was its duplication with what he called \"Black Basalt\". He combined experiments in his art and in the technique of mass production with an interest in improved roads, canals, schools and living conditions. At Etruria, he even built a village for his workers.\n\nNot long after the new works opened, continuing trouble with his smallpox-afflicted knee made necessary the amputation of his right leg. In 1780, his long-time business partner Thomas Bentley died, and Wedgwood turned to Darwin for help in running the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, Josiah's eldest daughter would later marry Erasmus' son.\n\nTo clinch his position as leader of the new fashion, he sought out the famous Barberini vase as the final test of his technical skill. Wedgwood's obsession was to duplicate the Portland Vase, a blue-and-white glass vase dating to the first century BC. He worked on the project for three years, eventually producing what he considered a satisfactory copy in 1789.\n\nIn 1784, Wedgwood was exporting nearly 80% of his total produce. By 1790, he had sold his wares in every city in Europe. To give his customers a greater feeling of the rarity of his goods, he strictly limited the number of jaspers on display in his rooms at any given time.\n\nAfter passing on his company to his sons, Wedgwood died at home, probably of cancer of the jaw, in 1795. He was buried three days later in the parish church of Stoke-on-Trent. Seven years later a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons was installed there.\n\nOne of the wealthiest entrepreneurs of the 18th century, Wedgwood created goods to meet the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain. He is credited as the inventor of modern marketing, specifically direct mail, money back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying pattern boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues. Wedgwood is also noted as an early adopter/founder of managerial accounting principles in Anthony Hopwood's \"Archaeology of Accounting Systems.\"\n\nHe was a friend, and commercial rival, of the potter John Turner the elder; their works have sometimes been misattributed. For the further comfort of his foreign buyers he employed French-, German-, Italian- and Dutch-speaking clerks and answered their letters in their native tongue.\n\nWedgwood belonged to the fifth generation of a family of potters whose traditional occupation continued through another five generations. Wedgwood's company is still a famous name in pottery today (as part of Waterford Wedgwood; see Waterford Crystal), and \"Wedgwood China\" is sometimes used as a term for his Jasperware, the coloured stoneware with applied relief decoration (usually white), still common throughout the world.\n\nWedgwood was a prominent slavery abolitionist. His friendship with Thomas Clarkson – abolitionist campaigner and the first historian of the British abolition movement – aroused his interest in slavery. Wedgwood mass-produced cameos depicting the seal for the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade and had them widely distributed, which thereby became a popular and celebrated image. The Wedgwood medallion was the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th-century art. The actual design of the cameo was probably done by either William Hackwood or Henry Webber who were modellers in his Stoke-on-Trent factory.\n\nFrom 1787 until his death in 1795, Josiah Wedgwood actively participated in the abolition-of-slavery cause. His \"Slave Medallion\" brought public attention to abolition. Wedgwood reproduced the design in a cameo with the black figure against a white background and donated hundreds to the society for distribution. Thomas Clarkson wrote; \"ladies wore them in bracelets, and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair. At length the taste for wearing them became general, and thus fashion, which usually confines itself to worthless things, was seen for once in the honorable office of promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom\".\n\nThe design on the medallion became popular and was used elsewhere: large-scale copies were painted to hang on walls and it was used on clay tobacco pipes.\n\nHe was elected to the Royal Society in 1783 for the development of a pyrometer, a device to measure the extremely high temperatures that are found in kilns during the firing of pottery.\n\nHe was an active member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham often held at Erasmus Darwin House and is remembered on the Moonstones in Birmingham.\n\nBULLET::::- Erasmus Darwin House, Erasmus Darwin Museum house and gardens\nBULLET::::- A locomotive named \"Josiah Wedgwood\" ran on the Cheddleton Railway Centre in 1977.

It reorganised the English court system to establish the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and also originally provided for the abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords with respect to England. It would have retained those functions in relation to Scotland and Ireland for the time being. However, the Gladstone Liberal government fell in 1874 before the act entered into force, and the succeeding Disraeli Conservative government suspended the entry into force of the act by means of further acts passed in 1874 and 1875.\n\nOne of the reasons that the Liberal government under Gladstone wanted to abolish the judicial aspect of the House of Lords was that it was concerned for the poor quality of judges at this court. Judges at the House of Lords secured their position by mere virtue of the fact that their fathers were hereditary peers and so individuals would automatically inherit seats in the upper house rather than securing their position through merit. Therefore, some of the best lawyers in the land were prohibited from sitting as judges in the upper house simply because of their parentage.\n\nHowever, under the Conservative government, the 1874 and 1875 Acts retained the judicial aspect of the House of Lords and ensured the quality of judicial appointments to the House of Lords by legislating under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, for the mechanism of law lords. The reigning monarch could appoint any individual to be a peer and thus a judge in the House of Lords. These judicial life peers would hold seats only for the duration of their life; their seat would not pass through their inheritance to their son. Thus, Queen Victoria and subsequent monarchs were able to appoint leading lawyers to adjudicate in the House of Lords by making them life peers.\n\nLord Cairns, Disraeli's Lord Chancellor, sought to remove the House of Lords jurisdiction for Scottish and Irish appeals as well, which would have completely removed its judicial jurisdiction. However, the Lord Chancellor could not muster the necessary support in the Parliament for the bill as originally proposed in 1874 or when it was reintroduced in 1875. Finally, when it became clear that the English legal profession was firmly opposed to the reform proposals, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 removed the provisions for the abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords, although it retained the provisions that established the High Court and the Court of Appeal.\n\nBULLET::::- Judicature Act\nBULLET::::- Judicature Acts (1873 and 1875)\n\nBULLET::::- The Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 at the UK Parliament website\n\nBULLET::::- O'Keefe, David. \"Sir George Jessel and the Union of Judicature.\" \"American Journal of Legal History\" 26 (1982): 227+.\n"}
{"id": "16300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16300", "title": "Julian (emperor)", "text": "Julian (emperor)\n\nJulian, rarely Julian II (, ; 331/332 – 26 June 363), was Roman Emperor from 361 to 363, as well as a notable philosopher and author in Greek. His rejection of Christianity, and his promotion of Neoplatonic Hellenism in its place, caused him to be remembered as Julian the Apostate by the Christian church. \n\nA member of the Constantinian dynasty, Julian was orphaned as a child. He was raised by the Gothic slave Mardonius, who had a profound influence on him, providing Julian with an excellent education. Julian became \"caesar\" over the western provinces by order of Constantius II in 355, and in this role he campaigned successfully against the Alamanni and Franks. Most notable was his crushing victory over the Alamanni at the Battle of Argentoratum (Strasbourg) in 357, leading his 13,000 men against a Germanic army three times larger. In 360, Julian was proclaimed \"Augustus\" by his soldiers at Lutetia (Paris), sparking a civil war with Constantius. However, Constantius died before the two could face each other in battle, and named Julian as his successor.\n\nIn 363, Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the Sassanid Empire. The campaign was initially successful, securing a victory outside Ctesiphon. However, while campaigning into Persian territory, the Persians flooded the area behind him and Julian took a risky decision to withdraw up the valley of the Tigris River. During the Battle of Samarra, Julian was mortally wounded under mysterious circumstances, leaving his army trapped in Persian territory. Following his death, the Roman forces were obliged to cede territory in order to escape, including the fortress city of Nisibis.\n\nJulian was a man of unusually complex character: he was \"the military commander, the theosophist, the social reformer, and the man of letters\". He was the last non-Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, and he believed that it was necessary to restore the Empire's ancient Roman values and traditions in order to save it from dissolution. He purged the top-heavy state bureaucracy, and attempted to revive traditional Roman religious practices at the expense of Christianity. His attempt to build a Third Temple in Jerusalem was probably intended to harm Christianity rather than please Jews. Julian also forbade the Christians from teaching and learning classical texts. \n\nFlavius Claudius Julianus was born at Constantinople in May or June 332, the son of Julius Constantius, consul in 335 and half-brother of the emperor Constantine, by his second wife, Basilina, a woman of Greek origin. Both of his parents were Christians. Julian's paternal grandparents were the emperor Constantius Chlorus and his second wife, Flavia Maximiana Theodora. His maternal grandfather was Julius Julianus, Praetorian Prefect of the East under the emperor Licinius from 315 to 324, and consul \"suffectus\" in 325. The name of Julian's maternal grandmother is unknown.\n\nIn the turmoil after the death of Constantine in 337, in order to establish himself and his brothers, Julian's zealous Arian cousin Constantius II appears to have led a massacre of most of Julian's close relatives. Constantius II allegedly ordered the murders of many descendants from the second marriage of Constantius Chlorus and Theodora, leaving only Constantius and his brothers Constantine II and Constans I, and their cousins, Julian and Gallus (Julian's half-brother), as the surviving males related to Emperor Constantine. Constantius II, Constans I, and Constantine II were proclaimed joint emperors, each ruling a portion of Roman territory. Julian and Gallus were excluded from public life, were strictly guarded in their youth, and given a Christian education. They were likely saved by their youth and at the urging of the Empress Eusebia. If Julian's later writings are to be believed, Constantius would later be tormented with guilt at the massacre of 337.\n\nInitially growing up in Bithynia, raised by his maternal grandmother, at the age of seven Julian was under the guardianship of Eusebius of Nicomedia, the semi-Arian Christian Bishop of Nicomedia, and taught by Mardonius, a Gothic eunuch, about whom he later wrote warmly. After Eusebius died in 342, both Julian and Gallus were exiled to the imperial estate of Macellum in Cappadocia. Here Julian met the Christian bishop George of Cappadocia, who lent him books from the classical tradition. At the age of 18, the exile was lifted and he dwelt briefly in Constantinople and Nicomedia. He became a lector, a minor office in the Christian church, and his later writings show a detailed knowledge of the Bible, likely acquired in his early life.\n\nJulian's conversion from Christianity to paganism happened at around the age of 20. Looking back on his life in 362, Julian wrote that he had spent twenty years in the way of Christianity and twelve in the true way, i.e., the way of Helios. Julian began his study of Neoplatonism in Asia Minor in 351, at first under Aedesius, the philosopher, and then Aedesius' student Eusebius of Myndus. It was from Eusebius that Julian learned of the teachings of Maximus of Ephesus, whom Eusebius criticized for his more mystical form of Neoplatonic theurgy. Eusebius related his meeting with Maximus, in which the theurgist invited him into the temple of Hecate and, chanting a hymn, caused a statue of the goddess to smile and laugh, and her torches to ignite. Eusebius reportedly told Julian that he \"must not marvel at any of these things, even as I marvel not, but rather believe that the thing of the highest importance is that purification of the soul which is attained by reason.\" In spite of Eusebius' warnings regarding the \"impostures of witchcraft and magic that cheat the senses\" and \"the works of conjurers who are insane men led astray into the exercise of earthly and material powers\", Julian was intrigued, and sought out Maximus as his new mentor. According to the historian Eunapius, when Julian left Eusebius, he told his former teacher \"farewell, and devote yourself to your books. You have shown me the man I was in search of.\"\n\nJulian was summoned to Constantius' court in Mediolanum (Milan) in 354 and kept there for a year; in the summer and fall of 355, he was permitted to study in Athens. While there, Julian became acquainted with two men who later became both bishops and saints: Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil the Great. In the same period, Julian was also initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, which he would later try to restore.\n\nConstantine II died in 340 when he attacked his brother Constans. Constans in turn fell in 350 in the war against the usurper Magnentius. This left Constantius II as the sole remaining emperor. In need of support, in 351 he made Julian's half-brother, Gallus, caesar of the East, while Constantius II himself turned his attention westward to Magnentius, whom he defeated decisively that year. In 354 Gallus, who had imposed a rule of terror over the territories under his command, was executed. Julian was summoned to court, and held for a year, under suspicion of treasonable intrigue, first with his brother and then with Claudius Silvanus; he was cleared, in part because Empress Eusebia intervened on his behalf, and he was sent to Athens. (Julian expresses his gratitude to the empress in his third oration.)\n\nAfter dealing with the rebellions of Magnentius and Silvanus, Constantius felt he needed a permanent representative in Gaul. In 355, Julian was summoned to appear before the emperor in Mediolanum and on 6 November was made caesar of the West, marrying Constantius' sister, Helena. Constantius, after his experience with Gallus, intended his representative to be more a figurehead than an active participant in events, so he packed Julian off to Gaul with a small retinue, assuming his prefects in Gaul would keep Julian in check. At first reluctant to trade his scholarly life for war and politics, Julian eventually took every opportunity to involve himself in the affairs of Gaul. In the following years he learned how to lead and then run an army, through a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes that had settled on both sides of the Rhine.\n\nIn 356 during his first campaign he led an army to the Rhine, engaged the inhabitants there and won back several towns that had fallen into Frankish hands, including Colonia Agrippina (Cologne). With success under his belt he withdrew for the winter to Gaul, distributing his forces to protect various towns, and choosing the small town of Senon near Verdun to await the spring. This turned out to be a tactical error, for he was left with insufficient forces to defend himself when a large contingent of Franks besieged the town and Julian was virtually held captive there for several months, until his general Marcellus deigned to lift the siege. Relations between Julian and Marcellus seem to have been poor. Constantius accepted Julian's report of events and Marcellus was replaced as \"magister equitum\" by Severus.\n\nThe following year saw a combined operation planned by Constantius to regain control of the Rhine from the Germanic peoples who had spilt across the river onto the west bank. From the south his \"magister peditum\" Barbatio was to come from Milan and amass forces at Augst (near the Rhine bend), then set off north with 25,000 soldiers; Julian with 13,000 troops would move east from Durocortorum (Rheims). However, while Julian was in transit, a group of Laeti attacked Lugdunum (Lyon) and Julian was delayed in order to deal with them. This left Barbatio unsupported and deep in Alamanni territory, so he felt obliged to withdraw, retracing his steps. Thus ended the coordinated operation against the Germanic peoples.\n\nWith Barbatio safely out of the picture, King Chnodomarius led a confederation of Alamanni forces against Julian and Severus at the Battle of Argentoratum. The Romans were heavily outnumbered and during the heat of battle a group of 600 horsemen on the right wing deserted, yet, taking full advantage of the limitations of the terrain, the Romans were overwhelmingly victorious. The enemy was routed and driven into the river. King Chnodomarius was captured and later sent to Constantius in Milan. Ammianus, who was a participant in the battle, portrays Julian in charge of events on the battlefield and describes how the soldiers, because of this success, acclaimed Julian attempting to make him Augustus, an acclamation he rejected, rebuking them. He later rewarded them for their valor.\n\nRather than chase the routed enemy across the Rhine, Julian now proceeded to follow the Rhine north, the route he followed the previous year on his way back to Gaul. At Moguntiacum (Mainz), however, he crossed the Rhine in an expedition that penetrated deep into what is today Germany, and forced three local kingdoms to submit. This action showed the Alamanni that Rome was once again present and active in the area. On his way back to winter quarters in Paris he dealt with a band of Franks who had taken control of some abandoned forts along the Meuse River.\n\nIn 358, Julian gained victories over the Salian Franks on the Lower Rhine, settling them in Toxandria in the Roman Empire, north of today's city of Tongeren, and over the Chamavi, who were expelled back to Hamaland.\n\nAt the end of 357 Julian, with the prestige of his victory over the Alamanni to give him confidence, prevented a tax increase by the Gallic praetorian prefect Florentius and personally took charge of the province of \"Belgica Secunda\". This was Julian's first experience with civil administration, where his views were influenced by his liberal education in Greece. Properly it was a role that belonged to the praetorian prefect. However, Florentius and Julian often clashed over the administration of Gaul. Julian's first priority, as caesar and nominal ranking commander in Gaul, was to drive out the barbarians who had breached the Rhine frontier. However, he sought to win over the support of the civil population, which was necessary for his operations in Gaul and also to show his largely Germanic army the benefits of Imperial rule. He therefore felt it was necessary to rebuild stable and peaceful conditions in the devastated cities and countryside. For this reason, Julian clashed with Florentius over the latter's support of tax increases, as mentioned above, and Florentius's own corruption in the bureaucracy.\n\nConstantius attempted to maintain some modicum of control over his caesar, which explains his removal of Julian's close adviser Saturninius Secundus Salutius from Gaul. His departure stimulated the writing of Julian's oration, \"Consolation Upon the Departure of Salutius\".\n\nIn the fourth year of Julian's stay in Gaul, the Sassanid Emperor, Shapur II, invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of Amida after a 73-day siege. In February 360, Constantius II ordered more than half of Julian's Gallic troops to join his eastern army, the order by-passing Julian and going directly to the military commanders. Although Julian at first attempted to expedite the order, it provoked an insurrection by troops of the \"Petulantes\", who had no desire to leave Gaul. According to the historian Zosimus, the army officers were those responsible for distributing an anonymous tract expressing complaints against Constantius as well as fearing for Julian's ultimate fate. Notably absent at the time was the prefect Florentius, who was seldom far from Julian's side, though now he was kept busy organizing supplies in Vienne and away from any strife that the order could cause. Julian would later blame him for the arrival of the order from Constantius. Ammianus Marcellinus even suggested that the fear of Julian gaining more popularity than himself caused Constantius to send the order on the urging of Florentius.\n\nThe troops proclaimed Julian \"Augustus\" in Paris, and this in turn led to a very swift military effort to secure or win the allegiance of others. Although the full details are unclear, there is evidence to suggest that Julian may have at least partially stimulated the insurrection. If so, he went back to business as usual in Gaul, for, from June to August of that year, Julian led a successful campaign against the Attuarian Franks. In November, Julian began openly using the title \"Augustus,\" even issuing coins with the title, sometimes with Constantius, sometimes without. He celebrated his fifth year in Gaul with a big show of games.\n\nIn the spring of 361, Julian led his army into the territory of the Alamanni, where he captured their king, Vadomarius. Julian claimed that Vadomarius had been in league with Constantius, encouraging him to raid the borders of Raetia. Julian then divided his forces, sending one column to Raetia, one to northern Italy and the third he led down the Danube on boats. His forces claimed control of Illyricum and his general, Nevitta, secured the pass of Succi into Thrace. He was now well out of his comfort zone and on the road to civil war. (Julian would state in late November that he set off down this road \"because, having been declared a public enemy, I meant to frighten him [Constantius] merely, and that our quarrel should result in intercourse on more friendly terms...\")\n\nHowever, in June, forces loyal to Constantius captured the city of Aquileia on the north Adriatic coast, an event that threatened to cut Julian off from the rest of his forces, while Constantius's troops marched towards him from the east. Aquileia was subsequently besieged by 23,000 men loyal to Julian. All Julian could do was sit it out in Naissus, the city of Constantine's birth, waiting for news and writing letters to various cities in Greece justifying his actions (of which only the letter to the Athenians has survived in its entirety). Civil war was avoided only by the death on November 3 of Constantius, who, in his last will, is alleged by some sources to have recognized Julian as his rightful successor.\n\nOn December 11, 361, Julian entered Constantinople as sole emperor and, despite his rejection of Christianity, his first political act was to preside over Constantius' Christian burial, escorting the body to the Church of the Apostles, where it was placed alongside that of Constantine. This act was a demonstration of his lawful right to the throne. He is also now thought to have been responsible for the building of Santa Costanza on a Christian site just outside Rome as a mausoleum for his wife Helena and sister-in-law Constantina.\n\nThe new Emperor rejected the style of administration of his immediate predecessors. He blamed Constantine for the state of the administration and for having abandoned the traditions of the past. He made no attempt to restore the tetrarchal system begun under Diocletian. Nor did he seek to rule as an absolute autocrat. His own philosophic notions led him to idealize the reigns of Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. In his first panegyric to Constantius, Julian described the ideal ruler as being essentially \"primus inter pares\" (\"first among equals\"), operating under the same laws as his subjects. While in Constantinople therefore it was not strange to see Julian frequently active in the Senate, participating in debates and making speeches, placing himself at the level of the other members of the Senate.\n\nHe viewed the royal court of his predecessors as inefficient, corrupt, and expensive. Thousands of servants, eunuchs, and superfluous officials were therefore summarily dismissed. He set up the Chalcedon tribunal to deal with the corruption of the previous administration under the supervision of \"Magister Militum\" Arbitio. Several high-ranking officials under Constantius, including the chamberlain Eusebius, were found guilty and executed. (Julian was conspicuously absent from the proceedings, perhaps signaling his displeasure at their necessity.) He continually sought to reduce what he saw as a burdensome and corrupt bureaucracy within the Imperial administration whether it involved civic officials, the secret agents, or the imperial post service.\n\nAnother effect of Julian's political philosophy was that the authority of the cities was expanded at the expense of the imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the \"aurum coronarium\" was made voluntary rather than a compulsory tax. Additionally, arrears of land taxes were cancelled. This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself. Forgiving back taxes both made Julian more popular and allowed him to increase collections of current taxes.\n\nWhile he ceded much of the authority of the imperial government to the cities, Julian also took more direct control himself. For example, new taxes and corvées had to be approved by him directly rather than left to the judgment of the bureaucratic apparatus. Julian certainly had a clear idea of what he wanted Roman society to be, both in political as well as religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire. If the cities were treated as relatively autonomous local administrative areas, it would simplify the problems of imperial administration, which as far as Julian was concerned, should be focused on the administration of the law and defense of the empire's vast frontiers.\n\nIn replacing Constantius's political and civil appointees, Julian drew heavily from the intellectual and professional classes, or kept reliable holdovers, such as the rhetorician Themistius. His choice of consuls for the year 362 was more controversial. One was the very acceptable Claudius Mamertinus, previously the Praetorian prefect of Illyricum. The other, more surprising choice was Nevitta, Julian's trusted Frankish general. This latter appointment made overt the fact that an emperor's authority depended on the power of the army. Julian's choice of Nevitta appears to have been aimed at maintaining the support of the Western army which had acclaimed him.\n\nAfter five months of dealings at the capital, Julian left Constantinople in May and moved to Antioch, arriving in mid-July and staying there for nine months before launching his fateful campaign against Persia in March 363. Antioch was a city favored by splendid temples along with a famous oracle of Apollo in nearby Daphne, which may have been one reason for his choosing to reside there. It had also been used in the past as a staging place for amassing troops, a purpose which Julian intended to follow.\n\nHis arrival on 18 July was well received by the Antiochenes, though it coincided with the celebration of the \"Adonia\", a festival which marked the death of Adonis, so there was wailing and moaning in the streets—not a good omen for an arrival.\n\nJulian soon discovered that wealthy merchants were causing food problems, apparently by hoarding food and selling it at high prices. He hoped that the curia would deal with the issue for the situation was headed for a famine. When the curia did nothing, he spoke to the city's leading citizens, trying to persuade them to take action. Thinking that they would do the job, he turned his attention to religious matters.\n\nHe tried to resurrect the ancient oracular spring of Castalia at the temple of Apollo at Daphne. After being advised that the bones of 3rd-century bishop Babylas were suppressing the god, he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.\n\nWhen the curia still took no substantial action in regards to the food shortage, Julian intervened, fixing the prices for grain and importing more from Egypt. Then landholders refused to sell theirs, claiming that the harvest was so bad that they had to be compensated with fair prices. Julian accused them of price gouging and forced them to sell. Various parts of Libanius' orations may suggest that both sides were justified to some extent while Ammianus blames Julian for \"a mere thirst for popularity\".\n\nJulian's ascetic lifestyle was not popular either, since his subjects were accustomed to the idea of an all-powerful Emperor who placed himself well above them. Nor did he improve his dignity with his own participation in the ceremonial of bloody sacrifices.\nDavid S. Potter, an assistant secretary of the US Navy, said after nearly two millennia:\nHe then tried to address public criticism and mocking of him by issuing a satire ostensibly on himself, called Misopogon or \"Beard Hater\". There he blames the people of Antioch for preferring that their ruler have his virtues in the face rather than in the soul.\n\nEven Julian's intellectual friends and fellow pagans were of a divided mind about this habit of talking to his subjects on an equal footing: Ammianus Marcellinus saw in that only the foolish vanity of someone \"excessively anxious for empty distinction\", whose \"desire for popularity often led him to converse with unworthy persons\".\n\nOn leaving Antioch he appointed Alexander of Heliopolis as governor, a violent and cruel man whom the Antiochene Libanius, a friend of the emperor, admits on first thought was a \"dishonourable\" appointment. Julian himself described the man as \"undeserving\" of the position, but appropriate \"for the avaricious and rebellious people of Antioch\".\n\nJulian's rise to Augustus was the result of military insurrection eased by Constantius's sudden death. This meant that, while he could count on the wholehearted support of the Western army which had aided his rise, the Eastern army was an unknown quantity originally loyal to the Emperor he had risen against, and he had tried to woo it through the Chalcedon tribunal. However, to solidify his position in the eyes of the eastern army, he needed to lead its soldiers to victory and a campaign against the Sassanid Persians offered such an opportunity.\n\nAn audacious plan was formulated whose goal was to lay siege on the Sassanid capital city of Ctesiphon and definitively secure the eastern border. Yet the full motivation for this ambitious operation is, at best, unclear. There was no direct necessity for an invasion, as the Sassanids sent envoys in the hope of settling matters peacefully. Julian rejected this offer. Ammianus states that Julian longed for revenge on the Persians and that a certain desire for combat and glory also played a role in his decision to go to war.\n\nOn 5 March 363, despite a series of omens against the campaign, Julian departed from Antioch with about 65,000–83,000, or 80,000–90,000 men (the traditional number accepted by Gibbon is 95,000 effectives total), and headed north toward the Euphrates. En route he was met by embassies from various small powers offering assistance, none of which he accepted. He did order the Armenian King Arsaces to muster an army and await instructions. He crossed the Euphrates near Hierapolis and moved eastward to Carrhae, giving the impression that his chosen route into Persian territory was down the Tigris. For this reason it seems he sent a force of 30,000 soldiers under Procopius and Sebastianus further eastward to devastate Media in conjunction with Armenian forces. This was where two earlier Roman campaigns had concentrated and where the main Persian forces were soon directed. Julian's strategy lay elsewhere, however. He had had a fleet built of over 1,000 ships at Samosata in order to supply his army for a march down the Euphrates and of 50 pontoon ships to facilitate river crossings. Procopius and the Armenians would march down the Tigris to meet Julian near Ctesiphon. Julian's ultimate aim seems to have been \"regime change\" by replacing king Shapur II with his brother Hormisdas.\n\nAfter feigning a march further eastward, Julian's army turned south to Circesium at the confluence of the Abora (Khabur) and the Euphrates arriving at the beginning of April. Passing Dura on April 6, the army made good progress, bypassing towns after negotiations or besieging those which chose to oppose him. At the end of April the Romans captured the fortress of Pirisabora, which guarded the canal approach from the Euphrates to Ctesiphon on the Tigris. As the army marched toward the Persian capital, the Sassanids broke the dikes which crossed the land, turning it into marshland, slowing the progress of the Roman army.\n\nBy mid-May, the army had reached the vicinity of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night. The Romans gained a tactical victory over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city. However, the Persian capital was not taken, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective. In the council of war which followed, Julian's generals persuaded him not to mount a siege against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force. Julian not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet. This proved to be a hasty decision, for they were on the wrong side of the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans' path. Julian had not brought adequate siege equipment, so there was nothing he could do when he found that the Persians had flooded the area behind him, forcing him to withdraw. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through Mesopotamia, but northward to Corduene.\n\nDuring the withdrawal, Julian's forces suffered several attacks from Sassanid forces. In one such engagement on 26 June 363, the indecisive Battle of Samarra near Maranga, Julian was wounded when the Sassanid army raided his column. In the haste of pursuing the retreating enemy, Julian chose speed rather than caution, taking only his sword and leaving his coat of mail. He received a wound from a spear that reportedly pierced the lower lobe of his liver, the peritoneum and intestines. The wound was not immediately deadly. Julian was treated by his personal physician, Oribasius of Pergamum, who seems to have made every attempt to treat the wound. This probably included the irrigation of the wound with a dark wine, and a procedure known as \"gastrorrhaphy\", the suturing of the damaged intestine. On the third day a major hemorrhage occurred and the emperor died during the night. As Julian wished, his body was buried outside Tarsus, though it was later removed to Constantinople.\n\nIn 364, Libanius stated that Julian was assassinated by a Christian who was one of his own soldiers; this charge is not corroborated by Ammianus Marcellinus or other contemporary historians. John Malalas reports that the supposed assassination was commanded by Basil of Caesarea. Fourteen years later, Libanius said that Julian was killed by a Saracen (Lakhmid) and this may have been confirmed by Julian's doctor Oribasius who, having examined the wound, said that it was from a spear used by a group of Lakhmid auxiliaries in Persian service. Later Christian historians propagated the tradition that Julian was killed by Saint Mercurius. Julian was succeeded by the short-lived Emperor Jovian who reestablished Christianity's privileged position throughout the Empire.\n\nLibanius says in his epitaph of the deceased emperor (18.304) that \"I have mentioned representations (of Julian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honour him as they do the gods. Already a blessing has been besought of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from him themselves.\" However, no similar action was taken by the Roman central government, which would be more and more dominated by Christians in the ensuing decades.\n\nConsidered apocryphal is the report that his dying words were , or (\"You have won, Galilean\"), supposedly expressing his recognition that, with his death, Christianity would become the Empire's state religion. The phrase introduces the 1866 poem \"Hymn to Proserpine\", which was Algernon Charles Swinburne's elaboration of what a philosophic pagan might have felt at the triumph of Christianity. It also ends the Polish Romantic play \"The Undivine comedy\" written in 1833 by Zygmunt Krasiński.\n\nAs he had requested, Julian's body was buried in Tarsus. It lay in a tomb outside the city, across a road from that of Maximinus Daia.\n\nHowever, chronicler Zonaras says that at some \"later\" date his body was exhumed and reburied in or near the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, where Constantine and the rest of his family lay. His sarcophagus is listed as standing in a \"stoa\" there by Constantine Porphyrogenitus. The church was demolished by the Ottoman Turks after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Today a sarcophagus of porphyry, identified as Julian's, stands in the grounds of the Archaeological Museum in Istanbul.\n\nJulian's personal religion was both pagan and philosophical; he viewed the traditional myths as allegories, in which the ancient gods were aspects of a philosophical divinity. The chief surviving sources are his works \"To King Helios\" and \"To the Mother of the Gods\", which were written as panegyrics, not theological treatises.\n\nAs the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire, Julian's beliefs are of great interest for historians, but they are not in complete agreement. He learned theurgy from Maximus of Ephesus, a student of Iamblichus; his system bears some resemblance to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus; Polymnia Athanassiadi has brought new attention to his relations with Mithraism, although whether he was initiated into it remains debatable; and certain aspects of his thought (such as his reorganization of paganism under High Priests, and his fundamental monotheism) may show Christian influence. Some of these potential sources have not come down to us, and all of them influenced each other, which adds to the difficulties.\n\nAccording to one theory (that of G.W. Bowersock in particular), Julian's paganism was highly eccentric and atypical because it was heavily influenced by an esoteric approach to Platonic philosophy sometimes identified as \"theurgy\" and also \"Neoplatonism\". Others (Rowland Smith, in particular) have argued that Julian's philosophical perspective was nothing unusual for a \"cultured\" pagan of his time, and, at any rate, that Julian's paganism was not limited to philosophy alone, and that he was deeply devoted to the same gods and goddesses as other pagans of his day.\n\nBecause of his Neoplatonist background Julian accepted the creation of humanity as described in Plato's \"Timaeus\". Julian writes, \"when Zeus was setting all things in order there fell from him drops of sacred blood, and from them, as they say, arose the race of men.\" Further he writes, \"they who had the power to create one man and one woman only, were able to create many men and women at once...\" His view contrasts with the Christian belief that humanity is derived from the one pair, Adam and Eve. Elsewhere he argues against the single pair origin, indicating his disbelief, noting for example, \"how very different in their bodies are the Germans and Scythians from the Libyans and Ethiopians.\"\n\nThe Christian historian Socrates Scholasticus was of the opinion that Julian believed himself to be Alexander the Great \"in another body\" via transmigration of souls, \"in accordance with the teachings of Pythagoras and Plato\".\n\nThe diet of Julian is said to have been predominantly vegetable-based.\n\nAfter gaining the purple, Julian started a religious reformation of the empire, which was intended to restore the lost strength of the Roman state. He supported the restoration of Hellenistic polytheism as the state religion. His laws tended to target wealthy and educated Christians, and his aim was not to destroy Christianity but to drive the religion out of \"the governing classes of the empire — much as Buddhism was driven back into the lower classes by a revived Confucian mandarinate in 13th century China.\"\n\nHe restored pagan temples which had been confiscated since Constantine's time, or simply appropriated by wealthy citizens; he repealed the stipends that Constantine had awarded to Christian bishops, and removed their other privileges, including a right to be consulted on appointments and to act as private courts. He also reversed some favors that had previously been given to Christians. For example, he reversed Constantine's declaration that Majuma, the port of Gaza, was a separate city. Majuma had a large Christian congregation while Gaza was still predominantly pagan.\n\nOn 4 February 362, Julian promulgated an edict to guarantee freedom of religion. This edict proclaimed that all the religions were equal before the law, and that the Roman Empire had to return to its original religious eclecticism, according to which the Roman state did not impose any religion on its provinces. The edict was seen as an act of favor toward the Jews, in order to upset the Christians.\n\nSince the persecution of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian's actions were designed to harass Christians and undermine their ability to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire. Julian's preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus' theurgy seems to have convinced him that it was right to outlaw the practice of the Christian view of theurgy and demand the suppression of the Christian set of Mysteries.\n\nIn his \"School Edict\" Julian required that all public teachers be approved by the Emperor; the state paid or supplemented much of their salaries. Ammianus Marcellinus explains this as intending to prevent Christian teachers from using pagan texts (such as the \"Iliad\", which was widely regarded as divinely inspired) that formed the core of classical education: \"If they want to learn literature, they have Luke and Mark: Let them go back to their churches and expound on them\", the edict says. This was an attempt to remove some of the influence of the Christian schools which at that time and later used ancient Greek literature in their teachings in their effort to present the Christian religion as being superior to paganism. The edict also dealt a severe financial blow to many Christian scholars, tutors and teachers, as it deprived them of students.\n\nIn his \"Tolerance Edict\" of 362, Julian decreed the reopening of pagan temples, the restitution of confiscated temple properties, and the return from exile of dissident Christian bishops. The latter was an instance of tolerance of different religious views, but it may also have attempt by Julian to foster schisms and divisions between different Christian sects, since conflict between rival Christian sects was quite fierce.\n\nHis care in the institution of a pagan hierarchy in opposition to that of the Christians was due to his wish to create a society in which every aspect of the life of the citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor — the final provider for all the needs of his people. Within this project, there was no place for a parallel institution, such as the Christian hierarchy or Christian charity.\n\nJulian's popularity among the people and the army during his brief reign suggest that he might have brought paganism back to the fore of Roman public and private life. In fact, during his lifetime, neither pagan nor Christian ideology reigned supreme, and the greatest thinkers of the day argued about the merits and rationality of each religion. Most importantly for the pagan cause, though, Rome was still a predominantly pagan empire that had not wholly accepted Christianity.\nEven so, Julian's short reign did not stem the tide of Christianity. The emperor's ultimate failure can arguably be attributed to the manifold religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one ‘pagan religion.’ Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians to lump together the believers of a system they opposed. In truth, there was no Roman religion, as modern observers would recognize it. Instead, paganism came from a system of observances that one historian has characterized as “no more than a spongy mass of tolerance and tradition.”\n\nThis system of tradition had already shifted dramatically by the time Julian came to power; gone were the days of massive sacrifices honoring the gods. The communal festivals that involved sacrifice and feasting, which once united communities, now tore them apart—Christian against pagan. Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds) had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church. In all, Julian's short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past. Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation to rock the boat by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.\n\nAfter witnessing the reign of two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, it is understandable that pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian's attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion with some of the same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian's attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism's system of tradition.\n\nIndeed, this development of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian's persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally changed the nature of pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had been only a system of tradition.\n\nDespite this inadvertent reconciliation of paganism to Christianity, however, many of the Church fathers viewed the emperor with hostility, and told stories of his supposed wickedness after his death. A sermon by Saint John Chrysostom, entitled \"On Saints Juventinus and Maximinus,\" tells the story of two of Julian's soldiers at Antioch, who were overheard at a drinking party, criticizing the emperor's religious policies, and taken into custody. According to John, the emperor had made a deliberate effort to avoid creating martyrs of those who disagreed with his reforms; but Juventinus and Maximinus admitted to being Christians, and refused to moderate their stance. John asserts that the emperor forbade anyone from having contact with the men, but that nobody obeyed his orders; so he had the two men executed in the middle of the night. John urges his audience to visit the tomb of these martyrs.\n\nThe fact that Christian charities were open to all, including pagans, put this aspect of Roman citizens' lives out of the control of Imperial authority and under that of the Church. Thus Julian envisioned the institution of a Roman philanthropic system, and cared for the behaviour and the morality of the pagan priests, in the hope that it would mitigate the reliance of pagans on Christian charity, saying: \"\"These impious Galileans not only feed their own poor, but ours also; welcoming them into their agapae, they attract them, as children are attracted, with cakes.\"\"\n\nIn 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Persia, in keeping with his effort to foster religions other than Christianity, he ordered the Temple rebuilt. Fires breaking out stopped this. A personal friend of his, Ammianus Marcellinus, wrote this about the effort:\n\nThe failure to rebuild the Temple has been ascribed to the Galilee earthquake of 363. Although there is contemporary testimony for the miracle, in the Orations of St. Gregory Nazianzen, this may be taken to be unreliable. Sabotage by Christians is a possibility, as is an accidental fire. Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time. Julian's support of Jews caused Jews to call him \"Julian the Hellene\".\n\nJulian wrote several works in Greek, some of which have come down to us.\n\n!Budé\n! Date\n! Work\n! Comment\n!Wright\nBULLET::::- Budé indicates the numbers used by Athanassiadi given in the Budé edition (1963 & 1964) of Julian's \"Opera\".\nBULLET::::- Wright indicates the oration numbers provided in W.C.Wright's edition of Julian's works.\n\nThe religious works contain involved philosophical speculations, and the panegyrics to Constantius are formulaic and elaborate in style.\n\nThe \"Misopogon\" (or \"Beard Hater\") is a light-hearted account of his clash with the inhabitants of Antioch after he was mocked for his beard and generally scruffy appearance for an Emperor. \"The Caesars\" is a humorous tale of a contest among some of the most notable Roman Emperors: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Constantine, and also Alexander the Great. This was a satiric attack upon the recent Constantine, whose worth, both as a Christian and as the leader of the Roman Empire, Julian severely questions.\n\nOne of the most important of his lost works is his \"Against the Galileans\", intended to refute the Christian religion. The only parts of this work which survive are those excerpted by Cyril of Alexandria, who gives extracts from the three first books in his refutation of Julian, \"Contra Julianum\". These extracts do not give an adequate idea of the work: Cyril confesses that he had not ventured to copy several of the weightiest arguments.\n\nJulian's works have been edited and translated several times since the Renaissance, most often separately; but many are translated in the Loeb Classical Library edition of 1913, edited by Wilmer Cave Wright. Wright mentions however that here are many problems surrounding Julian's vast collection of works, mainly the letters ascribed to Julian. The collections of letters we have today are the result of many smaller collections which contained varying numbers of Julian's works in various combinations. For example, in Laurentianus 58.16 the largest collection of letters ascribed to Julian was found, containing 43 manuscripts. it is unclear what the origins of many letters in these collections are. \n\nThe problems surrounding Julian's collection of works are exacerbated by the fact that Julian was a very motivated writer, which means it is possible that many more letters could have circulated, despite his short reign. Julian himself attests to the large amount of letters he had to write in one of the letters which is likely to be genuine. Julian’s religious agenda gave him even more work than the average emperor as he sought to instruct his newly-styled pagan priests and he had to deal with discontent Christian leaders and communities. An example of him instructing his pagan priests is visible in a fragment in the Vossianus MS., inserted in the Letter to Themistius. \n\nAdditionally, Julian's hostility towards the Christian faith inspired vicious counteractions by Christian authors as can be seen in Gregory of Nazianzus' invectives against Julian. Christians no doubt suppressed some of Julian's works as well if they believed them to be harmful to their faith. This Christian influence is still visible in Wright's much smaller collection of Julian's letters. She comments on how some letters are suddenly cut off when the contents become hostile towards Christians, believing them to be the result of Christian censoring. Notable examples of this are in the \"Fragment of a letter to a Priest\" and the \"letter to High-Priest Theodorus.\"  \n\nBULLET::::- In 1681 Lord Russell, an outspoken opponent of King Charles II of England and his brother The Duke of York, got his chaplain to write a \"Life of Julian the Apostate\". This work made use of the Roman Emperor's life in order to address contemporary English political and theological debates – specifically, to reply to the conservative arguments of Dr Hickes's sermons, and defend the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases.\nBULLET::::- In 1847, the controversial German theologian David Friedrich Strauss published in Mannheim the pamphlet \"Der Romantiker auf dem Thron der Cäsaren\" (\"A Romantic on the Throne of the Caesars\"), in which Julian was satirised as \"an unworldly dreamer, a man who turned nostalgia for the ancients into a way of life and whose eyes were closed to the pressing needs of the present\". In fact, this was a veiled criticism of the contemporary King Frederick William IV of Prussia, known for his romantic dreams of restoring the supposed glories of feudal Medieval society.\nBULLET::::- Julian's life inspired the play \"Emperor and Galilean\" by Henrik Ibsen.\nBULLET::::- The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read an English translation of Julian's work in 1891\nBULLET::::- Julian's life and reign were the subject of the novel \"The Death of the Gods (Julian the Apostate)\" (1895) in the trilogy of historical novels entitled \"Christ and Antichrist\" (1895–1904) by the Russian Symbolist poet, novelist and literary theoretician Dmitrii S.

After his death he received the posthumous cognomen Cicero, after the Roman orator of the same name, but the elector's eloquence and interest in the arts is debatable.\n\nJohn Cicero was the eldest son of Elector Albert III Achilles of Brandenburg with his first wife Margaret of Baden. As his father then ruled as Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (from 1457 also as Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach), he was born at the Hohenzollern residence of Ansbach in Franconia, where he spent his childhood years until in 1466 he received the call to Brandenburg as presumed heir by his uncle Elector Frederick II. He joined him in the War of the Succession of Stettin with the Pomeranian dukes, until Frederick resigned in 1470 and was succeeded by John's father, who in 1473 appointed him regent of the Brandenburg lands. After the Pomeranian struggle he also had to deal with the inheritance conflict upon the 1476 death of the Piast duke Henry XI of Głogów, husband of his half-sister Barbara.\n\nOn 25 August 1476 in Berlin John married Margaret of Wettin, a daughter of Landgrave William III of Thuringia with Anne, Duchess of Luxembourg.

He decreed that the \"Stadtschloss\" in Berlin, erected at the behest of his uncle Frederick II, should serve as the permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors, the beginning of the city's history as a state capital. He also implemented an excise tax on beer in 1488, which sparked several disturbances, mainly in the towns of the Altmark region. \n\nIn 1490 John was able to purchase the former Lusatian territory around Zossen, acknowledged by the Bohemian king Vladislaus II, and maintained the succession claims of the Hohenzollern dynasty to the Pomeranian lands held by the House of Griffins. He died in 1499 from pleural effusion at Arneburg Castle and was succeeded by his eldest son Joachim I. John was the first of the Hohenzollern electors to be buried in Brandenburg, first at Lehnin Abbey, later transferred to Berlin Cathedral by order of his grandson Joachim II.\n"}

He served as administrator of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg from 1566 to 1598, then succeeded his father as Elector of Brandenburg in 1598. Joachim Frederick was succeeded at his death by his son John Sigismund.

He became the Duke of Prussia through his marriage to Duchess Anna, the eldest daughter of Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia who died without sons. Their marriage resulted in the creation of Brandenburg-Prussia.\n\nJohn Sigismund was born in Halle an der Saale to Joachim III Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg, and his first wife Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin. He succeeded his father as Margrave of Brandenburg in 1608. In 1611, John Sigismund traveled from Königsberg to Warsaw, where on 16 November 1611 he gave feudal homage to Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland (the Duchy of Prussia was a Polish fief at the time). He officially became Duke of Prussia in 1618, although he had served as regent on behalf of the mentally-disturbed Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, for several years prior. John Sigismund died in the following year.\n\nJohn Sigismund gave the Reichshof Castrop to his teacher and educator Carl Friedrich von Bordelius, whereas he received the territories of Cleves, Mark, and Ravensberg in the Treaty of Xanten in 1614.\n\nJohn Sigismund's most significant action was his conversion from Lutheranism to Calvinism, after he had earlier equalized the rights of Catholics and Protestants in the Duchy of Prussia under pressure from the King of Poland. He was probably won over to Calvinism during a visit to Heidelberg in 1606, but it was not until 1613 that he publicly took communion according to the Calvinist rite. The vast majority of his subjects in Brandenburg, including his wife Anna of Prussia, remained deeply Lutheran, however. After the Elector and his Calvinist court officials drew up plans for mass conversion of the population to the new faith in February 1614, as provided for by the rule of \"Cuius regio, eius religio\" within the Holy Roman Empire, there were serious protests, with his wife backing the Lutherans. Resistance was so strong that in 1615, John Sigismund backed down and relinquished all attempts at forcible conversion. Instead, he allowed his subjects to be either Lutheran or Calvinist according to the dictates of their own consciences. Henceforward, Brandenburg-Prussia would be a bi-confessional state.\n\nOn 30 October 1594, John Sigismund married Anna of Prussia, daughter of Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia (1553–1618).

{"id": "16307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16307", "title": "Jackson Pollock", "text": "Jackson Pollock\n\nPaul Jackson Pollock (; January 28, 1912 – August 11, 1956) was an American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement.\n\nHe was widely noticed for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface (‘drip technique’), enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called ‘action painting’, since he used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy and fluency of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled \"Number 17A\" was reported to have fetched US $200 million in a private purchase.\n\nA reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy. Pollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related single-car accident when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.\n\nPaul Jackson Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming, in 1912, the youngest of five sons. His parents, Stella May (née McClure) and LeRoy Pollock, were born and grew up in Tingley, Iowa, and were educated at Tingley High School. Pollock's mother is interred at Tingley Cemetery, Ringgold County, Iowa. His father had been born with the surname McCoy, but took the surname of his adoptive parents, neighbors who adopted him after his own parents had died within a year of each other. Stella and LeRoy Pollock were Presbyterian; they were of Irish and Scots-Irish descent, respectively. LeRoy Pollock was a farmer and later a land surveyor for the government, moving for different jobs. Stella, proud of her family's heritage as weavers, made and sold dresses as a teenager. In November 1912, Stella took her sons to San Diego; Jackson was just 10 months old and would never return to Cody. He subsequently grew up in Arizona and Chico, California.\n\nWhile living in the Vermont Square neighborhood of Los Angeles, he enrolled at Manual Arts High School, from which he was expelled. He had already been expelled in 1928 from another high school. During his early life, Pollock explored Native American culture while on surveying trips with his father.\n\nIn 1930, following his older brother Charles Pollock, he moved to New York City, where they both studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League. Benton's rural American subject matter had little influence on Pollock's work, but his rhythmic use of paint and his fierce independence were more lasting. In the early 1930s, Pollock spent a summer touring the Western United States together with Glen Rounds, a fellow art student, and Benton, their teacher.\n\nPollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop in New York City by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s, such as \"Male and Female\" and \"Composition with Pouring I.\" After his move to Springs, he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor and he developed what was later called his \"drip\" technique.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1942 Pollock worked for the WPA Federal Art Project. During this time Pollock was trying to deal with his established alcoholism; from 1938 through 1941 he underwent Jungian psychotherapy with Dr. Joseph Henderson and later with Dr. Violet Staub de Laszlo in 1941–42. Henderson engaged him through his art, encouraging Pollock to make drawings. Jungian concepts and archetypes were expressed in his paintings. Some historians have hypothesized that Pollock might have had bipolar disorder.\nPollock signed a gallery contract with Peggy Guggenheim in July 1943. He received the commission to create the \"Mural\" (1943) for the entry to her new townhouse. At the suggestion of her friend and advisor Marcel Duchamp, Pollock painted the work on canvas, rather than the wall, so that it would be portable. After seeing the big mural, the art critic Clement Greenberg wrote: \"I took one look at it and I thought, 'Now that's great art,' and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced.\" The catalog introducing his first exhibition described Pollock's talent as \"volcanic. It has fire. It is unpredictable. It is undisciplined. It spills out of itself in a mineral prodigality, not yet crystallized.\"\n\nPollock's most famous paintings were made during the \"drip period\" between 1947 and 1950. He became famous following an August 8, 1949 four-page spread in \"Life\" magazine that asked, \"Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?\" At the peak of his fame, Pollock abruptly abandoned the drip style.\n\nPollock's work after 1951 was darker in color, including a collection painted in black on unprimed canvases. These paintings have been referred to as his 'Black pourings' and when he exhibited them at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York, none of them sold. Parsons later sold one to a friend at half the price. The departure from his earlier style wasn't what his collectors wanted. These works show Pollock attempting to find a balance between abstraction and depictions of the figure.\n\nHe later returned to using color and continued with figurative elements. During this period, Pollock had moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery, a more commercial gallery; the demand for his work from collectors was great. In response to this pressure, along with personal frustration, his alcoholism deepened.\n\nThe two artists met while they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery in 1942. Krasner was unfamiliar, yet intrigued with Pollock's work and went to his apartment, unannounced, to meet him following the gallery. In October 1945, Pollock and Lee Krasner were married in a church with two witnesses present for the event. In November, they moved out of the city to the Springs area of East Hampton on the south shore of Long Island. With the help of a downpayment loan from Peggy Guggenheim, they bought a wood-frame house and barn at 830 Springs Fireplace Road. Pollock converted the barn into a studio. In that space, he perfected his big \"drip\" technique of working with paint, with which he would become permanently identified. When the couple found themselves free from work they enjoyed spending their time together cooking and baking, working on the house and garden, and entertaining friends.\nKrasner's influence on her husband's art was something critics began to reassess by the later half of the 1960s due to the rise of feminism at the time. Krasner's extensive knowledge and training in modern art and techniques helped her bring Pollock up to date with what contemporary art should be. Krasner is often considered to have taught her husband in the dominant tenets of modernistic painting. Pollock was then able to change his style to fit a more organized and cosmopolitan genre of modern art, and Krasner became the one judge he could trust. At the beginning of the two artists' marriage, Pollock would trust his counterpart's opinions on what worked and what did not in his pieces. Krasner was also responsible for introducing him to many collectors, critics, and artists, including Herbert Matter, who would help further his career as an emerging artist. John Bernard Myers, a noted art dealer, was once quoted as saying, \"there would never have been a Jackson Pollock without a Lee Pollock\", whereas fellow painter Fritz Bultman referred to Pollock as Krasner's \"creation, her Frankenstein\", both men recognizing the immense impact Krasner had on Pollock's career.\n\nJackson Pollock's influence on his wife's artwork is often discussed by art historians. Many people thought that Krasner began to reproduce and reinterpret her husband's chaotic paint splatters in her own work. There are several accounts where Krasner intended to use her own intuition, as a way to move towards Pollock's \"I am nature\" technique in order to reproduce nature in her art. Krasner's largest challenge as an artist was to establish a separation between herself and her husband that was not strictly the otherness of a woman.\n\nIn 1955, Pollock painted \"Scent\" and \"Search,\" his last two paintings. He did not paint at all in 1956, but was making sculptures at Tony Smith's home: constructions of wire, gauze, and plaster. Shaped by sand-casting, they have heavily textured surfaces similar to what Pollock often created in his paintings.\n\nPollock and Krasner's relationship began to crumble by 1956, owing to Pollock's continuing alcoholism and infidelity involving Ruth Kligman. On August 11, 1956, at 10:15 pm, Pollock died in a single-car crash in his Oldsmobile convertible while driving under the influence of alcohol. At the time Krasner was visiting friends in Europe and she abruptly returned on hearing the news from a friend. One of the passengers, Edith Metzger, was also killed in the accident, which occurred less than a mile from Pollock's home. The other passenger, Ruth Kligman, an artist and Pollock's mistress, survived. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.\n\nFor the rest of her life, his widow Lee Krasner managed his estate and ensured that Pollock's reputation remained strong despite changing art world trends. The couple are buried in Green River Cemetery in Springs with a large boulder marking his grave and a smaller one marking hers.\n\nThe work of Thomas Hart Benton, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró influenced Pollock.\nPollock started using synthetic resin-based paints called alkyd enamels, which at that time was a novel medium. Pollock described this use of household paints, instead of artist's paints, as \"a natural growth out of a need\". He used hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators. Pollock's technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term action painting. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.\n\nOne definitive influence on Pollock was the work of the Ukrainian American artist Janet Sobel (1894–1968) (born Jennie Lechovsky). Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel's work in her \"The Art of This Century Gallery\" in 1945. Jackson Pollock and art critic Clement Greenberg saw Sobel's work there in 1946 and later Greenberg noted that Sobel was \"a direct influence on Jackson Pollock's drip painting technique.\" In his essay \"American-Type Painting,\" Greenberg noted those works were the first of all-over painting he had seen, and said, \"Pollock admitted that these pictures had made an impression on him\".\n\nWhile painting this way, Pollock moved away from figurative representation, and challenged the Western tradition of using easel and brush. He used the force of his whole body to paint, which was expressed on the large canvases. In 1956, \"Time\" magazine dubbed Pollock \"Jack the Dripper\" due to his painting style.\n\nPollock observed American Indian sandpainting demonstrations in the 1940s. Referring to his style of painting on the floor, Pollock stated, \"I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.\" Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on \"the accident\"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular work to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see.\n\nAustrian artist Wolfgang Paalen's article on totem art of the indigenous people of British Columbia, in which the concept of space in totemist art is considered from an artist's point of view, influenced Pollock as well; Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943). He had also seen Paalen's surrealist paintings in an exhibition of in 1940. Another strong influence must have been Paalen's surrealist \"fumage\" technique, which appealed to painters looking for new ways to depict what was called the \"unseen\" or the \"possible\". The technique was once demonstrated in Matta's workshop, about which Steven Naifeh reports, \"Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [Paalen's] Fumage, Jackson [Pollock] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: 'I can do that without the smoke.'\" Pollock's painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated, \"It was Wolfgang Paalen who started it all.\"\n\nIn 1950, Hans Namuth, a young photographer, wanted to take pictures (both stills and moving) of Pollock at work. Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session, but when Namuth arrived, Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished.\n\nNamuth said that when he entered the studio:\n\nContinuing to evade the viewer's search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works. He said about this, \"[L]ook passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for.\" His wife said, \"He used to give his pictures conventional titles ... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral. They make people look at a picture for what it is—pure painting.\"\n\nPollock's work has been the subject of important critical debates. The critic Robert Coates once derided a number of Pollock's works as \"mere unorganized explosions of random energy, and therefore meaningless.\"\n\nJean Helion the French abstract painter, on the other hand, on first seeing a \"Pollock,\" remarked, \"It filled out space going on and on because it did not have a start or end to it.\"\n\nIn a famous 1952 article in \"ARTnews\", Harold Rosenberg coined the term \"action painting\" and wrote that \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint.' The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral.\" Many people assumed that he had modeled his \"action painter\" paradigm on Pollock.\n\nClement Greenberg supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds. It fit well with Greenberg's view of art history as a progressive purification in form and elimination of historical content. He considered Pollock's work to be the best painting of its day and the culmination of the Western tradition via Cubism and Cézanne to Manet.\n\n\"Reynold's News\", in a 1959 headline, said, \"This is not art—it's a joke in bad taste.\"\nThe Congress for Cultural Freedom, an organization to promote American culture and values, backed by the CIA, sponsored exhibitions of Pollock's work. Certain left-wing scholars, most prominently Eva Cockcroft, have argued that the U.S. government and wealthy elite embraced Pollock and abstract expressionism to place the United States in the forefront of global art and devalue socialist realism. Cockcroft wrote that Pollock became a \"weapon of the Cold War\".\n\nPollock himself described his art as \"motion made visible memories, arrested in space.\"\n\nPollock's staining into raw canvas was adapted by the Color Field painters Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis. Frank Stella made \"all-over composition\" a hallmark of his works of the 1960s. The Happenings artist Allan Kaprow, sculptors Richard Serra and Eva Hesse, and many contemporary artists have retained Pollock's emphasis on the process of creation; they were influenced by his approach to process, rather than the look of his work.\n\nIn 2004, \"One: Number 31, 1950\" was ranked the eighth-most influential piece of modern art in a poll of 500 artists, curators, critics, and dealers.\n\nIn 1960, Ornette Coleman's album \"\" featured a Pollock painting, \"The White Light\", as its cover artwork.\n\nThe British indie band The Stone Roses were heavily influenced by Pollock; they have cover artwork made of pastiches of his work, starting in 1989 with the album \"The Stone Roses\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, three groups of movie makers were developing Pollock biographical projects, each based on a different source. The project that at first seemed most advanced was a joint venture between Barbra Streisand's Barwood Films and Robert De Niro's TriBeCa Productions (De Niro's parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock). The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on Jeffrey Potter's 1985 oral biography, \"To a Violent Grave,\" a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends. Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock. A second was to be based on \"Love Affair\" (1974), a memoir by Ruth Kligman, who was Pollock's lover in the six months before his death. This was to be directed by Harold Becker, with Al Pacino playing Pollock.\n\nIn 2000, the biographical film \"Pollock\", based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, \"\", directed by and starring Ed Harris, was released. Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner. The movie was the project of Ed Harris, who portrayed Pollock. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Harris himself painted the works seen in the film. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation did not authorize or collaborate with any production.\n\nIn September 2009, the art historian Henry Adams claimed in \"Smithsonian\" magazine that Pollock had written his name in his famous painting \"Mural\" (1943). The painting is now insured for US$140 million. In 2011, the Republican Iowa State Representative Scott Raecker introduced a bill to force the sale of the artwork, held by the University of Iowa, to fund scholarships, but his bill created such controversy that it was quickly withdrawn.\n\nPollock is mentioned many times throughout the 2009 play \"Red\", by John Logan. The play's main character, Mark Rothko, was a fellow abstract expressionist of his era. In the play, Rothko speaks to his assistant, Ken, about Pollock's works and his death.\n\nA fictional Pollock painting is shown throughout the 2016 movie \"The Accountant\", by Bill Dubuque. The movie's main character, played by Ben Affleck, gains the painting through his career. He gifts it to the character played by Anna Kendrick at the end of the film.\n\nIn 1973, \"Number 11, 1952\" (also known as \"Blue Poles\") was purchased by the Australian Whitlam government for the National Gallery of Australia for US$2 million (A$1.3 million at the time of payment). At the time, this was the highest price ever paid for a modern painting. The painting is now one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery. It was a centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art's 1998 retrospective in New York, the first time the painting had been shown in America since its purchase.\n\nIn November 2006, Pollock's \"No. 5, 1948\" became the world's most expensive painting, when it was sold privately to an undisclosed buyer for the sum of US$140 million. Another artist record was established in 2004, when \"No. 12\" (1949), a medium-sized drip painting that had been shown in the United States Pavilion at the 1950 Venice Biennale, fetched US$11.7 million at Christie's, New York. In 2012, \"Number 28, 1951,\" one of the artist's combinations of drip and brushwork in shades of silvery gray with red, yellow, and shots of blue and white, also sold at Christie's, New York, for US$20.5 million— US$23 million with fees—within its estimated range of US$20 million to US$30 million.\n\nIn 2013, Pollock's \"Number 19\" (1948) was sold by Christie's for a reported US$58,363,750 during an auction that ultimately reached US$495 million total sales in one night which Christie's reports as a record to date as the most expensive auction of contemporary art.\n\nIn February 2016, Bloomberg News reported that Kenneth C. Griffin had purchased Jackson Pollock's 1948 painting \"Number 17A\" for US$200 million, from David Geffen.\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner Authentication Board was created by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in 1990 to evaluate newly found works for an upcoming supplement to the 1978 catalogue. In the past, however, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has declined to be involved in authentication cases.\n\nIn 2006, a documentary, \"Who the *$&% Is Jackson Pollock?\" was made concerning Teri Horton, a truck driver who in 1992 bought an abstract painting for five dollars at a thrift store in California. This work may be a lost Pollock painting, but its authenticity is debated.\n\n\"Untitled 1950\", which the New York-based Knoedler Gallery had sold in 2007 for US$17 million to Pierre Lagrange, a London hedge-fund multimillionaire, was subject to an authenticity suit before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Done in the painter's classic drip-and-splash style and signed \"J. Pollock\", the modest-sized painting (15 by 28 1/2 in) was found to contain yellow paint pigments not commercially available until about 1970. The suit was settled in a confidential agreement in 2012.\n\nIn 1999, physicist-artist Richard Taylor used computer analysis to show similarities between Pollock's painted patterns and fractals (patterns that recur on multiple size scales) found in natural scenery, reflecting Pollock's own words \"I am Nature\". His research team labelled Pollock's style Fractal Expressionism.\n\nIn 2003, 24 Pollockesque paintings and drawings were found in a locker in Wainscott, New York. In 2005, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute stirring controversy by researchers at the University of Oregon, which identified differences between the patterns in the 6 disputed paintings analyzed and those in 14 established Pollocks. Pigment analysis of the paintings by researchers at Harvard University showed the presence in one painting of a synthetic pigment that was not patented until the 1980s, and materials in two others that were not available in Pollock's lifetime.\n\nIn 2007, a traveling museum exhibition of the paintings was mounted and was accompanied by a comprehensive book, \"Pollock Matters\", written by Ellen G. Landau, one of the four sitting scholars from the former Pollock Krasner Foundation authentication panel from the 1990s, and Claude Cernuschi, a scholar in Abstract Expressionism. In the book, Ellen Landau demonstrates the many connections between the family who owns the paintings and Jackson Pollock during his lifetime to place the paintings in what she believes to be their proper historic context. Landau also presents the forensic findings of Harvard University and presents possible explanations for the forensic inconsistencies that were found in three of the 24 paintings. However, the scientist who invented one of the modern pigments dismissed the possibility that Pollock used this paint as being \"unlikely to the point of fantasy.\"\n\nSubsequently, over 10 scientific groups have performed fractal analysis on over 50 of Pollock's works. A recent study which used fractal analysis as one of its techniques achieved a 93% success rate distinguishing real from fake Pollocks. Current research of Fractal Expressionism focuses on human response to viewing fractals. Cognitive neuroscientists have shown that Pollock's fractals induce the same stress-reduction in observers as computer-generated fractals and Nature's fractals.\n\nLee Krasner donated Pollock's papers in 1983 to the Archives of American Art. They were later archived with her own papers. The Archives of American Art also houses the Charles Pollock papers, which include correspondence, photographs, and other files relating to his brother Jackson.\n\nA separate organization, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, was established in 1985. The foundation functions as the official estate for both Pollock and his widow, but also under the terms of Krasner's will, serves \"to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need\". The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.\n\nThe Pollock-Krasner House and Studio is owned and administered by the Stony Brook Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of Stony Brook University. Regular tours of the house and studio occur from May through October.\n\nBULLET::::- (1942) \"Male and Female\" Philadelphia Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- (1942) \"Stenographic Figure\" Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1942) \"The Moon Woman\" Peggy Guggenheim Collection\nBULLET::::- (1943) \"Mural\" University of Iowa Museum of Art, given by Peggy Guggenheim\nBULLET::::- (1943) \"The She-Wolf\" Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1943) \"Blue (Moby Dick)\" Ohara Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- (1945) \"Night Mist\" Norton Gallery of Art\nBULLET::::- (1945) \"Troubled Queen\" Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nBULLET::::- (1946) \"Eyes in the Heat\" Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice\nBULLET::::- (1946) \"The Key\" Art Institute of Chicago\nBULLET::::- (1946) \"The Tea Cup\" Collection Frieder Burda\nBULLET::::- (1946) \"Shimmering Substance\", from \"The Sounds In The Grass\" Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1947) \"Portrait of H.M.\" University of Iowa Museum of Art, given by Peggy Guggenheim.\nBULLET::::- (1947) \"Full Fathom Five\" Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1947) \"Cathedral\" Dallas Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- (1947) \"Enchanted Forest\" Peggy Guggenheim Collection\nBULLET::::- (1947) \"Lucifer\" The Anderson Collection at Stanford University\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Painting\"\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Number 5\" (4 ft x 8 ft) Private collection\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Number 8\"- Neuburger Museum at the State University of New York at Purchase.\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Number 13A: Arabesque\"- At Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Composition (White, Black, Blue and Red on White)\" New Orleans Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Summertime: Number 9A\" Tate Modern\nBULLET::::- (1948) \"Number 19\"\nBULLET::::- (1949) \"Number 1\" Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\nBULLET::::- (1949) \"Number 3\" Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC\nBULLET::::- (1949) \"Number 10\" Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\nBULLET::::- (1949) \"Number 11\" Indiana University Art Museum Bloomington, Indiana\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist)\" National Gallery of Art\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"Mural on Indian red ground, 1950\" Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"Autumn Rhythm (Number 30), 1950\" Metropolitan Museum of Art\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"Number 29, 1950\" National Gallery of Canada\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"Number 32\", Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf, BRD\nBULLET::::- (1950) \"\" Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1951) \"Number 7\" National Gallery of Art\nBULLET::::- (1951) \"Black and White (Number 6)\" San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\nBULLET::::- (1952) \"Convergence\" Albright-Knox Art Gallery\nBULLET::::- (1952) \"Blue Poles: No. 11, 1952\" National Gallery of Australia\nBULLET::::- (1952) \"Number 12, 1952\" Governor Nelson A.

{"id": "16308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16308", "title": "Jet Li", "text": "Jet Li\n\nLi Lianjie (courtesy name Yangzhong; born 26 April 1963), better known by his stage name Jet Li, is a Chinese film actor, film producer, martial artist, and retired Wushu champion who was born in Beijing. He is a naturalized Singaporean citizen.\n\nAfter three years of training with acclaimed Wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team. After retiring from competitive Wushu at age 19, he went on to win great acclaim in China as an actor, making his debut with the film \"Shaolin Temple\" (1982). He went on to star in many critically acclaimed martial arts epic films, most notably as the lead in Zhang Yimou's \"Hero\" (2002), \"Fist of Legend\" (1994), and the first three films in the \"Once Upon a Time in China\" series (1991–1993), in which he portrayed folk hero Wong Fei-hung.\n\nLi's first role in a non-Chinese film was as a villain in \"Lethal Weapon 4\" (1998), and his first leading role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in \"Romeo Must Die\" (2000). He has gone on to star in many international action films, including in French cinema with the Luc Besson-produced films \"Kiss of the Dragon\" (2001) and \"Unleashed\" (2005). He co-starred in \"The One\" (2001) and \"War\" (2007) with Jason Statham, \"The Forbidden Kingdom\" (2008) with Jackie Chan, all three of \"The Expendables\" films with Sylvester Stallone, and as the title character villain in \"\" (2008).\n\nLi was born in Beijing, China and was the youngest of two boys and two girls. When he was two years old, his father died and his family then lived in poverty.\n\nLi was eight when his talent for Wushu was noticed as he practiced at a school summer course. He then attended a non-sparring wushu event, followed by joining the Beijing Wushu Team which did a martial art display at the All China Games. Renowned coaches Li Junfeng and Wu Bin, made extra efforts to help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li's family because they could not afford to buy meat, which was essential for an athletes physical condition. A very young Li competed against adults, in the Chinese Wushu Championships and won fifteen gold medals and one silver medal.\n\nAccording to Li, once, as a child, when the Chinese National Wushu Team went to perform for President Richard Nixon in the United States, he was asked by Nixon to be his personal bodyguard. Li replied, \"I don't want to protect any individual. When I grow up, I want to defend my one billion Chinese countrymen!\"\n\nLi is a master of several styles of wushu, especially Chángquán (Northern Longfist Style) and Fānziquán (Tumbling fist). He has also studied other arts including Baguazhang (Eight trigram palm), Taijiquan (Supreme ultimate fist), Xing Yi Quan (Shape intent fist), Zui Quan (Drunken fist), Ying Zhao Quan (Eagle claw fist) and Tanglangquan (Praying mantis fist). He did not learn Nanquan (Southern fist), because his training focused only in the Northern Shaolin Styles. He has also mastered wushu's main weapons, such as Sanjiegun (Three Section Staff), Gùn, Dao (Broadsword), Jian (Straight Sword). Jet Li's martial arts prowess contributed to his domestic and international fame.\n\nThe fame gained by his sports winnings led to a career as a martial arts film star, beginning in mainland China and then continuing into Hong Kong. Li acquired his screen name in 1982 in the Philippines when a publicity company thought his real name was too hard to pronounce. They likened his career to an aircraft, which likewise \"takes-off\" as quickly, so they placed the name Jet Li on the movie posters. Soon everybody was calling him by this new name, which was also based on the nickname, \"Jet,\" given to him as a young student, due to his speed and grace when training with the Beijing Wushu team. He made his debut with the 1982 film \"Shaolin Temple\". Some of his more famous Chinese films include:\nBULLET::::- The \"Shaolin Temple\" series (1, 2 and 3), which are considered to be the films which sparked the rebirth of the real Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng, China;\nBULLET::::- The \"Once Upon a Time in China\" series (Chinese title: \"Wong Fei Hung\"), about the legendary Chinese folk hero Master Wong Fei Hung.\nBULLET::::- \"Fist of Legend\" (Chinese title: \"Jing Wu Ying Xiong\"), a remake of Bruce Lee's \"Fist of Fury.\"\nBULLET::::- The \"Fong Sai Yuk\" films about another Chinese folk hero.\n\nLi starred in the 1995 film \"High Risk\", where Jet Li plays a Captain who becomes disillusioned after his wife is murdered by crime lords. Along the way, he pairs up with a wacky sell-out actor, Frankie (played by Jacky Cheung), and proceeds to engage in a series of violent battles in a high-rise building. The setting is similar to that of \"Die Hard\" and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director Wong Jing had such a terrible experience working with Jackie Chan in Jing's previous film \"City Hunter\" that he chose to make Cheung's character a biting satire of Chan. Jet Li would later publicly apologise to Chan for taking part in it.\n\nLi had two wuxia feature films released in 2011, \"The Sorcerer and the White Snake\" and \"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate\"; the latter was helmed by Tsui Hark.\n\nTo promote tai chi, in 2012 Jet Li starred in a film titled \"Tai Chi\" and co-produced the movie with Chen Kuo-Fu. Li portrayed Tai Chi master Yang Luchan.\n\nIn 1998, he made his American film debut in \"Lethal Weapon 4\" which also marked the first time he had ever played a villain in a film. He agreed to do \"Lethal Weapon 4\" after the producer Joel Silver promised to give him the leading role in his next film, \"Romeo Must Die\" (2000), alongside late singer Aaliyah. The film became a box office hit. Though Li spoke very little English at the time of production, his performance as Chinese mafia hitman Wah Sing Ku was praised.\n\nLi turned down Chow Yun-fat's role in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) because he promised his wife that he would not make any films during her pregnancy. He also turned down the role of Seraph in \"The Matrix\" trilogy, based on his belief that the role was not one which required his skills and that the films were iconic and stunning enough without adding his name to the cast list. Li was also cast as Kato in \"The Green Hornet\" when the film was still in development in 2000. In 2001, it was moved to another studio. When the film was moved on again and released in 2011, the role of Kato was portrayed by Jay Chou.\n\nIn 2001, he appeared in two more films: \"The One\", which was the first of his films with Jason Statham, and \"Kiss of the Dragon\" opposite Bridget Fonda which did moderately well at the box office. In July 2001, Li agreed to produce and star in an action film with Jackie Chan which was to be released in 2002 or 2003, but no further news of their collaboration surfaced until 2006. In 2002, the period martial arts epic film \"Hero\" was released in the Chinese market. This film was both a commercial and critical success and became the highest-grossing motion picture in Chinese film history at the time. In 2003 he reunited with producer Joel Silver for the action thriller film \"Cradle 2 the Grave\" where he starred alongside rapper DMX and fellow martial artist Mark Dacascos. In 2004, Li lent his likeness, voice and provided motion capture work for the video game \"\".\n\nLi was presented the Visionary Award by East West Players, the oldest Asian American theatre in the United States, in 2002 by contemporary John Woo. The award recognizes \"artists who have raised the visibility of the Asian Pacific American community through theater, film and television.\" He delivered his acceptance speech in his native language of Mandarin.\n\nLi took on a more serious role in the 2005 film, \"Unleashed\" (a.k.a. \"Danny the Dog\"), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality of a child who has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were used extensively, it was a somber film with more depth than had been previously seen in Li's films, and co-starred dramatic actors Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman.\n\nIn 2006, the martial arts film epic \"Fearless\", was released worldwide. Although he will continue to make martial arts films, \"Fearless\" is his last wushu epic. In \"Fearless\", he played Huo Yuanjia, the real-life founder of Chin Woo Athletic Association, who reportedly defeated foreign boxers and Japanese martial artists in publicised events at a time when China's power was seen as eroding. Together with the film \"Fist of Legend\", Li has portrayed both Chen Jun, the student and avenger of Huo Yuanjia (a.k.a. Fok Yun Gap), as well as Huo Yuanjia himself. \"Fearless\" was released on 26 January 2006 in Hong Kong, followed by a 22 September 2006 release in the United States where it reached second place in its first weekend.\n\nLi has stated in an interview with the \"Shenzhen Daily\" newspaper that this will be his last martial arts epic, which is also stated in the film's television promotions. However, he plans to continue his film career in other genres. Specifically, he plans to continue acting in epic action and martial arts films dealing more with religious and philosophical issues.\n\nLi's 2007 Hollywood film, \"War\", was released in August of that year, and re-teamed him with actor Jason Statham, who previously starred with him in \"The One\", and action choreographer Corey Yuen. \"War\" raked in a disappointing at the box office, becoming one of Li's lowest grossers in America; however, it was a hit on video, accumulating nearly in rental revenue, more than doubling its box office take. With the exception of \"Romeo Must Die\" and the worldwide release of \"Hero\", most of Li's American/Western films have been only modest hits like \"Kiss of the Dragon\", \"The One\", \"Unleashed\", \"Cradle 2 the Grave\", and the worldwide release of \"Fearless\".\n\nIn late 2007, Li returned again to China to participate in the China/Hong Kong co-production of the period war film \"The Warlords\" with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. This film, with its focus on dramatics rather than martial arts, netted Li the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor.\n\nLi and fellow martial arts veteran Jackie Chan finally appeared together onscreen for the first time in \"The Forbidden Kingdom\", which began filming in May 2007 and was released to critical and commercial success on 18 April 2008. The film was based on the legend of the Monkey King from the Chinese folk novel \"Journey to the West\". Li also starred as the lead villain in the fantasy action film \"\" with actors Brendan Fraser, Isabella Leong and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nAfter a one-year hiatus from filmmaking, Jet Li returned to acting in 2010, portraying a mercenary in the film \"The Expendables\", teaming up with action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture. It was the third time he had teamed up with Statham. In 2012, he reprised his role briefly in the sequel \"The Expendables 2\" and returned for the third film \"The Expendables 3\" in 2014. Li was initially stated to be appearing with Vin Diesel in \"\", but according to a Facebook post by Diesel, Li was replaced by Donnie Yen.\n\nLi was cast as the Emperor of China for the 2020 live action movie, \"Mulan\".\n\nLi is a practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism. His master is Lho Kunsang.\n\nIn 1987, Li married Beijing Wushu Team member and \"Kids from Shaolin\" co-star Huang Qiuyan, with whom he has two daughters, Si and Taimi. They divorced in 1990. In 1999, Li married Nina Li Chi (born Li Zhi), a Shanghai-born, Hong Kong-based actress. He has two daughters with her, Jane (born 2000) and Jada (born 2002).\n\nHe was in the Maldives when a tsunami hit during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Although it was widely reported at the time that he had died during the disaster, he only suffered a minor foot injury, caused by a piece of floating furniture while he was guiding his 4-year-old daughter Jane and the nanny holding his 1-year-old daughter Jada to safety of higher ground amid dangerously rising ocean water. The four of them were by the pool and slightly above the beach when the wave came ashore, barely escaping to the upper floors of a hotel building.\n\nIn 2009, Li, who previously had US citizenship after years working in the United States, renounced his US citizenship. He was thought to have taken up Singaporean citizenship, although Singaporean authorities did not initially provide any confirmation of this. On 28 July 2009, the chairman of One Foundation (the charity fund of Li) announced that Jet Li had indeed become a Singaporean citizen. He was said to have chosen Singapore for its education system for his two younger daughters.\n\nIn 2009, he launched his own fitness program, Wuji. The programme consists of elements of martial arts, yoga and pilates; Adidas launched a special clothing line for it that bears the initials of \"JL\".\n\nIn 2013, Li revealed that he suffers from hyperthyroidism and has been dealing with the issue for the past three years. Since his heart rate can hit 130~140 at rest, Li takes medication to control his heart rate and has been advised not to do any sort of exercise. In 2016, he stated that he had recovered from his illness and that accepting fewer film offers was due to his charity work and not because of his health conditions.\n\nIn his free time he likes to play badminton and table tennis, ride his bicycle, read and meditate. He collects rare Tibetan beads. He says he is never bored in his free time.\n\nLi, as a Buddhist, believes that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome with the help of religious philosophies. He thinks that fame is not something he can control; therefore, he does not care about it.\n\nAccording to Li, everything he has ever wanted to tell the world can be found in three of his films: the message of \"Hero\" is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; \"Unleashed\" shows that violence is never a solution; and \"Fearless\" tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.\n\nAbout Wushu, he said that he believes the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony, and considers it a sad development that today's Wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist. He believes Wushu now lacks individuality and competitors move like machines, whereas according to his views Wushu should not be considered a race where the fastest athlete wins. He would like to see Wushu as a form of art, where artists have a distinctive style. Li blames the new competition rules that, according to him, place limitations on martial artists.\n\nLi believes that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense and instead of trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: \"A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case.\" He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real-life fight and he does not wish to, either.\n\nLi has been a \"philanthropic ambassador\" of the Red Cross Society of China since January 2006. He contributed 500,000 yuan () of box office revenues from his film \"Fearless\" to the Red Cross' psychological sunshine project, which promotes mental health.\n\nIn April 2007, touched by his life-shaking experience in the Maldives when he was close to dying during the 2004 tsunami, Li formed his own non-profit foundation called The One Foundation. The One Foundation supports international disaster relief efforts in conjunction with the Red Cross as well as other efforts, including mental health awareness and suicide prevention. Since the starting of the foundation, Li has been involved with recovery efforts in seven disasters, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan. In the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Ya'an, Sichuan, Li and other members of the entertainment sector were the first to appeal for donations of money, goods and materials to help the victims of the disaster. Wu Jing was a One Foundation volunteer and helped in the effort.\n\nLi discussed his commitment to philanthropy in an interview with the December 2009 issue of \"Alliance\" magazine, stating that \"grassroots non-government organizations can help the government in its blind spots. Government relief is not always detail-oriented. Grassroots NGOs can't be as big as a government effort, but they need to be flexible and independent.\"\n\nIn September 2010, he was appointed by the International Red Cross as the first Good Will Ambassador. He posted online, saying: \"Today I signed a deal with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – IFRC – to become the FIRST goodwill ambassador in the history of this humanitarian organization. I am very honored! At the same time, I will not pause to celebrate, but instead keep pushing forward and do my best to help the world! Thank you all once again for your support and belief in me!\"\n\nIt was also announced in September 2010, when Li was attending his wax unveiling ceremony in Hong Kong Madame Tussauds, that Li would be meeting Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to talk about charity work. \"Three days ago, I received an email from Gates, hoping I could make time because he and Buffett hoped I could go for a 30-minute chat before the dinner about the future we face as human beings, so I will go,\" Li said.\n\nHe founded Taiji Zen in 2011, along with co-founder Executive chairman Jack Ma. Taiji Zen is a lifestyle company with the mission of spreading \"Health and Happiness for All\" through a balance of physical wellness and mental fitness. Taiji Zen combined the martial art of Taijiquan (a.k.a. T'ai Chi Chuan) with mindfulness-based practices such as meditation. It packaged these art forms into several different classes and online programs.\n\nBy US box office statistics, the most successful Jet Li film as of August 2010 is \"Lethal Weapon 4\", which grossed over $130 million domestically, while the second is \"The Expendables\" with over $103 million. \"Hero\" is the third most successful foreign language film in the US, and one of the most critically acclaimed Li movies. \"Fearless\" is the seventh most successful foreign language film of all time in the US. From an aggregated critical point of view, the best acclaimed Li movie is \"Fist of Legend\" (Rotten Tomatoes: 100%) and the worst is \"War\" (Rotten Tomatoes: 12%).\n\n! Year\n! Award\n! Category\n!

Amigoni initially painted both mythological and religious scenes; but as the panoply of his patrons expanded northward, he began producing many parlour works depicting gods in sensuous languor or games. His style influenced Giuseppe Nogari. Among his pupils were Charles Joseph Flipart, Michelangelo Morlaiter, Pietro Antonio Novelli, Joseph Wagner, and Antonio Zucchi.\n\nStarting in 1717, he is documented as working in Bavaria in the Castle of Nymphenburg (1719); in the castle of Schleissheim (1725–1729); and in the Benedictine abbey of Ottobeuren. He returned to Venice in 1726. His \"Arraignment of Paris\" hangs in the Villa Pisani at Stra. From 1730 to 1739 he worked in England, in Pown House, Moor Park Wolterton Hall and in the theatre of Covent Garden. From there, he helped convince Canaletto to travel to England by telling him of the ample patronage available. \n\nIn London or during a trip to Paris in 1736, he met the celebrated castrato Farinelli, whose portrait he painted twice in 1735 and again in 1752. Amigoni also encountered the painting of François Lemoyne and François Boucher. \n\nIn 1739 he returned to Italy, perhaps to Naples and surely to Montecassino, in whose Abbey existed two canvases (destroyed during World War II). He travelled to Venice to paint for Sigismund Streit, for the Casa Savoia and other buildings of the city. \n\nIn 1747 he left Italy for Madrid, encouraged by Farinelli, who held a court appointment there. He became court painter to Ferdinand VI of Spain and director of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando. He painted a group portrait that included himself, Farinelli, Metastasio, Teresa Castellini, and an unidentified young man. The young man may have been the Austrian Archduke Joseph, the Habsburg heir to the throne. Amigoni died in Madrid.\n\nAmigoni was the father of the pastellist Caterina Amigoni Castellini, and the sister of the artist Carlotta Amigoni.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Consul Marcus Curius Dentatus prefers turnips to the Samnites' gifts\"\nBULLET::::- \"Caroline Wilhelmina of Brandenburg-Ansbach\"\nBULLET::::- Print after Amigoni of \"Princess Amelia Sophia Eleanora\"\nBULLET::::- Prints after portraits by Amigoni.\nBULLET::::- \"Venus disarming cupid\".\nBULLET::::- \"Venus and Adonis\"\n"}
{"id": "16312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16312", "title": "Jean-François Millet", "text": "Jean-François Millet\n\nJean-François Millet (; October 4, 1814 – January 20, 1875) was a French painter and one of the founders of the Barbizon school in rural France. Millet is noted for his scenes of peasant farmers; he can be categorized as part of the Realism art movement.\n\nMillet was the first child of Jean-Louis-Nicolas and Aimée-Henriette-Adélaïde Henry Millet, members of the farming community in the village of Gruchy, in Gréville-Hague (Normandy), close to the coast. Under the guidance of two village priests—one of them was vicar Jean Lebrisseux—Millet acquired a knowledge of Latin and modern authors. But soon he had to help his father with the farm-work; because Millet was the eldest of the sons. So all the farmer's work was familiar to him: to mow, make hay, bind the sheaves, thresh, winnow, spread manure, plow, sow, etc. All these motifs would return in his later art. This stopped when he was 18 and sent by his father to Cherbourg in 1833, to study with a portrait painter named Paul Dumouchel. By 1835 he was studying full-time with Lucien-Théophile Langlois, a pupil of Baron Gros, in Cherbourg. A stipend provided by Langlois and others enabled Millet to move to Paris in 1837, where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts with Paul Delaroche. In 1839 his scholarship was terminated, and his first submission to the Salon was rejected.\n\nAfter his first painting, a portrait, was accepted at the Salon of 1840, Millet returned to Cherbourg to begin a career as a portrait painter. However, the following year he married Pauline-Virginie Ono, and they moved to Paris. After rejections at the Salon of 1843 and Pauline's death by consumption, Millet returned again to Cherbourg. In 1845 Millet moved to Le Havre with Catherine Lemaire, whom he would marry in a civil ceremony in 1853; they would have nine children and remain together for the rest of Millet's life. In Le Havre he painted portraits and small genre pieces for several months, before moving back to Paris.\n\nIt was in Paris in the middle 1840s that Millet befriended Constant Troyon, Narcisse Diaz, Charles Jacque, and Théodore Rousseau, artists who, like Millet, would become associated with the Barbizon school; Honoré Daumier, whose figure draftsmanship would influence Millet's subsequent rendering of peasant subjects; and Alfred Sensier, a government bureaucrat who would become a lifelong supporter and eventually the artist's biographer. In 1847 his first Salon success came with the exhibition of a painting \"Oedipus Taken down from the Tree\", and in 1848 his \"Winnower\" was bought by the government.\n\n\"The Captivity of the Jews in Babylon\", Millet's most ambitious work at the time, was unveiled at the Salon of 1848, but was scorned by art critics and the public alike. The painting eventually disappeared shortly thereafter, leading historians to believe that Millet destroyed it. In 1984, scientists at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston x-rayed Millet's 1870 painting \"The Young Shepherdess\" looking for minor changes, and discovered that it was painted over \"Captivity\". It is now believed that Millet reused the canvas when materials were in short supply during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nIn 1849, Millet painted \"Harvesters\", a commission for the state. In the Salon of that year, he exhibited \"Shepherdess Sitting at the Edge of the Forest\", a very small oil painting which marked a turning away from previous idealized pastoral subjects, in favor of a more realistic and personal approach. In June of that year, he settled in Barbizon with Catherine and their children.\n\nIn 1850 Millet entered into an arrangement with Sensier, who provided the artist with materials and money in return for drawings and paintings, while Millet simultaneously was free to continue selling work to other buyers as well. At that year's Salon, he exhibited \"Haymakers\" and \"The Sower\", his first major masterpiece and the earliest of the iconic trio of paintings that would include \"The Gleaners\" and \"The Angelus\".\n\nFrom 1850 to 1853, Millet worked on \"Harvesters Resting (Ruth and Boaz)\", a painting he would consider his most important, and on which he worked the longest. Conceived to rival his heroes Michelangelo and Poussin, it was also the painting that marked his transition from the depiction of symbolic imagery of peasant life to that of contemporary social conditions. It was the only painting he ever dated, and was the first work to garner him official recognition, a second-class medal at the 1853 salon.\n\nThis is one of the most well known of Millet's paintings, \"The Gleaners\" (1857). While Millet was walking the fields around Barbizon, one theme returned to his pencil and brush for seven years—gleaning—the centuries-old right of poor women and children to remove the bits of grain left in the fields following the harvest. He found the theme an eternal one, linked to stories from the Old Testament. In 1857, he submitted the painting \"The Gleaners\" to the Salon to an unenthusiastic, even hostile, public.\n\nA warm golden light suggests something sacred and eternal in this daily scene where the struggle to survive takes place. During his years of preparatory studies, Millet contemplated how best to convey the sense of repetition and fatigue in the peasants' daily lives. Lines traced over each woman's back lead to the ground and then back up in a repetitive motion identical to their unending, backbreaking labor. Along the horizon, the setting sun silhouettes the farm with its abundant stacks of grain, in contrast to the large shadowy figures in the foreground. The dark homespun dresses of the gleaners cut robust forms against the golden field, giving each woman a noble, monumental strength.\n\nThe painting was commissioned by Thomas Gold Appleton, an American art collector based in Boston, Massachusetts. Appleton previously studied with Millet's friend, the Barbizon painter Constant Troyon. It was completed during the summer of 1857. Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, \"Prayer for the Potato Crop\" to \"The Angelus\" when the purchaser failed to take possession of it in 1859. Displayed to the public for the first time in 1865, the painting changed hands several times, increasing only modestly in value, since some considered the artist's political sympathies suspect. Upon Millet's death a decade later, a bidding war between the US and France ensued, ending some years later with a price tag of 800,000 gold francs.\n\nThe disparity between the apparent value of the painting and the poor estate of Millet's surviving family was a major impetus in the invention of the droit de suite, intended to compensate artists or their heirs when works are resold.\n\nDespite mixed reviews of the paintings he exhibited at the Salon, Millet's reputation and success grew through the 1860s. At the beginning of the decade, he contracted to paint 25 works in return for a monthly stipend for the next three years and in 1865, another patron, Emile Gavet, began commissioning pastels for a collection that would eventually include 90 works. In 1867, the Exposition Universelle hosted a major showing of his work, with the \"Gleaners\", \"Angelus\", and \"Potato Planters\" among the paintings exhibited. The following year, Frédéric Hartmann commissioned \"Four Seasons\" for 25,000 francs, and Millet was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.\n\nIn 1870, Millet was elected to the Salon jury. Later that year, he and his family fled the Franco-Prussian War, moving to Cherbourg and Gréville, and did not return to Barbizon until late in 1871. His last years were marked by financial success and increased official recognition, but he was unable to fulfill government commissions due to failing health. On January 3, 1875, he married Catherine in a religious ceremony. Millet died on January 20, 1875.\n\nMillet was an important source of inspiration for Vincent van Gogh, particularly during his early period. Millet and his work are mentioned many times in Vincent's letters to his brother Theo. Millet's late landscapes would serve as influential points of reference to Claude Monet's paintings of the coast of Normandy; his structural and symbolic content influenced Georges Seurat as well.\n\nMillet is the main protagonist of Mark Twain's play \"Is He Dead?\" (1898), in which he is depicted as a struggling young artist who fakes his death to score fame and fortune. Most of the details about Millet in the play are fictional.\n\nMillet's painting \"L'homme à la houe\" inspired the famous poem \"The Man With the Hoe\" (1898) by Edwin Markham. His poems also served as the inspiration for American poet David Middleton's collection \"The Habitual Peacefulness of Gruchy: Poems After Pictures by Jean-François Millet\" (2005).\n\nThe \"Angelus\" was reproduced frequently in the 19th and 20th centuries. Salvador Dalí was fascinated by this work, and wrote an analysis of it, \"The Tragic Myth of The Angelus of Millet\". Rather than seeing it as a work of spiritual peace, Dalí believed it held messages of repressed sexual aggression. Dalí was also of the opinion that the two figures were praying over their buried child, rather than to the Angelus. Dalí was so insistent on this fact that eventually an X-ray was done of the canvas, confirming his suspicions: the painting contains a painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin. However, it is unclear whether Millet changed his mind on the meaning of the painting, or even if the shape actually is a coffin.\n\nBULLET::::- List of works by Henri Chapu\n\nBULLET::::- Champa, Kermit S. \"The Rise of Landscape Painting in France: Corot to Monet\".

{"id": "16313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16313", "title": "Jacques Callot", "text": "Jacques Callot\n\nJacques Callot (; – 1635) was a baroque printmaker and draftsman from the Duchy of Lorraine (an independent state on the north-eastern border of France, southwestern border of Germany and overlapping the southern Netherlands). He is an important person in the development of the old master print. He made more than 1,400 etchings that chronicled the life of his period, featuring soldiers, clowns, drunkards, Gypsies, beggars, as well as court life. He also etched many religious and military images, and many prints featured extensive landscapes in their background.\n\nCallot was born and died in Nancy, the capital of Lorraine, now in France. He came from an important family (his father was master of ceremonies at the court of the Duke), and he often describes himself as having noble status in the inscriptions to his prints. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a goldsmith, but soon afterward travelled to Rome where he learned engraving from an expatriate Frenchman, . He probably then studied etching with Antonio Tempesta in Florence, where he lived from 1612 to 1621. More than 2,000 preparatory drawings and studies for prints survive, but no paintings by him are known, and he probably never trained as a painter.\n\nDuring his period in Florence he became an independent master, and worked often for the Medici court. After the death of Cosimo II de' Medici during 1621, he returned to Nancy where he lived for the rest of his life, visiting Paris and the Netherlands later during the decade. He was commissioned by the courts of Lorraine, France and Spain, and by publishers, mostly in Paris. Although he remained in Nancy, his prints were distributed widely through Europe; Rembrandt was a keen collector of them.\n\nHis technique was exceptional, and was helped by important technical advances he made. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.\n\nHe also seems to have been responsible for an improved recipe for the etching ground that coated the plate and was removed to form the image, using lute-makers varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be etched more deeply, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of \"foul-biting\", such that acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been present, preventing an engraver from investing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined by foul-biting. Now etchers could do the very detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made good use of the new possibilities.\n\nHe also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple \"stoppings-out\" than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid dissolve lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep shallow by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small – as much as about six inches or 15 cm on their longest dimension.\n\nOne of his devotees, the Parisian Abraham Bosse spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.\n\nHis most famous prints are his two series of prints each on \"the Miseries and Misfortunes of War\". These are known as \"Les Grandes Misères de la guerre\", consisting of 18 prints published during 1633, and the earlier and incomplete \"Les Petites Misères\" — referring to their sizes, large and small (though even the large set are only about 8 x 13 cm). These images show soldiers pillaging and burning their way through towns, country and convents, before being variously arrested and executed by their superiors, lynched by peasants, or surviving to live as crippled beggars.

{"id": "16315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16315", "title": "Joseph Campbell", "text": "Joseph Campbell\n\nJoseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.\n\nSince the publication of \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", Campbell's theory has been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his \"Star Wars\" saga.\n\nJoseph Campbell was born in White Plains, New York, on March 26, 1904, the son of Josephine (née Lynch) and Charles William Campbell. He was from an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family. During his childhood, he moved with his family to nearby New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his grandmother.\n\nIn 1921, Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. While at Dartmouth College he studied biology and mathematics, but decided that he preferred the humanities. He transferred to Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1925 and a Master of Arts degree in medieval literature in 1927. At Dartmouth he had joined Delta Tau Delta. An accomplished athlete, he received awards in track and field events, and, for a time, was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.\n\nIn 1924, Campbell traveled to Europe with his family. On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the Theosophical Society, Jiddu Krishnamurti; they discussed Indian philosophy, sparking in Campbell an interest in Hindu and Indian thought. In 1927, he received a fellowship from Columbia University to study in Europe. Campbell studied Old French, Provençal, and Sanskrit at the University of Paris and the University of Munich. He learned to read and speak French and German.\n\nOn his return to Columbia University in 1929, Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and modern art in addition to Medieval literature. Lacking faculty approval, Campbell withdrew from graduate studies. Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the liberal arts, the discipline covering his work.\n\nWith the arrival of the Great Depression, Campbell spent the next five years (1929–1934) living in a rented shack in Woodstock, New York. There, he contemplated the next course of his life while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study. He later said that he \"would divide the day into four four-hour periods, of which I would be reading in three of the four-hour periods, and free one of them ... I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight.\"\n\nCampbell traveled to California for a year (1931–1932), continuing his independent studies and becoming close friends with the budding writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol. Campbell was introduced to the Steinbecks by author and early nutritionist Adelle Davis whom he met and developed a close relationship with on a cruise to the Caribbean with his father in December 1929. On the Monterey Peninsula, Campbell, like John Steinbeck, fell under the spell of the marine biologist Ed Ricketts (the model for \"Doc\" in Steinbeck's novel \"Cannery Row\" as well as central characters in several other novels). Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska on the \"Grampus\". Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but, unlike Steinbeck, did not complete his book.\n\nBruce Robison writes that\n\nCampbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in 1933 at the Canterbury School, during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction. While teaching at the Canterbury School, Campbell sold his first short story \"Strictly Platonic\" to \"Liberty\" magazine.\n\nIn 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College. In 1938, he married one of his former students, the dancer-choreographer Jean Erdman. For most of their 49 years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. They did not have any children.\n\nEarly in World War II, Campbell attended a lecture by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer; the two men became good friends. After Zimmer's death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer's papers, which he would do over the following decade.\n\nIn 1955–1956, as the last volume of Zimmer's posthumous (\"The Art of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformations\") was finally about to be published, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled, for the first time, to Asia. He spent six months in southern Asia (mostly India) and another six in East Asia (mostly Japan). This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth, and also on the necessity for teaching comparative mythology to a larger, non-academic audience.\n\nIn 1972, Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College, after having taught there for 38 years.\n\nCampbell attended a Grateful Dead concert in 1986, and marveled that \"Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here!\" With the Dead, Campbell put on a conference called \"Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead\".\n\nCampbell died at his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 30, 1987, from complications of esophageal cancer. Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with Bill Moyers that aired the following spring as \"The Power of Myth\". He is buried in O'ahu Cemetery, Honolulu.\n\nCampbell often referred to the work of modern writers James Joyce and Thomas Mann in his lectures and writings, as well as to the art of Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann.\n\nThe works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell's thinking; he quoted their writing frequently.\n\nThe \"follow your bliss\" philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of \"The Power of Myth\" (see below) derives from the Hindu Upanishads; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922 Sinclair Lewis novel \"Babbitt\". In \"The Power of Myth,\" Campbell quotes from the novel:\n\nThe anthropologist Leo Frobenius and his disciple Adolf Ellegard Jensen were important to Campbell's view of cultural history. Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof.\n\nCampbell's ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud, but in particular on the work of Jung, whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell. Campbell's conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation, which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation. Jung's insights into archetypes were heavily influenced by the \"Bardo Thodol\" (also known as \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead\"). In his book \"The Mythic Image\", Campbell quotes Jung's statement about the \"Bardo Thodol\", that it\n\nCampbell's concept of \"monomyth\" (one myth) refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Campbell often referred to the ideas of Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called \"folk\" and \"elementary\" ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as \"the hero's journey\" and was first described in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949). An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce, Campbell borrowed the term \"monomyth\" from Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\". Campbell also made heavy use of Carl Jung's theories on the structure of the human psyche, and he often used terms such as \"anima\"/\"animus\" and \"ego consciousness\".\n\nAs a strong believer in the psychic unity of mankind and its poetic expression through mythology, Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world \"\"transparent to transcendence\"\" by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time, suffering, and ultimately death. To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words, a seemingly impossible task, the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths. These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent. The Hero's Journey was the story of the man or woman who, through great suffering, reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free.\n\nAs this story spread through space and evolved through time, it was broken down into various local forms (masks), depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it. The basic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero's adventure through the story, stages such as \"the Call to Adventure, Receiving Supernatural Aid, Meeting with the Goddess/Atonement with the Father\" and \"Return\". These stages, as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story, provide the necessary metaphors to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey. Metaphor for Campbell, in contrast with \"comparisons\" which make use of the word \"like\", pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to, as in the sentence \"Jesus is the Son of God\" rather than \"the relationship of man to God is \"like\" that of a son to a father\".\n\nIn the 2000 documentary \"Joseph Campbell: A Hero's Journey\", he explains God in terms of a metaphor:\n\nGod is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.\n\nSome scholars have disagreed with the concept of the \"monomyth\" because of its oversimplification of different cultures. According to Robert Ellwood, \"A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking.\"\n\nCampbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society. These appear at the end of his work \"The Masks of God: Creative Mythology\", as well as various lectures.\n\nBULLET::::- The Metaphysical Function: \"Awakening a sense of awe before the mystery of being\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Cosmological Function: \"Explaining the shape of the universe\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Sociological Function: \"Validate and support the existing social order\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Pedagogical Function: \"Guide the individual through the stages of life\"\n\nCampbell's view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time, reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust. Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems. In brief these are:\n\nBULLET::::- The Way of the Animal Powers: \"Hunting and gathering societies\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Way of the Seeded Earth: \"Early agrarian societies\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Way of the Celestial Lights: \"The first high civilizations\"\n\nBULLET::::- The Way of Man: \"Medieval mythology, romantic love, and the birth of the modern spirit\"\n\nIn 1991, Campbell's widow, choreographer Jean Erdman, worked with Campbell's longtime friend and editor, Robert Walter, to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation.\n\nInitiatives undertaken by the JCF include: \"The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell\", a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell's myriad-minded work; the Erdman Campbell Award; the Mythological RoundTables, a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology, psychology, religion and culture; and the collection of Campbell's library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center.\n\nGeorge Lucas was the first Hollywood filmmaker to credit Campbell's influence. Lucas stated, following the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film in 1977, that its story was shaped, in part, by ideas described in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" and other works of Campbell's. The linkage between \"Star Wars\" and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell's book used the image of Luke Skywalker on the cover. Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell, \"A Fire in the Mind\":\n\nI came to the conclusion after \"American Graffiti\" that what's valuable for me is to set standards, not to show people the world the way it is...around the period of this realization...it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology...The Western was possibly the last generically American fairy tale, telling us about our values. And once the Western disappeared, nothing has ever taken its place. In literature we were going off into science fiction...so that's when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales, folklore, and mythology, and I started reading Joe's books. Before that I hadn't read any of Joe's books...It was very eerie because in reading \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" I began to realize that my first draft of \"Star Wars\" was following classic motifs... So I modified my next draft according to what I'd been learning about classical motifs and made it a little bit more consistent...I went on to read 'The Masks of God' and many other books.\n\nIt was not until after the completion of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy in 1983, however, that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures. In 1984, Campbell gave a lecture at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, with Lucas in the audience, who was introduced through their mutual friend Barbara McClintock. A few years later, Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire \"Star Wars\" trilogy at Skywalker Ranch, which Campbell called \"real art\". This meeting led to the filming of the 1988 documentary \"The Power of Myth\" at Skywalker Ranch. In his interviews with Bill Moyers, Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used \"The Hero's Journey\" in the \"Star Wars\" films (IV, V, and VI) to re-invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer. Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999 called the \"Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas & Bill Moyers\" to further discuss the impact of Campbell's work on Lucas' films. In addition, the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\", which discussed the ways in which Campbell's work shaped the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\nMany filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell's work on their own craft. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood screenwriter, created a seven-page company memo based on Campbell's work, \"A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces\", which led to the development of Disney's 1994 film \"The Lion King\". Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are \"The Matrix\" series, the Batman series and the \"Indiana Jones\" series. Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV show \"Community\", often references Campbell as a major influence. According to him, he uses a \"story circle\" to formulate every story he writes, in a formulation of Campbell's work.\n\nAfter the explosion of popularity brought on by the \"Star Wars\" films and \"The Power of Myth\", creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell's theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns. Novelists, songwriters, video game designers have studied Campbell's work in order to better understand mythology – in particular, the monomyth – and its impact.\n\nThe novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth. In his best known work, \"Watership Down\", Adams uses extracts from \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" as chapter epigrams.\n\nDan Brown mentioned in a \"New York Times\" interview that Joseph Campbell's works, particularly \"The Power of Myth\" and \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon.\n\nOne of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to \"follow your bliss\". He derived this idea from the Upanishads:\n\nNow, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat-Chit-Ananda. The word \"Sat\" means being. \"Chit\" means consciousness. \"Ananda\" means bliss or rapture. I thought, \"I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being.\" I think it worked.\n\nHe saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:\n\nIf you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are—if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.\n\nCampbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that \"The Power of Myth\" was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell's death, \"Follow your bliss\" was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American public—both religious and secular.\n\nDuring his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism, Campbell is reported to have grumbled, \"I should have said, 'Follow your \"blisters\".'\"\n\nCampbell's scholarship and understanding of Sanskrit has been questioned. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto, said that he once met Campbell, and that the two \"hated each other at sight\", commenting that, \"When I met Campbell at a public gathering, he was quoting Sanskrit verses. He had no clue as to what he was talking about; he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement. I remember thinking: this man is corrupt. I know that he was simply \"lying\" about his understanding\". According to Richard Buchen, librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well. However, Buchen adds that Campbell worked closely with three scholars who did translate Sanskrit well.\n\nEllwood observes that \"The Masks of God\" series \"impressed literate laity more than specialists\"; he quotes Stephen P. Dunn as remarking that in \"Occidental Mythology\" Campbell \"writes in a curiously archaic style – full of rhetorical questions, exclamations of wonder and delight, and expostulations directed at the reader, or perhaps at the author's other self – which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest.\" Ellwood notes that \"Campbell was not really a social scientist, and those in the latter camp could tell\" and records a concern about Campbell's \"oversimpification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean\". The critic Camille Paglia, writing in \"Sexual Personae\" (1990), expressed disagreement with Campbell's \"negative critique of fifth-century Athens\" in \"Occidental Mythology\", arguing that Campbell missed the \"visionary and exalted\" androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys. Paglia has written that while Campbell is \"a seminal figure for many American feminists\", she loathes him for his \"mawkishness and bad research.\" Paglia has called Campbell \"mushy\" and a \"false teacher\", and described his work as a \"fanciful, showy mishmash\".\n\nCampbell has also been accused of antisemitism by some authors. In a 1989 \"New York Review of Books\" article, Brendan Gill accused Campbell of both antisemitism and prejudice against blacks. Gill's article resulted in a series of letters to the editor, some supporting the charge of antisemitism or accusing Campbell of having various right-wing biases, others defending him. However, according to Robert Ellwood, Gill relied on \"scraps of evidence, largely anecdotal\" to support his charges. In 1991, Masson also accused Campbell of \"hidden anti-Semitism\" and \"fascination with conservative, semifascistic views\". Contrarily, the \"fascist undercurrents\" in Campbell's work and especially its influence on \"Star Wars\" have been called \"a reminder of how easily totalitarianism can knock at any society's door.\"\n\nThe religious studies scholar Russell T. McCutcheon characterized the \"following [of] the bliss of self-realization\" in Campbell's work as \"spiritual and psychological legitimation\" for Reaganomics.\n\nThe first published work that bore Campbell's name was \"Where the Two Came to Their Father\" (1943), an account of a Navajo ceremony that was performed by singer (medicine man) Jeff King and recorded by artist and ethnologist Maud Oakes, recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the hogan of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. Campbell provided a commentary. He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars (\"folk ideas\") of Native American stories.\n\nAs noted above, James Joyce was an important influence on Campbell. Campbell's first important book (with Henry Morton Robinson), \"A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake\" (1944), is a critical analysis of Joyce's final text \"Finnegans Wake\". In addition, Campbell's seminal work, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), discusses what Campbell called the \"monomyth\" – the cycle of the journey of the hero – a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nFrom his days in college through the 1940s, Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction. In many of his later stories (published in the posthumous collection \"Mythic Imagination\") he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes. These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non-fiction.\n\nOriginally titled \"How to Read a Myth\", and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at Sarah Lawrence College, \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" was published in 1949 as Campbell's first foray as a solo author; it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains, arguably, his most influential work to this day. The book argues that hero stories such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis. Not only did it introduce the concept of the hero's journey to popular thinking, but it also began to popularize the very idea of comparative mythology itself—the study of the human impulse to create stories and images that, though they are clothed in the motifs of a particular time and place, draw nonetheless on universal, eternal themes. Campbell asserted:\n\nWherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd. When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved.\n\nPublished between 1959 and 1968, Campbell's four-volume work \"The Masks of God\" covers mythology from around the world, from ancient to modern. Where \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" focused on the commonality of mythology (the \"elementary ideas\"), the \" Masks of God\" books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on (the \"folk ideas\"). In other words, where \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" draws perhaps more from psychology, the \" Masks of God\" books draw more from anthropology and history. The four volumes of \"Masks of God\" are as follows: \"Primitive Mythology\", \"Oriental Mythology\", \"Occidental Mythology\", and \"Creative Mythology\".\n\nThe book is quoted by proponents of the Christ myth theory. Campbell writes, \"It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles.\"\n\nAt the time of his death, Campbell was in the midst of working on a large-format, lavishly illustrated series titled \"Historical Atlas of World Mythology\". This series was to build on Campbell's idea, first presented in \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", that myth evolves over time through four stages:\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Way of the Animal Powers\"—the myths of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers which focus on shamanism and animal totems.\nBULLET::::- \"The Way of the Seeded Earth\"—the myths of Neolithic, agrarian cultures which focus upon a mother goddess and associated fertility rites.\nBULLET::::- \"The Way of the Celestial Lights\"—the myths of Bronze Age city-states with pantheons of gods ruling from the heavens, led by a masculine god-king.\nBULLET::::- \"The Way of Man\"—religion and philosophy as it developed after the Axial Age (c. 6th century BC), in which the mythic imagery of previous eras was made consciously metaphorical, reinterpreted as referring to psycho-spiritual, not literal-historical, matters. This transition is evident in the East in Buddhism, Vedanta, and philosophical Taoism; and in the West in the Mystery cults, Platonism, Christianity and Gnosticism.\n\nOnly the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell's death. Campbell's editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell's death. The works are now out of print. , Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new, ebook edition.\n\nCampbell's widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with Bill Moyers on the PBS series \"The Power of Myth\", which was first broadcast in 1988, the year following Campbell's death. The series discusses mythological, religious, and psychological archetypes. A book, \"The Power of Myth\", containing expanded transcripts of their conversations, was released shortly after the original broadcast.\n\nThe \"Collected Works of Joseph Campbell\" series is a project initiated by the Joseph Campbell Foundation to release new, authoritative editions of Campbell's published and unpublished writing, as well as audio and video recordings of his lectures. Working with New World Library and Acorn Media UK, as well as publishing audio recordings and ebooks under its own banner, the project has produced over seventy-five titles. The series's executive editor is Robert Walter, and the managing editor is David Kudler.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Where the Two Came to Their Father: A Navaho War Ceremonial\" (1943).

{"id": "16316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16316", "title": "John Dowland", "text": "John Dowland\n\nJohn Dowland (1563 – buried 20 February 1626) was an English Renaissance composer, lutenist, and singer. He is best known today for his melancholy songs such as \"Come, heavy sleep\", \"Come again\", \"Flow my tears\", \"I saw my Lady weepe\" and \"In darkness let me dwell\", but his instrumental music has undergone a major revival, and with the 20th century's early music revival, has been a continuing source of repertoire for lutenists and classical guitarists.\n\nVery little is known of John Dowland's early life, but it is generally thought he was born in London; some sources even put his birth year as 1562. Irish historian W. H. Grattan Flood claimed that he was born in Dalkey, near Dublin, but no corroborating evidence has ever been found either for that or for Thomas Fuller's claim that he was born in Westminster. There is however one very clear piece of evidence pointing to Dublin as his place of origin: he dedicated the song \"From Silent Night\" to 'my loving countryman Mr. John Forster the younger, merchant of Dublin in Ireland'. The Forsters were a prominent Dublin family at the time, providing several Lord Mayors to the city.\n\nIn 1580 Dowland went to Paris, where he was in service to Sir Henry Cobham, the ambassador to the French court, and his successor Sir Edward Stafford. He became a Roman Catholic at this time. In 1584, Dowland moved back to England and married. In 1588 he was admitted Mus. Bac. from Christ Church, Oxford. In 1594 a vacancy for a lutenist came up at the English court, but Dowland's application was unsuccessful – he claimed his religion led to his not being offered a post at Elizabeth I's Protestant court. However, his conversion was not publicised, and being Catholic did not prevent some other important musicians (such as William Byrd) from a court career.\n\nFrom 1598 Dowland worked at the court of Christian IV of Denmark, though he continued to publish in London. King Christian was very interested in music and paid Dowland astronomical sums; his salary was 500 daler a year, making him one of the highest-paid servants of the Danish court. Though Dowland was highly regarded by King Christian, he was not the ideal servant, often overstaying his leave when he went to England on publishing business or for other reasons. Dowland was dismissed in 1606 and returned to England; in early 1612 he secured a post as one of James I's lutenists. There are few compositions dating from the moment of his royal appointment until his death in London in 1626. While the date of his death is not known, \"Dowland's last payment from the court was on 20 January 1626, and he was buried at St Ann's, Blackfriars, London, on 20 February 1626.\"\n\nTwo major influences on Dowland's music were the popular consort songs, and the dance music of the day. Most of Dowland's music is for his own instrument, the lute. It includes several books of solo lute works, lute songs (for one voice and lute), part-songs with lute accompaniment, and several pieces for viol consort with lute. The poet Richard Barnfield wrote that Dowland's \"heavenly touch upon the lute doth ravish human sense.\"\n\nOne of his better known works is the lute song \"Flow my tears\", the first verse of which runs:\n\nHe later wrote what is probably his best known instrumental work, \"Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares, Figured in Seaven Passionate Pavans\", a set of seven pavanes for five viols and lute, each based on the theme derived from the lute song \"Flow my tears\". It became one of the best known collections of consort music in his time. His pavane, \"Lachrymae antiquae\", was also popular in the seventeenth century, and was arranged and used as a theme for variations by many composers. He wrote a lute version of the popular ballad \"My Lord Willoughby's Welcome Home\".\n\nDowland's music often displays the melancholia that was so fashionable in music at that time. He wrote a consort piece with the punning title \"\"Semper Dowland, semper dolens\"\" (always Dowland, always doleful), which may be said to sum up much of his work.\n\nRichard Barnfield, Dowland's contemporary, refers to him in poem VIII of \"The Passionate Pilgrim\" (1598), a Shakespearean sonnet:\n\nOnly one comprehensive monograph of Dowland's life and works is available in print. The fullest list is that compiled by Diana Poulton in her \"The collected Lute Music of John Dowland\". \"P\" numbers are therefore sometimes used to designate individual pieces.\n\nPublished by Thomas Est in 1592, \"The Whole Booke of Psalmes\" contained works by 10 composers, including 6 pieces by Dowland.\nBULLET::::1. Put me not to rebuke, O Lord (Psalm 38)\nBULLET::::2. All people that on earth do dwell (Psalm 100)\nBULLET::::3. My soul praise the Lord (Psalm 104)\nBULLET::::4. Lord to thee I make my moan (Psalm 130)\nBULLET::::5. Behold and have regard (Psalm 134)\nBULLET::::6. A Prayer for the Queens most excellent Maiestie\n\nThe \"New Booke of Tabliture\" was published by William Barley in 1596. It contains seven solo lute pieces by Dowland.\n\nWritten for the professional choir of Westminster Abbey.\nBULLET::::1. The Lamentation of a sinner\nBULLET::::2. Domine ne in furore (Psalm 6)\nBULLET::::3. Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51)\nBULLET::::4. The humble sute of a sinner\nBULLET::::5. The humble complaint of a sinner\nBULLET::::6.

I shame at my unworthiness\n\nDowland in London in 1597 published his \"First Booke of Songes or Ayres\", a set of 21 lute-songs and one of the most influential collections in the history of the lute. It is set out in a way that allows performance by a soloist with lute accompaniment or by various other combinations of singers and instrumentalists. The lute-songs are listed below. After them, at the end of the collection, comes \"My Lord Chamberlaine, His Galliard\", a piece for two people to play on one lute.\nBULLET::::1. Vnquiet thoughts\nBULLET::::2.

Cease these false sports\nBULLET::::22. A Galliard to Lachrimae\n\nMany of Dowland's works survive only in manuscript form.\n\nDowland performed a number of espionage assignments for Sir Robert Cecil in France and Denmark; despite his high rate of pay, Dowland seems to have been only a court musician. However, we have in his own words the fact that he was for a time embroiled in treasonous Catholic intrigue in Italy, whither he had travelled in the hopes of meeting and studying with Luca Marenzio, a famed madrigal composer. Whatever his religion, however, he was still intensely loyal to the Queen, though he seems to have had something of a grudge against her for her remark that he, Dowland, \"was a man to serve any prince in the world, but [he] was an obstinate Papist.\" But in spite of this, and though the plotters offered him a large sum of money from the Pope, as well as safe passage for his wife and children to come to him from England, in the end he declined to have anything further to do with their plans and begged pardon from Sir Robert Cecil and from the Queen.\n\nJohn Dowland was married and had children, as referenced in his letter to Sir Robert Cecil. However, he had long periods of separation from his family, as his wife stayed in England while he worked on the Continent.\n\nHis son Robert Dowland (c. 1591 – 1641) was also a musician, working for some time in the service of the first Earl of Devonshire, and taking over his father's position of lutenist at court when John died.\n\nDowland's melancholic lyrics and music have often been described as his attempts to develop an \"artistic persona\" in spite of actually being a cheerful person, but many of his own personal complaints, and the tone of bitterness in many of his comments, suggest that much of his music and his melancholy truly did come from his own personality and frustration.\n\nOne of the first 20th-century musicians who successfully helped reclaim Dowland from the history books was the singer-songwriter Frederick Keel. Keel included fifteen Dowland pieces in his two sets of \"Elizabethan love songs\" published in 1909 and 1913, which achieved popularity in their day. These free arrangements for piano and low or high voice were intended to fit the tastes and musical practices associated with art songs of the time.\n\nIn 1935, Australian-born composer Percy Grainger, who also had a deep interest in music made before Bach, arranged Dowland's \"Now, O now I needs must part\" for piano. Some years later, in 1953, Grainger wrote a work titled \"Bell Piece (Ramble on John Dowland's 'Now, O now I needs must part')\", which was a version scored for voice and wind band, based on his previously mentioned transcription.\n\nIn 1951 Alfred Deller, the famous counter-tenor (1912–1979), recorded songs by Dowland, Thomas Campion, and Philip Rosseter with the label HMV (His Master's Voice) HMV C.4178 and another HMV C.4236 of Dowland's \"Flow my Tears\". In 1977, Harmonia Mundi also published two records of Deller singing Dowland's Lute songs (HM 244&245-H244/246).\n\nDowland's song \"Come Heavy Sleepe, the Image of True Death\" was the inspiration for Benjamin Britten's \"Nocturnal after John Dowland\", written in 1963 for the guitarist Julian Bream. It consists of eight variations, all based on musical themes drawn from the song or its lute accompaniment, finally resolving into a guitar setting of the song itself.\n\nDowland's music became part of the repertoire of the early music revival with lutenist Julian Bream and tenor Peter Pears, and later with Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s and later with the Academy of Ancient Music from the early 1970s.\n\nJan Akkerman, guitarist of the Dutch progressive rock band Focus, recorded \"Tabernakel\" in 1973 (though released in 1974), an album of John Dowland songs and some original material, performed on lute.\n\nThe complete works of John Dowland were recorded by the Consort of Musicke, and released on the L'Oiseau Lyre label, though they recorded some of the songs as vocal consort music; the \"Third Book of Songs\" and \"A Pilgrim's Solace\" have yet to be recorded in their entirety as collections of solo songs.\n\nThe 1999 ECM New Series recording \"In Darkness Let Me Dwell\" features new interpretations of Dowland songs performed by tenor John Potter, lutenist Stephen Stubbs, and baroque violinist Maya Homburger in collaboration with English jazz musicians John Surman and Barry Guy.\n\nNigel North recorded Dowland's complete works for solo lute on four CDs between 2004 and 2007, on Naxos records.\n\nPaul O'Dette recorded the complete lute works for Harmonia Mundi on five CDs issued from 1995 to 1997.\n\nElvis Costello included a recording (with Fretwork and the Composers Ensemble) of Dowland's \"Can she excuse my wrongs\" as a bonus track on the 2006 re-release of his \"The Juliet Letters\".\n\nIn October 2006, Sting, who says he has been fascinated by the music of John Dowland for 25 years, released an album featuring Dowland's songs titled \"Songs from the Labyrinth\", on Deutsche Grammophon, in collaboration with Edin Karamazov on lute and archlute. They described their treatment of Dowland's work in a \"Great Performances\" appearance. To give some idea of the tone and intrigues of life in late Elizabethan England, Sting also recites throughout the album portions of a 1593 letter written by Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil. The letter describes Dowland's travels to various points of Western Europe, then breaks into a detailed account of his activities in Italy, along with a heartfelt denial of the charges of treason whispered against him by unknown persons. Dowland most likely was suspected of this for travelling to the courts of various Catholic monarchs and accepting payment from them greater than what a musician of the time would normally have received for performing.\n\nSF writer Philip K. Dick referred to Dowland in many of his works, even using pseudonym \"Jack Dowland\" once.\n\n\"The Collected Lute Music of John Dowland\", with lute tablature and keyboard notation, was transcribed and edited by Diana Poulton and Basil Lam, Faber Music Limited, London 1974.\n\nBULLET::::- 2004/2009.

{"id": "16317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16317", "title": "John James Audubon", "text": "John James Audubon\n\nJohn James Audubon (born Jean Rabin; April 26, 1785 – January 27, 1851) was an American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter. He was notable for his extensive studies documenting all types of American birds and for his detailed illustrations that depicted the birds in their natural habitats. His major work, a color-plate book entitled \"The Birds of America\" (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Audubon identified 25 new species.\n\nAudubon was born in Les Cayes in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) on his father's sugarcane plantation. He was the son of Lieutenant Jean Audubon, a French naval officer (and privateer) from the south of Brittany, and his mistress, Jeanne Rabine, a 27-year-old chambermaid from Les Touches, Brittany (now in the modern region Pays de la Loire). They named him Jean Rabin. Another 1887 biographer has stated that his mother was a lady from a Louisiana plantation. His mother died when he was a few months old, as she had suffered from tropical disease since arriving on the island. His father already had an unknown number of mixed-race children (among them a daughter named Marie-Madeleine), some by his mixed race housekeeper, Catherine \"Sanitte\" Bouffard (described as a quadroon, meaning she was three-quarters European in ancestry). Following Jeanne Rabin's death, Audubon renewed his relationship with Sanitte Bouffard and had a daughter by her, named Muguet. Bouffard also took care of the infant boy Jean.\n\nThe senior Audubon had commanded ships. During the American Revolution, he had been imprisoned by Britain. After his release, he helped the American cause. He had long worked to save money and secure his family's future with real estate. Due to slave unrest in the Caribbean, in 1789 he sold part of his plantation in Saint-Domingue and purchased a 284-acre farm called Mill Grove, 20 miles from Philadelphia, to diversify his investments. Increasing tension in Saint-Domingue between the colonists and the African slaves, who greatly outnumbered them, convinced Jean Audubon to return to France, where he became a member of the Republican Guard. In 1791 he arranged for his natural children, Jean and Muguet, who were majority-white in ancestry, to be transported and delivered to him in France.\n\nThe children were raised in Couëron, near Nantes, France, by Audubon and his French wife, Anne Moynet Audubon, whom he had married years before his time in Saint-Domingue. In 1794 they formally adopted both his natural children to regularize their legal status in France. They renamed the boy Jean-Jacques Fougère Audubon and the girl Rose. When Audubon, at age 18, boarded ship in 1803 to immigrate to the United States, he changed his name to an anglicized form: John James Audubon.\n\nFrom his earliest days, Audubon had an affinity for birds. \"I felt an intimacy with them...bordering on frenzy [that] must accompany my steps through life.\" His father encouraged his interest in nature:\n\nHe would point out the elegant movement of the birds, and the beauty and softness of their plumage. He called my attention to their show of pleasure or sense of danger, their perfect forms and splendid attire. He would speak of their departure and return with the seasons.\n\nIn France during the chaotic years of the French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon grew up to be a handsome and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back on solid ground and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.\n\nIn 1803, his father obtained a false passport so that Audubon could go to the United States to avoid conscription in the Napoleonic Wars. Jean Audubon and Claude Rozier arranged a business partnership for their sons to pursue in Pennsylvania. It was based on Claude Rozier's buying half of Jean Audubon's share of a plantation in Haiti, and lending money to the partnership as secured by half interest in lead mining at Audubon's property of Mill Grove.\n\nAudubon caught yellow fever upon arrival in New York City. The ship's captain placed him in a boarding house run by Quaker women. They nursed Audubon to recovery and taught him English, including the Quaker form of using \"thee\" and \"thou\", otherwise then archaic. He traveled with the family's Quaker lawyer to the Audubon family farm Mill Grove. The homestead is located on the Perkiomen Creek a few miles from Valley Forge.\n\nAudubon lived with the tenants in the two-story stone house, in an area that he considered a paradise. \"Hunting, fishing, drawing, and music occupied my every moment; cares I knew not, and cared naught about them.\" Studying his surroundings, Audubon quickly learned the ornithologist's rule, which he wrote down as, \"The nature of the place—whether high or low, moist or dry, whether sloping north or south, or bearing tall trees or low shrubs—generally gives hint as to its inhabitants.\"\n\nHis father hoped that the lead mines on the property could be commercially developed, as lead was an essential component of bullets. This could provide his son with a profitable occupation. At Mill Grove, Audubon met the owner of the nearby estate Fatland Ford, William Bakewell, and his daughter Lucy. He was married to Lucy five years later. The two young people shared many common interests, and early on began to spend time together, exploring the natural world around them.\n\nAudubon set about to study American birds, determined to illustrate his findings in a more realistic manner than most artists did then. He began conducting the first known bird-banding on the continent: he tied yarn to the legs of eastern phoebes and determined that they returned to the same nesting spots year after year. He also began drawing and painting birds, and recording their behavior. After an accidental fall into a creek, Audubon contracted a severe fever. He was nursed and recovered at Fatland Ford, with Lucy at his side.\n\nRisking conscription in France, Audubon returned in 1805 to see his father and ask permission to marry. He also needed to discuss family business plans. While there, he met the naturalist and physician Charles-Marie D'Orbigny, who improved Audubon's taxidermy skills and taught him scientific methods of research. Although his return ship was overtaken by an English privateer, Audubon and his hidden gold coins survived the encounter.\n\nAudubon resumed his bird studies and created his own nature museum, perhaps inspired by the great museum of natural history created by Charles Willson Peale in Philadelphia. Peale's bird exhibits were considered scientifically advanced. Audubon's room was brimming with birds' eggs, stuffed raccoons and opossums, fish, snakes, and other creatures. He had become proficient at specimen preparation and taxidermy.\n\nDeeming the mining venture too risky, with his father's approval Audubon sold part of the Mill Grove farm, including the house and mine. He retained some land for investment. He went to New York to learn the import-export trade, hoping to find a business to support his marriage to Lucy. The protective Mr. Bakewell wanted to see the young Frenchman established in a solid career before releasing his daughter to him.\n\nIn 1808, Audubon moved to Kentucky, which was rapidly being settled. Six months later, he married Lucy Bakewell. Though their finances were tenuous, the Audubons started a family. They had two sons: Victor Gifford (1809–1860) and John Woodhouse Audubon (1812–1862); and two daughters who died while still young: Lucy at two years (1815–1817) and Rose at nine months (1819–1820). Both sons would eventually help publish their father's works. John W. Audubon became a naturalist, writer, and painter in his own right.\n\nAudubon and Jean Ferdinand Rozier moved their merchant business partnership west at various stages, ending ultimately in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, a former French colonial settlement west of the Mississippi River and south of St. Louis. Shipping goods ahead, Audubon and Rozier started a general store in Louisville, Kentucky on the Ohio River; the city had an increasingly important slave market and was the most important port between Pittsburgh and New Orleans. Soon he was drawing bird specimens again. He regularly burned his earlier efforts to force continuous improvement. He also took detailed field notes to document his drawings.\n\nDue to rising tensions with the British, President Jefferson ordered an embargo on British trade in 1808, adversely affecting Audubon's trading business. In 1810, Audubon moved his business further west to the less competitive Henderson, Kentucky, area. He and his small family took over an abandoned log cabin. In the fields and forests, Audubon wore typical frontier clothes and moccasins, having \"a ball pouch, a buffalo horn filled with gunpowder, a butcher knife, and a tomahawk on his belt.\"\n\nHe frequently turned to hunting and fishing to feed his family, as business was slow. On a prospecting trip down the Ohio River with a load of goods, Audubon joined up with Shawnee and Osage hunting parties, learning their methods, drawing specimens by the bonfire, and finally parting \"like brethren.\" Audubon had great respect for Native Americans: \"Whenever I meet Indians, I feel the greatness of our Creator in all its splendor, for there I see the man naked from His hand and yet free from acquired sorrow.\" Audubon also admired the skill of Kentucky riflemen and the \"regulators\", citizen lawmen who created a kind of justice on the Kentucky frontier. In his travel notes, he claims to have encountered Daniel Boone.\n\nAudubon and Rozier mutually agreed to end their partnership at Ste. Genevieve on April 6, 1811. Audubon had decided to work at ornithology and art, and wanted to return to Lucy and their son in Kentucky. Rozier agreed to pay Audubon $3,000 (equivalent to ~$120,000 in 2010 dollars), with $1,000 in cash and the balance to be paid over time.\n\nThe terms of the dissolution of the partnership include those by Audubon:\n\nAudubon was working in Missouri and out riding when the 1811 New Madrid earthquake struck. When Audubon reached his house, he was relieved to find no major damage, but the area was shaken by aftershocks for months. The quake is estimated by scholars to have ranked from 8.4 to 8.8 on today's Richter Scale of severity, stronger than the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 which is estimated at 7.8. Audubon writes that while on horseback, he first believed the distant rumbling to be the sound of a tornado,\n\nbut the animal knew better than I what was forthcoming, and instead of going faster, so nearly stopped that I remarked he placed one foot after another on the ground with as much precaution as if walking on a smooth piece of ice. I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.\n\nHe noted that as the earthquake retreated, \"the air was filled with an extremely disagreeable sulphurous odor.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Philadelphia in 1812 following Congress' declaration of war against Great Britain, Audubon became an American citizen and had to give up his French citizenship. After his return to Kentucky, he found that rats had eaten his entire collection of more than 200 drawings. After weeks of depression, he took to the field again, determined to re-do his drawings to an even higher standard.\n\nThe War of 1812 upset Audubon's plans to move his business to New Orleans. He formed a partnership with Lucy's brother and built up their trade in Henderson. Between 1812 and the Panic of 1819, times were good. Audubon bought land and slaves, founded a flour mill, and enjoyed his growing family. After 1819, Audubon went bankrupt and was thrown into jail for debt. The little money he earned was from drawing portraits, particularly death-bed sketches, greatly esteemed by country folk before photography. He wrote, \"[M]y heart was sorely heavy, for scarcely had I enough to keep my dear ones alive; and yet through these dark days I was being led to the development of the talents I loved.\"\n\nAudubon worked for a brief time as the first paid employee of the Western History Society, now known as The Museum of Natural History at The Cincinnati Museum Center . He then traveled south on the Mississippi with his gun, paintbox, and assistant Joseph Mason, who stayed with him from October 1820 to August 1822 and painted the plant life backgrounds of many of Audubon's bird studies. He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson. Though he could not afford to buy Wilson's work, Audubon used it to guide him when he had access to a copy.\n\nIn 1818, Rafinesque visited Kentucky and the Ohio River valley to study fishes and was a guest of Audubon. In the middle of the night, Rafinesque noticed a bat in his room and thought it was a new species. He happened to grab Audubon's favourite violin in an effort to knock the bat down, resulting in the destruction of the violin. Audubon reportedly took revenge by showing drawings and describing some fictitious fishes and rodents to Rafinesque; Rafinesque gave scientific names to some of these fishes in his \"Ichthyologia Ohiensis\".\n\nOn October 12, 1820, Audubon traveled into Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida in search of ornithological specimens. He traveled with George Lehman, a professional Swiss landscape artist. The following summer, he moved upriver to the Oakley Plantation in Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, where he taught drawing to Eliza Pirrie, the young daughter of the owners. Though low-paying, the job was ideal, as it afforded him much time to roam and paint in the woods. (The plantation has been preserved as the Audubon State Historic Site, and is located at 11788 Highway 965, between Jackson and St. Francisville.)\n\nAudubon called his future work \"The Birds of America\". He attempted to paint one page each day. Painting with newly discovered technique, he decided his earlier works were inferior and re-did them. He hired hunters to gather specimens for him. Audubon realized the ambitious project would take him away from his family for months at a time.\n\nAudubon sometimes used his drawing talent to trade for goods or sell small works to raise cash. He made charcoal portraits on demand at $5 each and gave drawing lessons. In 1823 Audubon took lessons in oil painting technique from John Steen, a teacher of American landscape, and history painter Thomas Cole. Though he did not use oils much for his bird work, Audubon earned good money painting oil portraits for patrons along the Mississippi. (Audubon's account reveals that he learned oil painting in December 1822 from Jacob Stein, an itinerant portrait artist. After they had enjoyed all the portrait patronage to be expected in Natchez, Mississippi, during January–March 1823, they resolved to travel together as perambulating portrait-artists.) During this period (1822–1823), Audubon also worked as an instructor at Jefferson College in Washington, Mississippi.\n\nLucy became the steady breadwinner for the couple and their two young sons. Trained as a teacher, she conducted classes for children in their home. Later she was hired as a local teacher in Louisiana. She boarded with their children at the home of a wealthy plantation owner, as was often the custom of the time.\n\nIn 1824, Audubon returned to Philadelphia to seek a publisher for his bird drawings. Though he met Thomas Sully, one of the most famous portrait painters of the time and a valuable ally, Audubon was rebuffed for publication. He had earned the enmity of some of the city's leading scientists at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He took oil painting lessons from Sully and met Charles Bonaparte, who admired his work and recommended he go to Europe to have his bird drawings engraved. Bonaparte also recommended Audubon for membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences, This failed partly because of opposition by ornithologist George Ord who disliked Audubon's dramatic bird poses and considered him to be a \"a back-country upstart who romanticized his subject matter,\" according to the Audubon Galleries.\n\nWith his wife's support, in 1826 at age 41, Audubon took his growing collection of work to England. He sailed from New Orleans to Liverpool on the cotton hauling ship \"Delos\", reaching England in the autumn of 1826 with his portfolio of over 300 drawings. With letters of introduction to prominent Englishmen, Audubon gained their quick attention. \"I have been received here in a manner not to be expected during my highest enthusiastic hopes.\"\nThe British could not get enough of Audubon's images of backwoods America and its natural attractions. He met with great acceptance as he toured around England and Scotland, and was lionized as \"the American woodsman.\" He raised enough money to begin publishing his \"The Birds of America\". This monumental work consists of 435 hand-colored, life-size prints of 497 bird species, made from engraved copper plates of various sizes depending on the size of the image. They were printed on sheets measuring about 39 by . The work contains slightly more than 700 North American bird species, of which some was based on specimens collected by fellow ornithologist John Kirk Townsend on his journey across America with Thomas Nuttall in 1834 as part of Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth's second expedition across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe pages were organized for artistic effect and contrasting interest, as if the reader were taking a visual tour. (Some critics thought he should have organized the plates in Linnaean order as befitting a \"serious\" ornithological treatise.) The first and perhaps most famous plate was the wild turkey.\n\nThe cost of printing the entire work was $115,640 (over $2,000,000 today), paid for from advance subscriptions, exhibitions, oil painting commissions, and animal skins, which Audubon hunted and sold. Audubon's great work was a remarkable accomplishment. It took more than 14 years of field observations and drawings, plus his single-handed management and promotion of the project to make it a success. A reviewer wrote,\n\nAll anxieties and fears which overshadowed his work in its beginning had passed away. The prophecies of kind but overprudent friends, who did not understand his self-sustaining energy, had proved untrue; the malicious hope of his enemies, for even the gentle lover of nature has enemies, had been disappointed; he had secured a commanding place in the respect and gratitude of men.\n\nColorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work). The original edition was engraved in aquatint by Robert Havell, Jr., who took over the task after the first ten plates engraved by W. H. Lizars were deemed inadequate. Known as the Double Elephant folio after its double elephant paper size, it is often regarded as the greatest picture book ever produced and the finest aquatint work. By the 1830s, the aquatint process was largely superseded by lithography. A contemporary French critic wrote, \"A magic power transported us into the forests which for so many years this man of genius has trod. Learned and ignorant alike were astonished at the spectacle ... It is a real and palpable vision of the New World.\"\n\nAudubon sold oil-painted copies of the drawings to make extra money and publicize the book. A potential publisher had his portrait painted by John Syme, who clothed the naturalist in frontier clothes. The portrait was hung at the entrance of his exhibitions, promoting his rustic image. (The painting is now held in the White House art collection, and is not frequently displayed.). The New-York Historical Society holds all 435 of the preparatory watercolors for \"The Birds of America\". Lucy Audubon sold them to the society after her husband's death. All but 80 of the original copper plates were melted down when Lucy Audubon, desperate for money, sold them for scrap to the Phelps Dodge Corporation.\n\nKing George IV was among the avid fans of Audubon and subscribed to support publication of the book. London's Royal Society recognized Audubon's achievement by electing him as a fellow. He was the second American to be elected after statesman Benjamin Franklin. While in Edinburgh to seek subscribers for the book, Audubon gave a demonstration of his method of supporting birds with wire at professor Robert Jameson's Wernerian Natural History Association. Student Charles Darwin was in the audience. Audubon also visited the dissecting theatre of the anatomist Robert Knox. Audubon was a hit in France as well, gaining the King and several of the nobility as subscribers.\n\n\"The Birds of America\" became very popular during Europe's Romantic era. Audubon's dramatic portraits of birds appealed to people in this period's fascination with natural history.\n\nAudubon returned to America in 1829 to complete more drawings for his magnum opus. He also hunted animals and shipped the valued skins to British friends. He was reunited with his family. After settling business affairs, Lucy accompanied him back to England. Audubon found that during his absence, he had lost some subscribers due to the uneven quality of coloring of the plates. Others were in arrears in their payments. His engraver fixed the plates and Audubon reassured subscribers, but a few begged off. He responded, \"'The Birds of America' will then raise in value as much as they are now depreciated by certain fools and envious persons.\" He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1830.\n\nHe followed \"The Birds of America\" with a sequel \"Ornithological Biographies\". This was a collection of life histories of each species written with Scottish ornithologist William MacGillivray. The two books were printed separately to avoid a British law requiring copies of all publications with text to be deposited in Crown libraries, a huge financial burden for the self-published Audubon. Both books were published between 1827 and 1839.\n\nDuring the 1830s, Audubon continued making expeditions in North America. During a trip to Key West, a companion wrote in a newspaper article, \"Mr. Audubon is the most enthusiastic and indefatigable man I ever knew ... Mr. Audubon was neither dispirited by heat, fatigue, or bad luck ... he rose every morning at 3 o'clock and went out ... until 1 o'clock.\" Then he would draw the rest of the day before returning to the field in the evening, a routine he kept up for weeks and months. In the posthumously published book, \"The Life of John James Audubon\", edited by his wife and derived primarily from his notes, Audubon related visiting the northeastern Florida coastal sugar plantation of John Joachim Bulow for Christmas 1831/early January 1832. It was started by his father and at 4,675 acres, was the largest in East Florida. Bulow had a sugar mill built there under direction of a Scottish engineer, who accompanied Audubon on an excursion in the region. The mill was destroyed in 1836 in the Seminole Wars. The plantation site is preserved today as the Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park.\n\nIn 1833, Audubon sailed north from Maine, accompanied by his son John, and five other young colleagues, to explore the ornithology of Labrador. On the return voyage, their ship \"Ripley\" made a stop at St. George's, Newfoundland. There Audubon and his assistants documented 36 species of birds.\n\nAudubon painted some of his works while staying at the Key West house and gardens of Capt. John H. Geiger. This site was preserved as the Audubon House and Tropical Gardens.\n\nIn 1841, having finished the \"Ornithological Biographies\", Audubon returned to the United States with his family. He bought an estate on the Hudson River in northern Manhattan. (The roughly 20-acre estate came to be known as Audubon Park in the 1860s when Audubon's widow began selling off parcels of the estate for the development of free-standing single family homes.) Between 1840 and 1844, he published an octavo edition of \"The Birds of America\", with 65 additional plates. Printed in standard format to be more affordable than the oversize British edition, it earned $36,000 and was purchased by 1100 subscribers. Audubon spent much time on \"subscription gathering trips\", drumming up sales of the octavo edition, as he hoped to leave his family a sizable income.\n\nAudubon made some excursions out West where he hoped to record Western species he had missed, but his health began to fail. In 1848, he manifested signs of senility or possibly dementia from what is now called Alzheimer's disease, his \"noble mind in ruins.\" He died at his family home in northern Manhattan on January 27, 1851. Audubon is buried in the graveyard at the Church of the Intercession in the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum at 155th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, near his home. An imposing monument in his honor was erected at the cemetery, which is now recognized as part of the Heritage Rose District of NYC.\n\nAudubon's final work dealt with mammals; he prepared \"The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America\" (1845–1849) in collaboration with his good friend Rev John Bachman of Charleston, South Carolina, who supplied much of the scientific text. His son, John Woodhouse Audubon, drew most of the plates. The work was completed by Audubon's sons, and the second volume was published posthumously in 1851.\n\nAudubon developed his own methods for drawing birds. First, he killed them using fine shot. He then used wires to prop them into a natural position, unlike the common method of many ornithologists, who prepared and stuffed the specimens into a rigid pose. When working on a major specimen like an eagle, he would spend up to four 15-hour days, preparing, studying, and drawing it. His paintings of birds are set true-to-life in their natural habitat. He often portrayed them as if caught in motion, especially feeding or hunting. This was in stark contrast to the stiff representations of birds by his contemporaries, such as Alexander Wilson. Audubon based his paintings on his extensive field observations.\n\nHe worked primarily with watercolor early on. He added colored chalk or pastel to add softness to feathers, especially those of owls and herons. He employed multiple layers of watercoloring, and sometimes used gouache. All species were drawn life size which accounts for the contorted poses of the larger birds as Audubon strove to fit them within the page size. Smaller species were usually placed on branches with berries, fruit, and flowers. He used several birds in a drawing to present all views of anatomy and wings. Larger birds were often placed in their ground habitat or perching on stumps. At times, as with woodpeckers, he combined several species on one page to offer contrasting features. He frequently depicted the birds' nests and eggs, and occasionally natural predators, such as snakes. He usually illustrated male and female variations, and sometimes juveniles. In later drawings, Audubon used assistants to render the habitat for him. In addition to faithful renderings of anatomy, Audubon also employed carefully constructed composition, drama, and slightly exaggerated poses to achieve artistic as well as scientific effects.\n\nAudubon's influence on ornithology and natural history was far reaching. Nearly all later ornithological works were inspired by his artistry and high standards. Charles Darwin quoted Audubon three times in \"On the Origin of Species\" and also in later works. Despite some errors in field observations, he made a significant contribution to the understanding of bird anatomy and behavior through his field notes. \"The Birds of America\" is still considered one of the greatest examples of book art. Audubon discovered 25 new species and 12 new subspecies.\nBULLET::::- He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Linnaean Society, and the Royal Society in recognition of his contributions.\nBULLET::::- The homestead Mill Grove in Audubon, Pennsylvania, is open to the public and contains a museum presenting all his major works, including \"The Birds of America\".\nBULLET::::- The Audubon Museum at John James Audubon State Park in Henderson, Kentucky, houses many of Audubon's original watercolors, oils, engravings and personal memorabilia.\nBULLET::::- In 1905, the National Audubon Society was incorporated and named in his honor.

{"id": "16319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16319", "title": "John Masefield", "text": "John Masefield\n\nJohn Edward Masefield (; 1 June 1878 – 12 May 1967) was an English poet and writer, and the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom from 1930 until 1967. Among his best known works are the children's novels \"The Midnight Folk\" and \"The Box of Delights\", and the poems \"The Everlasting Mercy\" and \"Sea-Fever\".\n\nMasefield was born in Ledbury in Herefordshire, to George Masefield, a solicitor, and his wife Caroline. His mother died giving birth to his sister when Masefield was six and he went to live with his aunt. His father died soon afterwards, following a mental breakdown. After an unhappy education at the King's School in Warwick (now known as Warwick School), where he was a boarder between 1888 and 1891, he left to board , both to train for a life at sea and to break his addiction to reading, of which his aunt thought little. He spent several years aboard this ship, and found that he could spend much of his time reading and writing. It was aboard the \"Conway\" that Masefield's love of story-telling grew. While he was on the ship he listened to the stories told about sea lore, continued to read, and decided that he was to become a writer and story-teller himself.\n\nIn 1894 Masefield boarded the \"Gilcruix\", destined for Chile. This first voyage brought him the experience of sea sickness, but his record of his experiences while sailing through extreme weather shows his delight in seeing flying fish, porpoises and birds. He was awed by the beauty of nature, including a rare sighting of a nocturnal rainbow, on this voyage. On reaching Chile he suffered from sunstroke and was hospitalised. He eventually returned home to England as a passenger aboard a steamship. \n\nIn 1895 Masefield returned to sea on a windjammer destined for New York City. However, the urge to become a writer and the hopelessness of life as a sailor overtook him, and in New York he jumped ship and travelled throughout the countryside. For several months he lived as a vagrant, drifting between odd jobs, before he returned to New York City and found work as a barkeeper's assistant. Some time around Christmas 1895 he read the December edition of \"Truth\", a New York periodical, which contained the poem \"The Piper of Arll\" by Duncan Campbell Scott. Ten years later Masefield wrote to Scott to tell him what reading that poem had meant to him:\n\nFor the next two years Masefield was employed at the huge Alexander Smith carpet factory in Yonkers, New York, where long hours were expected and conditions were far from ideal. He purchased up to 20 books a week, and devoured both modern and classical literature. His interests at this time were diverse, and his reading included works by George du Maurier, Dumas, Thomas Browne, Hazlitt, Dickens, Kipling, and R. L. Stevenson. Chaucer also became very important to him during this time, as well as Keats and Shelley. Masefield returned home to England in 1897 as a passenger aboard a steamship.\n\nWhen Masefield was 23 he met his future wife, Constance de la Cherois Crommelin, who was 35 and of Huguenot descent. Educated in classics and English Literature, and a mathematics teacher, Constance was a good match for him, despite the difference in their ages. The couple had two children, Judith, born in 1904, and Lewis, born in 1910. \n\nIn 1902 Masefield was put in charge of the fine art section of the Arts and Industrial Exhibition in Wolverhampton. By then his poems were being published in periodicals and his first collection of verse, \"Salt-Water Ballads\", was published that year. It included the poem \"Sea-Fever\". Masefield then wrote two novels, \"Captain Margaret\" (1908) and \"Multitude and Solitude\" (1909). In 1911, after a long period of writing no poems, he composed \"The Everlasting Mercy\", the first of his narrative poems, and within the next year had produced two more, \"The Widow in the Bye Street\" and \"Dauber\". As a result, he became widely known to the public and was praised by the critics. In 1912 he was awarded the annual Edmond de Polignac Prize.\n\nWhen the First World War began in 1914 Masefield was old enough to be exempted from military service, but he joined the staff of a British hospital for French soldiers, the Hôpital Temporaire d'Arc-en-Barrois in Haute-Marne, serving briefly in 1915 as a hospital orderly. He later published an account of his experiences. At about this time Masefield moved his country retreat from Buckinghamshire to Lollingdon Farm in Cholsey, Berkshire, a setting that inspired a number of poems and sonnets under the title \"Lollingdon Downs\", and which his family used until 1917.\n\nAfter returning home Masefield was invited to the United States on a three-month lecture tour. Although his primary purpose was to lecture on English literature, he also intended to collect information on the mood and views of Americans regarding the war in Europe. When he returned to England he submitted a report to the British Foreign Office and suggested that he should be allowed to write a book about the failure of the Allied effort in the Dardanelles that might be used in the United States to counter German propaganda there. The resulting work, \"Gallipoli\", was a success. Masefield then met the head of British Military Intelligence in France and was asked to write an account of the Battle of the Somme. Although Masefield had grand ideas for his book, he was denied access to official records and what was intended to be the preface was published as \"The Old Front Line\", a description of the geography of the Somme area.\n\nIn 1918 Masefield returned to America on his second lecture tour, spending much of his time speaking and lecturing to American soldiers waiting to be sent to Europe. These speaking engagements were very successful. On one occasion a battalion of black soldiers danced and sang for him after his lecture. During this tour he matured as a public speaker and realised his ability to touch the emotions of his audience with his style of speaking, learning to speak publicly from his own heart rather than from dry scripted speeches. Towards the end of his visit both Yale and Harvard Universities conferred honorary doctorates of letters on him.\nMasefield entered the 1920s as an accomplished and respected writer. His family was able to settle on Boar's Hill, a somewhat rural setting not far from Oxford, where Masefield took up beekeeping, goat-herding and poultry-keeping. He continued to meet with success: the first edition of his \"Collected Poems\" (1923) sold about 80,000 copies. A narrative poem, \"Reynard The Fox\" (1920), has been critically compared with works by Geoffrey Chaucer, not necessarily to Masefield's credit. This was followed by \"Right Royal\" and \"King Cole\", poems in which the relationship between humanity and nature is emphasised. \n\nAfter \"King Cole\", Masefield turned away from long poems and back to novels. Between 1924 and 1939 he published 12 novels, which vary from stories of the sea (\"The Bird of Dawning\", \"Victorious Troy\") to social novels about modern England (\"The Hawbucks\", \"The Square Peg\"), and from tales of an imaginary land in Central America (\"Sard Harker\", \"Odtaa\") to fantasies for children (\"The Midnight Folk\", \"The Box of Delights\"). In this same period he wrote a large number of dramatic pieces. Most of these were based on Christian themes, and Masefield, to his amazement, encountered a ban on the performance of plays on biblical subjects that went back to the Reformation and had been revived a generation earlier to prevent production of Oscar Wilde's Salome. However, a compromise was reached and in 1928 his \"The Coming of Christ\" was the first play to be performed in an English cathedral since the Middle Ages.\n\nIn 1921 Masefield received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Oxford. In 1923 he organised Oxford Recitations, an annual contest whose purpose was \"to discover good speakers of verse and to encourage 'the beautiful speaking of poetry'.\" Given the numbers of contest applicants, the event's promotion of natural speech in poetical recitations, and the number of people learning how to listen to poetry, Oxford Recitations was generally deemed a success. Masefield was similarly a founding member, in 1924, of the Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse. He later came to question whether the Oxford events should continue as a contest, considering that they might better be run as a festival. However, in 1929, after he broke with the competitive element, Oxford Recitations came to an end. The Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse, on the other hand, continued to develop through the influence of associated figures such as Marion Angus and Hugh MacDiarmid and exists today as the Poetry Association of Scotland.\n\nIn 1930, on the death of Robert Bridges, a new Poet Laureate was needed. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, King George V appointed Masefield, who remained in the post until his death in 1967. The only person to hold the office for a longer period was Alfred, Lord Tennyson. On his appointment \"The Times\" wrote of him: \"his poetry could touch to beauty the plain speech of everyday life\". Masefield took his appointment seriously and produced a large quantity of poems for royal occasions, which were sent to \"The Times\" for publication. Masefield's modesty was shown by his inclusion of a stamped and self-addressed envelope with each submission so that the poem could be returned if it was found unacceptable. Later he was commissioned to write a poem to be set to music by the Master of the King's Musick, Sir Edward Elgar, and performed at the unveiling of the Queen Alexandra Memorial by the King on 8 June 1932. This was the ode \"So many true Princesses who have gone\".\n\nAfter his appointment Masefield was awarded the Order of Merit by King George V and many honorary degrees from British universities. In 1937 he was elected President of the Society of Authors. Masefield encouraged the continued development of English literature and poetry, and began the annual awarding of the Royal Medals for Poetry for a first or second published edition of poems by a poet under the age of 35. Additionally, his speaking engagements called him further away, often on much longer tours, yet he still produced significant amounts of work in a wide variety of genres. To those he had already used he now added autobiography, producing \"New Chum\", \"In the Mill\", and \"So Long to Learn\". \n\nIt was not until he was about 70 that Masefield slowed his pace, mainly due to illness. In 1960 Constance died aged 93, after a long illness. Although her death was heartrending, he had spent a tiring year watching the woman he loved die. He continued his duties as Poet Laureate. \"In Glad Thanksgiving\", his last book, was published when he was 88 years old. \n\nIn late 1966 Masefield developed gangrene in his ankle. This spread to his leg and he died of the infection on 12 May 1967. In accordance with his stated wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were placed in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. However, the following verse by Masefield was discovered later, addressed to his \"Heirs, Administrators, and Assigns\":\n\nThe Masefield Centre at Warwick School, which Masefield attended, and John Masefield High School in Ledbury, Herefordshire, have been named in his honour. In 1977 Folkways Records released an album of readings of some of his poems, including some read by Masefield himself.\n\nIn addition to the commission for Queen Alexandra's Memorial Ode with music by Elgar, many of Masefield's short poems were set as art songs by British composers of the time. Best known by far is John Ireland's \"Sea-Fever\". Frederick Keel composed several songs drawn from the \"Salt-Water Ballads\" and elsewhere. Of these, \"Trade Winds\" was particularly popular in its day, despite the tongue-twisting challenges the text presents to the singer. Keel's defiant setting of \"Tomorrow\", written while interned at Ruhleben during World War I, was frequently programmed at the BBC Proms after the war. Another memorable wartime composition is Ivor Gurney's climactic declamation of \"By a bierside\", a setting quickly set down in 1916 during a brief spell behind the lines.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Salt-Water Ballads\" (1902)\nBULLET::::- \"Ballads\" (1903)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Ballads and Poems\" (1910)\n\"The Everlasting Mercy\" (1911)\nBULLET::::- \"The Widow in the Bye Street\" (1912)\nBULLET::::- \"Dauber: A Poem (1912)\nBULLET::::- \"The Story of a Round-House and Other Poems\" (1912)\nBULLET::::- \"The Daffodil Fields\" (1913)\nBULLET::::- \"Philip the King and Other Poems\" (1914)\nBULLET::::- \"Salt-Water Poems and Ballads\" (1916)\nSonnets (1916)\nBULLET::::- \"Sonnets and Poems\" (1916)\nBULLET::::- \"Lollingdon Downs and Other Poems with Sonnets\" (1917)\nBULLET::::- \"Rosas\" (1918)\n\nA Poem [Rosas] and Two Plays (1919)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Reynard the Fox: or the Ghost Heath Run\" (1919)\n\nAnimula [Limited to 250 copies] (1920)\nBULLET::::- \"Enslaved and Other Poems\" (1920)\nRight Royal (1920)\nBULLET::::- \"King Cole\" (1921)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Selected Poems\" (1922)\nBULLET::::- \"The Dream\" [Illustrations by Judith Masefield, Limited Edition] (1922)\nBULLET::::- \"King Cole and Other Poems\" (1923)\nBULLET::::- \"The Collected Poems of John Masefield\" (1923)\nBULLET::::- \"Poems\" (1925)\nSonnets of Good Cheer to The Lena Ashwell Players (1926)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Midsummer Night and Other Tales in Verse\" (1928)\nSouth and East [Illustated by Jacynth Parsons, Limited to 2,750] (1929)\n\nMinnie Maylow’s Story and Other Tales and Scenes (1931)\n\nA Tale of Troy (1932)\nBULLET::::- \"A Letter from Pontus and Other Verse\" (1936)\nBULLET::::- \"The Country Scene (With Pictures by Edward Seago) (1937)\nTribute to Ballet (With Pictures by Edward Seago) (1938)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Some Verses to Some Germans\" [10 Page Pamphlet] (1939)\n\nGautama the Enlightened and Other Verse (1941)\n\nNatalie Maisie and Pavilastukay (1942)\n\nLand Workers [11 page Pamphlet] (1942)\n\nA Generation Risen [Illustrations by Edward Seago] (1943)\n\nWonderings (Between One and Six Years) (1943)\n\nThe Bullying of the Badger (1949)\n\nOn the Hill (1949)\n\nThe Story of Ossian [Long-playing record only] (1959)\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Bluebells and Other Verses\" (1961)\nBULLET::::- \"Old Raiger and Other Verses\" (1964)\nBULLET::::- \"In Glad Thanksgiving\" (1966)\n\nBULLET::::- \"A Mainsail Haul\" (1905)\nBULLET::::- \"A Tarpaulin Muster\" (short stories) (1907)\nBULLET::::- \"Captain Margaret\" (1908)\nBULLET::::- \"Multitude and Solitude\" (1909)\nBULLET::::- \"Martin Hyde: The Duke's Messenger\" (1909)\nBULLET::::- \"Lost Endeavour\" (Nelson, 1910).\nBULLET::::- \"A Book of Discoveries\" (children's novel) (1910)\nBULLET::::- \"The Street of Today\" (1911)\nBULLET::::- \"Jim Davis\" (Wells Gardner, 1911).\nBULLET::::- \"Sard Harker\" (Heinemann, 1924)\nBULLET::::- \"ODTAA\" (1926)\nBULLET::::- \"The Midnight Folk\" (children's novel) (1927)\nBULLET::::- \"The Hawbucks\" (1929)\nBULLET::::- \"The Bird of Dawning\" (Heinemann, 1933).\nBULLET::::- \"The Taking of the Gry\" (1934)\nBULLET::::- \"The Box of Delights: or When the Wolves Were Running\" (children's novel) (1935)\nBULLET::::- \"Victorious Troy: or The Harrying Angel\" (1935)\nBULLET::::- \"Eggs and Baker\" (1936)\nBULLET::::- \"The Square Peg: or The Gun Fella\" (1937)\nBULLET::::- \"Dead Ned\" (1938)\nBULLET::::- \"Live and Kicking Ned\" (1939)\nBULLET::::- \"Basilissa: A Tale of the Empress Theodora\" (1940)\nBULLET::::- \"Conquer: A Tale of the Nika Rebellion in Byzantium\" (1941)\nBULLET::::- \"Badon Parchments\" (1947)\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Campden Wonder\" (1907)\nBULLET::::- \"The Tragedy of Pompey the Great\" (1910)\nBULLET::::- \"Philip the King\" (1914)\nBULLET::::- \"Good Friday: A Play in Verse\" (1916)\nBULLET::::- \"The Tragedy of Nan\" (Originally known as \"Nan\")\nA King’s Daughter: A Tragedy in Verse (1923)\nBULLET::::- \"The Witch\" (1926) (trans. from the Norwegian play \"Anne Pedersdotter\" by Hans Wiers-Jenssen)\nBULLET::::- \"Tristan and Isolt: A Play in Verse (1927)\nBULLET::::- \"The Coming of Christ\" (1928)\nEaster: A Play for Singers (1929)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Sea Life in Nelson's Time\" (1905)\nBULLET::::- \"Gallipoli\" (1916)\nBULLET::::- \"The Old Front Line\" (1917)\nBULLET::::- \"The Battle of the Somme\" (1919)\nBULLET::::- \"The Wanderer of Liverpool\" (1930)\nBULLET::::- \"Recent Prose\" (1924)\nBULLET::::- \"Poetry: a Lecture Given at the Queen's Hall in London on Thursday, October 15th, 1931\"\nBULLET::::- \"The Conway: From Her Foundation to the Present Day\" (1933)\nSome Memories of W.

{"id": "16321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16321", "title": "Joseph McCarthy", "text": "Joseph McCarthy\n\nJoseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 – May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the United States in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread Communist subversion. He is known for alleging that numerous Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government, universities, film industry , and elsewhere. Ultimately, the smear tactics that he used led him to be censured by the U.S. Senate. The term \"McCarthyism\", coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Today, the term is used more broadly to mean demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents.\n\nIn his book \"The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI\", journalist Ronald Kessler quoted former FBI agent Robert J. Lamphere, who participated in all the FBI's major spy cases during the McCarthy period, as saying that FBI agents who worked counterintelligence were aghast that FBI Director J. Hoover initially supported McCarthy.\n“McCarthyism did all kinds of harm because he was pushing something that wasn’t so,” Lamphere told Kessler. The VENONA intercepts showed that over several decades, “There were a lot of spies in the government, but not all in the State Department,” Lamphere said. However, “The problem was that McCarthy lied about his information and figures. He made charges against people that weren’t true. McCarthyism harmed the counterintelligence effort against the Soviet threat because of the revulsion it caused. All along, Hoover was helping him.”\n\nBorn in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, McCarthy commissioned in to the Marine Corps in 1942, where he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron. Following the end of World War II, he attained the rank of major. He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer, acquiring the nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\". Some of his claims of heroism were later shown to be exaggerated or falsified, leading many of his critics to use \"Tail-Gunner Joe\" as a term of mockery.\n\nMcCarthy successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1946, defeating Robert M. La Follette Jr. After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate, McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of \"members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring\" who were employed in the State Department. In succeeding years after his 1950 speech, McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department, the administration of President Harry S. Truman, the Voice of America, and the U.S. Army. He also used various charges of communism, communist sympathies, disloyalty, or sex crimes to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government. This included a concurrent \"Lavender Scare\" against suspected homosexuals (as homosexuality was prohibited by law at the time, it was also perceived to increase a person's risk for blackmail). Former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson has written: \"The so-called 'Red Scare' has been the main focus of most historians of that period of time. A lesser-known element ... and one that harmed far more people was the witch-hunt McCarthy and others conducted against homosexuals\".\n\nWith the highly publicized Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954, and following the suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester C. Hunt that same year, McCarthy's support and popularity faded. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to censure Senator McCarthy by a vote of 67–22, making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion. He continued to speak against communism and socialism until his death at the age of 48 at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on May 2, 1957. His death certificate listed the cause of death as \"Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown\". Doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition. Some biographers say this was caused or exacerbated by alcoholism.\n\nMcCarthy was born in 1908 on a farm in the town of Grand Chute in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, the fifth of seven children. His mother, Bridget (Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and graduated in one year.\n\nHe attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. McCarthy worked his way through college, studying first electrical engineering for two years, then law, and receiving an LL.B. degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.\n\nMcCarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935. While working at a law firm in Shawano, Wisconsin, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a Democrat in 1936. During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.\n\nIn 1939, McCarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th District circuit judge. McCarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the state's history by defeating incumbent Edgar V. Werner, who had been a judge for 24 years. In the campaign, McCarthy exaggerated Werner's age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office. Writing of Werner in \"Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America,\" Ted Morgan wrote: \"Pompous and condescending, he (Werner) was disliked by lawyers. He had been reversed often by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases.\"\n\nMcCarthy's judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited from Werner. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.\n\nIn 1942, shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, McCarthy joined the United States Marine Corps, despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from military service. His college education qualified him for a direct commission, and he entered the Marines as a first lieutenant.\n\nAccording to Morgan, writing in \"Reds\", McCarthy's friend and campaign manager, attorney and judge Urban P. Van Susteren, had applied for active duty in the U.S. Army Air Forces in early 1942, and advised McCarthy: \"Be a hero—join the Marines.\" When McCarthy seemed hesitant, Van Susteren asked, \"You got shit in your blood?\"\n\nHe served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville for 30 months (August 1942 – February 1945), and held the rank of captain by the time he resigned his commission in April 1945. He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer, acquiring (or perhaps giving himself) the nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\". McCarthy remained in the Marine Corps Reserve after the war, attaining the rank of major.\n\nHe later falsely claimed participation in 32 aerial missions in order to qualify for a Distinguished Flying Cross and multiple awards of the Air Medal, which the Marine Corps chain of command decided to approve in 1952 because of his political influence. McCarthy also publicized a letter of commendation which he claimed had been signed by his commanding officer and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, then Chief of Naval Operations. However, his commander revealed that McCarthy had written this letter himself, probably while preparing award citations and commendation letters as an additional duty, and that he signed his commander's name, after which Nimitz signed it in the process of signing numerous other such letters. A \"war wound\"—a badly broken leg—that McCarthy made the subject of varying stories involving airplane crashes or anti-aircraft fire had in fact happened aboard ship during a raucous celebration for sailors crossing the equator for the first time. Because of McCarthy's various lies about his military heroism, his \"Tail-Gunner Joe\" nickname was sarcastically used as a term of mockery by his critics.\n\nMcCarthy campaigned for the Republican Senate nomination in Wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated by Alexander Wiley, the incumbent. After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator Robert M. La Follette Jr., founder of the Wisconsin Progressive Party and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator Robert M. La Follette Sr.\n\nIn his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery. La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.\n\nAccording to Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May, McCarthy's campaign funds, much of them from out of state, were ten times more than La Follette's and McCarthy's vote benefited from a Communist Party vendetta against La Follette. The suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging, and McCarthy won the primary nomination 207,935 votes to 202,557. It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\", using the slogan, \"Congress needs a tail-gunner\". Arnold Beichman later stated that McCarthy \"was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist-controlled United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO\", which preferred McCarthy to the anti-communist Robert M. La Follette.\nIn the general election against Democratic opponent Howard J. McMurray, McCarthy won 61.2% to Democrat McMurray's 37.3%, and thus joined Senator Wiley, whom he had challenged unsuccessfully two years earlier, in the Senate.\n\nSenator McCarthy's first three years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many different organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.\n\nHe was active in labor-management issues, with a reputation as a moderate Republican. He fought against continuation of wartime price controls, especially on sugar. His advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a $20,000 personal loan McCarthy received from a Pepsi bottling executive, earning the Senator the derisive nickname \"The Pepsi-Cola Kid\".\nHe supported the Taft–Hartley Act over Truman's veto, angering labor unions in Wisconsin but solidifying his business base.\n\nIn an incident for which he would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.\nShortly after this, a poll of the Senate press corps voted McCarthy \"the worst U.S. senator\" currently in office.\n\nMcCarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, when he gave a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are a matter of some debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: \"The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.\"\n\nThere is some dispute about whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being \"205\" or \"57\". In a later telegram to President Truman, and when entering the speech into the Congressional Record, he used the number 57.\nThe origin of the number 205 can be traced: in later debates on the Senate floor, McCarthy referred to a 1946 letter that then–Secretary of State James Byrnes sent to Congressman Adolph J. Sabath. In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll. In fact, by the time of McCarthy's speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the Byrnes letter were still with the State Department, and all of these had undergone further security checks.\n\nAt the time of McCarthy's speech, communism was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated by the actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.\n\nMcCarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the Wheeling speech, and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and figures. In Salt Lake City, Utah, a few days later, he cited a figure of 57, and in the Senate on February 20, 1950, he claimed 81. During a five-hour speech, McCarthy presented a case-by-case analysis of his 81 \"loyalty risks\" employed at the State Department. It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were selected from the so-called \"Lee list\", a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent named Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were \"incidents of inefficiencies\"\nin the security reviews of 108 employees. McCarthy hid the source of his list, stating that he had penetrated the \"iron curtain\" of State Department secrecy with the aid of \"some good, loyal Americans in the State Department\". In reciting the information from the Lee list cases, McCarthy consistently exaggerated, representing the hearsay of witnesses as facts and converting phrases such as \"inclined towards Communism\" to \"a Communist\".\nIn response to McCarthy's charges, the Senate voted unanimously to investigate, and the Tydings Committee hearings were called. This was a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations set up in February 1950 to conduct \"a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State\".\nMany Democrats were incensed at McCarthy's attack on the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him. The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Millard Tydings, was reported to have said, \"Let me have him [McCarthy] for three days in public hearings, and he'll never show his face in the Senate again.\"\n\nDuring the hearings, McCarthy moved on from his original unnamed Lee list cases and used the hearings to make charges against nine specific people: Dorothy Kenyon, Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, Gustavo Durán, Owen Lattimore, Harlow Shapley, Frederick Schuman, John S. Service, and Philip Jessup. Some of them no longer worked for the State Department, or never had; all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a \"top Russian spy\". Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax\", and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\". Republicans responded in kind, with William E. Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of \"the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history\".\nThe full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report, and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines.\n\nFrom 1950 onward, McCarthy continued to exploit the fear of Communism and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into the numerous homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.\n\n\"In Congress, there was little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in sensitive government positions.\" Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold. In the opinion of one writer, \"Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail.\" DCI Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, \"The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years.\" As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take the remainder of the DCI's testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: \"While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if Josef Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations ... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business.\" The senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.\n\nMcCarthy's methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many. Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by \"Washington Post\" cartoonist Herbert Block. Block and others used the word as a synonym for demagoguery, baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled \"McCarthyism: The Fight For America.\"\n\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for John Marshall Butler in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors.\" McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader Earl Russell Browder.\nA Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign,\" as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate. The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite. McCarthy said it was \"wrong\" to distribute it; though staffer Jean Kerr thought it was fine. After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.\n\nIn addition to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.\nIn the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54.2% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild's 45.6%.\n\nIn 1950 McCarthy assaulted journalist Drew Pearson in the cloakroom of a Washington club, reportedly kneeing him in the groin. McCarthy, who admitted the assault, claimed he merely \"slapped\" Pearson. In 1952, using rumors collected by Pearson, Nevada publisher Hank Greenspun wrote that McCarthy was a homosexual. The major journalistic media refused to print the story, and no notable McCarthy biographer has accepted the rumor as probable. In 1953, McCarthy married Jean Fraser Kerr, a researcher in his office. In January 1957 McCarthy and his wife adopted a baby girl, whom they named Tierney Elizabeth McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' \"twenty years of treason\". Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as \"the best asset the Kremlin has\", calling McCarthy's actions an attempt to \"sabotage the foreign policy of the United States\" in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.\nIt was the Truman Administration's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) \"known Communists\". Truman's Secretary of Defense, George Catlett Marshall, was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman's former Secretary of State. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled \"America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall\". Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;\ndeclared that \"if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country's interest\"; and most famously, accused him of being part of \"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man\".\n\nDuring the Korean War, when President Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur, McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late-night sessions when \"they've had time to get the President cheerful\" on bourbon and Bénédictine. McCarthy declared, \"The son of a bitch should be impeached.\"\n\nOne of the strongest bases of anti-Communist sentiment in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the great majority of Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.\nAt the same time, some Catholics did oppose McCarthy, notably the anti-Communist author Father John Francis Cronin and the influential journal \"Commonweal\".\n\nMcCarthy established a bond with the powerful Kennedy family, which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became a close friend of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, Patricia and Eunice. It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy's first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim has been acknowledged by Robert's wife and Kathleen's mother Ethel, though Kathleen later claimed that she looked at her christening certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.\n\nRobert Kennedy was chosen by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee, but resigned after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Marcus Cohn. Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped that one of his sons would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.\n\nUnlike many Democrats, John F. Kennedy, who served in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter's death in 1957, never attacked McCarthy. McCarthy had refused to campaign for Kennedy's 1952 opponent, Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., due to his friendship with the Kennedys. When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad McCarthy had not attended Harvard College, an angry Kennedy jumped up, denounced the speaker, and left the event. Asked by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. why he avoided criticism of McCarthy, Kennedy said, \"Hell, half my voters in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero.\"\n\nDuring the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for \"The New York Times,\" and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.\n\nWith his victory in the 1952 presidential race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that \"Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal. ... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'\"\n\nMcCarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54% of the vote, defeating former Wisconsin State Attorney General Thomas E. Fairchild but, as stated above, badly trailing a Republican ticket which otherwise swept the state of Wisconsin; all the other Republican winners, including Eisenhower himself, received at least 60% of the Wisconsin vote.\nThose who expected that party loyalty would cause McCarthy to tone down his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed. Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy, and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office. In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were ... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that John Paton Davies Jr. was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the Central Intelligence Agency.\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War. By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-\"one\" years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.\n\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly. Eisenhower refused, saying privately \"nothing would please him [McCarthy] more than to get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the President.\" On several occasions Eisenhower is reported to have said of McCarthy that he did not want to \"get down in the gutter with that guy.\"\n\nWith the beginning of his second term as senator in 1953, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the Internal Security Subcommittee—the committee normally involved with investigating Communists—thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm,\" in the words of Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft. However, the Committee on Government Operations included the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed Roy Cohn as chief counsel and 27-year-old Robert F. Kennedy as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Cohn brought with him, as his assistant, Gerald David Schine, heir to a hotel-chain fortune, who would bear much responsibility for triggering McCarthy's eventual downfall.\n\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003–04, Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\n\nSenator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings. ... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.\n\nThe subcommittee first investigated allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America, at that time administered by the State Department's United States Information Agency. Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations. A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"\n\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as burning the newly forbidden books. Shortly after this, in one of his public criticisms of McCarthy, President Eisenhower urged Americans: \"Don't join the book burners. ... Don't be afraid to go in your library and read every book.\"\n\nSoon after receiving the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed J. B. Matthews as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un-American Activities Committee. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\", which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.\n\nIn autumn 1953, McCarthy's committee began its ill-fated inquiry into the United States Army. This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations. Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress, a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment. McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army, Robert T. Stevens, demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.\n\nEarly in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, of improperly pressuring the army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, a former aide to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the army as a private. McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.\nThe army consulted with an attorney familiar with McCarthy to determine the best approach to attacking him. Based on his recommendation, it decided not to pursue McCarthy on the issue of communists in government: \"The attorney feels it is almost impossible to counter McCarthy effectively on the issue of kicking Communists out of Government, because he generally has some basis, no matter how slight, for his claim of Communist connection.\"\n\nThe hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on live television by ABC and DuMont, with an estimated 20 million viewers. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".\n\nOf far greater importance to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.\nLate in the hearings, Senator Stuart Symington made an angry and prophetic remark to McCarthy, upon being told by McCarthy that \"You're not fooling anyone\": \"Senator, the American people have had a look at you now for six weeks; you're not fooling anyone, either.\"\nIn Gallup polls of January 1954, 50% of those polled had a positive opinion of McCarthy. In June, that number had fallen to 34%. In the same polls, those with a negative opinion of McCarthy increased from 29% to 45%.\n\nAn increasing number of Republicans and conservatives were coming to see McCarthy as a liability to the party and to anti-communism. Congressman George H. Bender noted, \"There is a growing impatience with the Republican Party. McCarthyism has become a synonym for witch-hunting, Star Chamber methods, and the denial of ... civil liberties.\" Frederick Woltman, a reporter with a long-standing reputation as a staunch anti-communist, wrote a five-part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the \"New York World-Telegram.\" He stated that McCarthy \"has become a major liability to the cause of anti-communism\", and accused him of \"wild twisting of facts and near facts [that] repels authorities in the field\".\nThe most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army's chief legal representative, Joseph Nye Welch. On June 9, the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy's list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants \"before the sun goes down\". McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on a man in his Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive lawyers association.\nIn an impassioned defense of Fisher, Welch responded, \"Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness ...\" When McCarthy resumed his attack, Welch interrupted him: \"Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?\" When McCarthy once again persisted, Welch cut him off and demanded the chairman \"call the next witness\". At that point, the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called.\nEven before Welch asked McCarthy, \"Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?\" in the hearings, one of the most prominent attacks on McCarthy's methods was an episode of the television documentary series \"See It Now\", hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled \"A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy\", the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of \"twenty years of treason\", describes the American Civil Liberties Union as \"listed as 'a front for, and doing the work of', the Communist Party\", and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.\n\nIn his conclusion, Murrow said of McCarthy:\n\nThe following week, \"See It Now\" ran another episode critical of McCarthy, this one focusing on the case of Annie Lee Moss, an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy's investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy, in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on \"See It Now\" on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with VOKS, the \"Russian espionage and propaganda organization\". This response did not go over well with viewers, and the result was a further decline in McCarthy's popularity.\nAccording to Arthur Herman, popular historian and senior fellow of the conservative Hudson Institute, Murrow's staff edited the film to show McCarthy behaving in an unflattering way. Herman quotes John Cogley of \"Commonweal\", a McCarthy critic, as stating, \"A totally different selection of film would turn McCarthy into a man on a shining white steed—infinitely reasonable, burdened with the onus of single-handedly cleaning out subversives in the face of violent criticism\" and that Murrow used \"partial truth and innuendo\".\n\nOn March 18, 1954 \"Sauk-Prairie Star\" editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin urged the recall of McCarthy in a front-page editorial that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower's authority, disrespecting Wisconsin's own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.\n\nDespite critics' claims that a recall attempt was foolhardy, the \"Joe Must Go\" movement caught fire and was backed by a diverse coalition including other Republican leaders, Democrats, businessmen, farmers and students. Wisconsin's constitution stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from organized labor or the state Democratic Party, the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.\n\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the Sauk County district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 were said to be hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.\n\n+ McCarthy's Support in Gallup Polls\n!

Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, delivered her \"Declaration of Conscience\" on June 1, 1950, calling for an end to the use of smear tactics without mentioning McCarthy or anyone else by name. Six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—joined her in condemning McCarthy's tactics. McCarthy referred to Smith and her fellow senators as \"Snow White and the six dwarfs\".\n\nOn March 9, 1954, Vermont Republican senator Ralph E. Flanders gave a humor-laced speech on the Senate floor, questioning McCarthy's tactics in fighting communism, likening McCarthyism to \"housecleaning\" with \"much clatter and hullabaloo\". He recommended that McCarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of Communism outside North America.\nIn a June 1 speech, Flanders compared McCarthy to Adolf Hitler, accusing him of spreading \"division and confusion\" and saying, \"Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them.\"\nOn June 11, Flanders introduced a resolution to have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees. Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to censure McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins, was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.\n\nAfter two months of hearings and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy's conduct was arguably \"induced\" by Zwicker's own behavior. In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy's statements about the Watkins Committee itself.\n\nThe two counts on which the Senate ultimately voted were:\nBULLET::::- That McCarthy had \"failed to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration\", and \"repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties ...\"\nBULLET::::- That McCarthy had charged \"three members of the [Watkins] Select Committee with 'deliberate deception' and 'fraud' ... that the special Senate session ... was a 'lynch party, and had characterized the committee \"as the 'unwitting handmaiden', 'involuntary agent' and 'attorneys in fact' of the Communist Party\", and had \"acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute, to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate, and to impair its dignity\".\n\nOn December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to \"condemn\" McCarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22. The Democrats present unanimously favored condemnation and the Republicans were split evenly. The only senator not on record was John F. Kennedy, who was hospitalized for back surgery; Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted. Immediately after the vote, Senator H. Styles Bridges, a McCarthy supporter, argued that the resolution was \"not a censure resolution\" because the word \"condemn\" rather than \"censure\" was used in the final draft. The word \"censure\" was then removed from the title of the resolution, though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of McCarthy, both by historians\nand in Senate documents. McCarthy himself said, \"I wouldn't exactly call it a vote of confidence.\" He added, \"I don't feel I've been lynched.\"\nBut Indiana Senator William E. Jenner, one of McCarthy's friends and fellow Republicans, likened McCarthy's conduct to that of \"the kid who came to the party and peed in the lemonade.\"\n\nAfter his condemnation and censure, Joseph McCarthy continued senatorial duties for another two and a half years. But his career as a major public figure had been irreparably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate obviously avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with intentional and conspicuous displays of inattention.\nThe press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him, and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing. President Eisenhower, finally freed of McCarthy's political intimidation, quipped to his Cabinet that McCarthyism was now \"McCarthywasm\".\n\nStill, McCarthy continued to rail against Communism. He warned against attendance at summit conferences with \"the Reds\", saying that \"you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers ... without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder.\"\nHe declared that \"coexistence with Communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable. Our long-term objective must be the eradication of Communism from the face of the earth.\" In one of his final acts in the Senate, McCarthy opposed President Eisenhower's nomination to the Supreme Court of William J. Brennan, after reading a speech Brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized McCarthy's anti-Communist investigations as \"witch hunts\". McCarthy's opposition failed to gain any traction, however, and he was the only senator to vote against Brennan's confirmation.\n\nMcCarthy's biographers agree that he was a changed man after the censure; declining both physically and emotionally, he became a \"pale ghost of his former self\" in the words of Fred J. Cook.\nIt was reported that McCarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcoholism.\nNumerous eyewitnesses, including Senate aide George Reedy and journalist Tom Wicker, reported finding him alarmingly drunk in the Senate.\nJournalist Richard Rovere (1959) wrote:\n\nHe had always been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The difficulty toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.\n\nMcCarthy had also become addicted to morphine. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy's addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused. In Anslinger's memoir, \"The Murderers\", McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:\n\nI wouldn't try to do anything about it, Commissioner ... It will be the worse for you ... and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn't care [. . .] The choice is yours.\n\nAnslinger decided to give McCarthy access to morphine in secret from a pharmacy in Washington, DC. The morphine was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, right up to McCarthy's death. Anslinger never publicly named McCarthy, and he threatened, with prison, a journalist who uncovered the story. However, McCarthy's identity was known to Anslinger's agents, and journalist Maxine Cheshire confirmed his identity with Will Oursler, co-author of \"The Murderers\", in 1978.\n\nMcCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on Thursday, May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as \"Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown\"; doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism, an estimation that is now accepted by modern biographers. He was given a state funeral attended by 70 senators, and a Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass was celebrated before more than 100 priests and 2,000 others at Washington's St. Matthew's Cathedral. Thousands of people viewed the body in Washington. He was buried in St. Mary's Parish Cemetery, Appleton, Wisconsin, where more than 17,000 filed through St. Mary's Church to pay their last respects. Three senators—George W. Malone, William E. Jenner, and Herman Welker—had flown from Washington to Appleton on the plane carrying McCarthy's casket. Robert F. Kennedy quietly attended the funeral in Wisconsin. McCarthy was survived by his wife, Jean, and their adopted daughter, Tierney.\n\nIn the summer of 1957, a special election was held to fill McCarthy's seat. In the primaries, voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy's legacy. The Republican primary was won by Walter J. Kohler Jr., who called for a clean break from McCarthy's approach; he defeated former Congressman Glenn Robert Davis, who charged that Eisenhower was soft on Communism. The Democratic candidate, William Proxmire, called the late McCarthy \"a disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate, and to America\". On August 27, Proxmire won the election, serving in the seat for 32 years.\n\nWilliam Bennett, former Reagan Administration Secretary of Education, summed up his perspective in his 2007 book \"America: The Last Best Hope\":\n\nMcCarthy remains a controversial figure. Some scholars assert that new evidence—in the form of Venona-decrypted Soviet messages, Soviet espionage data now opened to the West, and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy's subcommittee—has partially vindicated McCarthy by showing that some of his identifications of Communists were correct and that the scale of Soviet espionage activity in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars suspected. After reviewing evidence from Venona and other sources, historian John Earl Haynes concluded that, of 159 people identified on lists used or referenced by McCarthy, evidence was substantial that nine had aided Soviet espionage efforts. \n\nAmong those implicated in files later made public from the Venona project and Soviet sources were Cedric Belfrage, Frank Coe, Lauchlin Currie, Harold Glasser, David Karr, Mary Jane Keeney, and Leonard Mins.\n\nThese viewpoints are considered by historian David Oshinsky to be fringe revisionist history. Challenging efforts aimed at the \"rehabilitation\" of McCarthy, Haynes argues that McCarthy's attempts to \"make anti-communism a partisan weapon\" actually \"threatened [the post-War] anti-Communist consensus\", thereby ultimately harming anti-Communist efforts more than helping.\n\nDiplomat George F. Kennan drew on his State Department experience to provide his view that \"The penetration of the American governmental services by members or agents (conscious or otherwise) of the American Communist Party in the late 1930s was not a figment of the imagination ... it really existed; and it assumed proportions which, while never overwhelming, were also not trivial.\" Kennan wrote that under the Roosevelt administration \"warnings which should have been heeded fell too often on deaf or incredulous ears.\"\nHowever, conservative writers have argued that evidence from the Venona documents shows greater penetration by Soviet agents.\n\nMcCarthy's hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). HUAC is best known for the investigation of Alger Hiss and for its investigation of the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC was a House committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938–1975).\n\nSimilarly, the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) was a five-member committee established by the McCarran Internal Security Act in 1950, which had a mandate, similar to HUAC and inspired by McCarthy, to locate and investigate so-called \"subversives\", or those sympathetic to the Communists. They were accused of promoting the establishment of a \"totalitarian dictatorship\" in the United States. President Truman vetoed the act, sending Congress a lengthy veto message in which he criticized specific provisions as \"the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798,\" and called it a \"mockery of the Bill of Rights\" and a \"long step toward totalitarianism\"; his veto was overridden. SACB was active for 18 years (1950–1968), but the Supreme Court did not rule all sections of the law were unconstitutional until 1993.\n\nFrom the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term \"McCarthyism\" appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.\n\nIn 1951, Ray Bradbury published \"The Fireman\", an allegory on suppression of ideas. This served as the basis for \"Fahrenheit 451\" published in 1953. Bradbury said that he wrote \"Fahrenheit 451\" because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States.\n\nIn 1953, the popular daily comic strip \"Pogo\" introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.\n\nIn 1953, playwright Arthur Miller published \"The Crucible\", suggesting the Salem Witch Trials were analogous to McCarthyism.\n\nAs his fame grew, McCarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody. He was impersonated by nightclub and radio impressionists and was satirized in \"Mad\" magazine, on \"The Red Skelton Show\", and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler, \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by Hal Block, and unionist folk singer Joe Glazer's \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"McNamara's Band\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team Bob and Ray parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network broadcast a satire, \"The Investigator\", whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.\n\nThe 1953 novel \"Mr. Costello, Hero\" by Theodore Sturgeon was described by noted journalist and author Paul Williams as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"\n\n\"Mr. Costello, Hero\" was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy Hearings that prompted him to write the story.\n\nA more serious fictional portrayal of McCarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\" by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.\n\nThe 1962 novel \"Advise and Consent\" by Allen Drury features an overzealous demagogue, Senator Fred Van Ackerman, based on McCarthy. Although the fictional senator is an ultra liberal who proposes surrender to the Soviet Union, his portrayal strongly resembles the popular perception of McCarthy's character and methods.\n\nMcCarthy was portrayed by Peter Boyle in the 1977 Emmy-winning television movie \"Tail Gunner Joe\", a dramatization of McCarthy's life. Archival footage of McCarthy himself was used in the 2005 movie \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" about Edward R. Murrow and the \"See It Now\" episode that challenged McCarthy. McCarthy was also portrayed by Joe Don Baker in the 1992 HB] film \"Citizen Cohn\". In the German-French docu-drama \"The Real American – Joe McCarthy\" (2012), directed by Lutz Hachmeister, McCarthy is portrayed by the British actor and comedian John Sessions. \nR.E.M.'s song \"Exhuming McCarthy\" from their 1987 album \"Document\" largely deals with McCarthy and contains sound clips from the Army-McCarthy Hearings.\n\n'Joe' McCarthy is also mentioned in Billy Joel's 1989 song \"We Didn't Start the Fire.\"\n\nMcCarthyism is one of the subjects of Barbara Kingsolver's novel \"The Lacuna\".\n\nBULLET::::- List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950–99)\nBULLET::::- List of United States Senators expelled or censured\n\nBULLET::::- Anderson, Jack and May, Ronald W (1952). \"McCarthy: the man, the Senator, the \"ism,\"\" Beacon Press.\nBULLET::::- Crosby, Donald F. \"The Jesuits and Joe McCarthy\". \"Church History\" 1977 46(3): 374–388.

{"id": "16324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16324", "title": "John Hancock", "text": "John Hancock\n\nJohn Hancock ( – October 8, 1793) was an American merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term \"John Hancock\" has become a synonym in the United States for one's signature.\n\nBefore the American Revolution, Hancock was one of the wealthiest men in the Thirteen Colonies, having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle. He began his political career in Boston as a protégé of Samuel Adams, an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and Great Britain in the 1760s. He became very popular in Massachusetts, especially after British officials seized his sloop \"Liberty\" in 1768 and charged him with smuggling. Those charges were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.\n\nHancock was one of Boston's leaders during the crisis that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. He served more than two years in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, and he was the first to sign the Declaration of Independence in his position as president of Congress. He returned to Massachusetts and was elected governor of the Commonwealth, serving in that role for most of his remaining years. He used his influence to ensure that Massachusetts ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.\n\nJohn Hancock was born on January 23, 1737 in Braintree, Massachusetts, in a part of town that eventually became the separate city of Quincy. He was the son of Col. John Hancock Jr. of Braintree and Mary Hawke Thaxter (widow of Samuel Thaxter Junior), who was from nearby Hingham. As a child, Hancock became a casual acquaintance of young John Adams, whom the Reverend Hancock had baptized in 1735. The Hancocks lived a comfortable life, and owned one slave to help with household work.\n\nAfter Hancock's father died in 1744, John was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, Thomas Hancock and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the proprietor of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish. Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents. He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in Hancock Manor on Beacon Hill. The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the dominant influence on John's life.\n\nAfter graduating from the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock enrolled in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed playing the role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.\n\nFrom 1760 to 1761, Hancock lived in England while building relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually took over the House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763. He became a member of the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens. When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands of acres of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.\n\nAfter its victory in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to directly tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which was seen as a victimless crime.\n\nNot only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorized. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England, brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to the end of 1682—and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded.\n\nThe Sugar Act provoked outrage in Boston, where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.\n\nHancock emerged as a leading political figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, he thought that the colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.\n\nHancock's political success benefited from the support of Samuel Adams, the clerk of the House of Representatives and a leader of Boston's \"popular party\", also known as \"Whigs\" and later as \"Patriots\". The two men made an unlikely pair. Fifteen years older than Hancock, Adams had a somber, Puritan outlook that stood in marked contrast to Hancock's taste for luxury and extravagance. Apocryphal stories later portrayed Adams as masterminding Hancock's political rise so that the merchant's wealth could be used to further the Whig agenda. Historian James Truslow Adams portrayed Hancock as shallow and vain, easily manipulated by Adams. Historian William M. Fowler, who wrote biographies of both men, argued that this characterization was an exaggeration, and that the relationship between the two was symbiotic, with Adams as the mentor and Hancock the protégé.\n\nAfter the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.\n\nColonial merchants, even those not involved in smuggling, found the new regulations oppressive. Other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by Parliament to tax the colonies without their consent. Hancock joined other Bostonians in calling for a boycott of British imports until the Townshend duties were repealed. In their enforcement of the customs regulations, the Customs Board targeted Hancock, Boston's wealthiest Whig. They may have suspected that he was a smuggler, or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics, especially after Hancock snubbed Governor Francis Bernard by refusing to attend public functions when the customs officials were present.\n\nOn April 9, 1768, two customs employees (called \"tidesmen\") boarded Hancock's brig \"Lydia\" in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, and finding that the agents lacked a writ of assistance (a general search warrant), he did not allow them to go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck. Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.\n\nThe next incident proved to be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop \"Liberty\" arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.\n\nOne month later, while the British warship HMS \"Romney\" was in port, one of the tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed that he had been forcibly held on the \"Liberty\" while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the \"Liberty\". Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the \"Romney\" had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the \"Liberty\" out to the \"Romney\", which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the \"Liberty\" were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the \"Romney\", and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.\n\nBritish officials filed two lawsuits stemming from the \"Liberty\" incident: an \"in rem\" suit against the ship, and an \"in personam\" suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the \"Liberty\" in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.\n\nThe second trial began in October 1768, when charges were filed against Hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from the \"Liberty\" without paying the duties. If convicted, the defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine, which came to £9,000. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice admiralty court, which had no jury and did not always allow the defense to cross-examine the witnesses. After dragging out for nearly five months, the proceedings against Hancock were dropped without explanation.\n\nAlthough the charges against Hancock were dropped, many writers later described him as a smuggler. The accuracy of this characterization has been questioned. \"Hancock's guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him\", wrote historian John W. Tyler in 1986, \"are still fiercely debated.\" Historian Oliver Dickerson argued that Hancock was the victim of an essentially criminal racketeering scheme perpetrated by Governor Bernard and the customs officials. Dickerson believed that there is no reliable evidence that Hancock was guilty in the \"Liberty\" case, and that the purpose of the trials was to punish Hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property. Opposed to Dickerson's interpretation were Kinvin Wroth and Hiller Zobel, the editors of John Adams's legal papers, who argued that \"Hancock's innocence is open to question\", and that the British officials acted legally, if unwisely. Lawyer and historian Bernard Knollenberg concluded that the customs officials had the right to seize Hancock's ship, but towing it out to the \"Romney\" had been illegal. Legal historian John Phillip Reid argued that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident.\n\nAside from the \"Liberty\" affair, the degree to which Hancock was engaged in smuggling, which may have been widespread in the colonies, has been questioned. Given the clandestine nature of smuggling, records are scarce. If Hancock was a smuggler, no documentation of this has been found. John W. Tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary Boston, but found no written evidence that Hancock was one of them. Biographer William Fowler concluded that while Hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling, most of his business was legitimate, and his later reputation as the \"king of the colonial smugglers\" is a myth without foundation.\n\nThe \"Liberty\" affair reinforced a previously made British decision to suppress unrest in Boston with a show of military might. The decision had been prompted by Samuel Adams's 1768 Circular Letter, which was sent to other British American colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the Townshend Acts. Lord Hillsborough, secretary of state for the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials, and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter, and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard's recall. When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.\n\nThe British troops remained, however, and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of March 1770. Hancock was not involved in the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops. Meeting with Bernard's successor, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, and the British officer in command, Colonel William Dalrymple, Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if the troops did not leave. Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn. His reelection to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.\n\nAfter Parliament partially repealed the Townshend duties in 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried to improve his relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for the governor and the General Court. In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.\n\nHutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over Hancock and discredit Adams. To some, it seemed that Adams and Hancock were indeed at odds: when Adams formed the Boston Committee of Correspondence in November 1772 to advocate colonial rights, Hancock declined to join, creating the impression that there was a split in the Whig ranks. But whatever their differences, Hancock and Adams came together again in 1773 with the renewal of major political turmoil. They cooperated in the revelation of private letters of Thomas Hutchinson, in which the governor seemed to recommend \"an abridgement of what are called English liberties\" to bring order to the colony. The Massachusetts House, blaming Hutchinson for the military occupation of Boston, called for his removal as governor.\n\nEven more trouble followed Parliament's passage of the 1773 Tea Act. On November 5, Hancock was elected as moderator at a Boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the Tea Act was an \"Enemy to America\". Hancock and others tried to force the resignation of the agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments. Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16, where he reportedly told the crowd, \"Let every man do what is right in his own eyes.\" Hancock did not take part in the Boston Tea Party that night, but he approved of the action, although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.\n\nOver the next few months, Hancock was disabled by gout, which would trouble him with increasing frequency in the coming years. By March 5, 1774, he had recovered enough to deliver the fourth annual Massacre Day oration, a commemoration of the Boston Massacre. Hancock's speech denounced the presence of British troops in Boston, who he said had been sent there \"to enforce obedience to acts of Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make\". The speech, probably written by Hancock in collaboration with Adams, Joseph Warren, and others, was published and widely reprinted, enhancing Hancock's stature as a leading Patriot.\n\nParliament responded to the Tea Party with the Boston Port Act, one of the so-called Coercive Acts intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General Thomas Gage, who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts. Hancock did not serve in the first Congress, possibly for health reasons, or possibly to remain in charge while the other Patriot leaders were away.\n\nGage soon dismissed Hancock from his post as colonel of the Boston Cadets. In October 1774, Gage canceled the scheduled meeting of the General Court. In response, the House resolved itself into the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, a body independent of British control. Hancock was elected as president of the Provincial Congress and was a key member of the Committee of Safety. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment's notice.\n\nOn December 1, 1774, the Provincial Congress elected Hancock as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress to replace James Bowdoin, who had been unable to attend the first Congress because of illness. Before Hancock reported to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, the Provincial Congress unanimously reelected him as their president in February 1775. Hancock's multiple roles gave him enormous influence in Massachusetts, and as early as January 1774 British officials had considered arresting him. After attending the Provincial Congress in Concord in April 1775, Hancock and Samuel Adams decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia. They stayed instead at Hancock's childhood home in Lexington.\n\nGage received a letter from Lord Dartmouth on April 14, 1775, advising him \"to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the Provincial Congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion\". On the night of April 18, Gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that would spark the American Revolutionary War. The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams; if so, the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders. Gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting Hancock and Adams, since other leaders would simply take their place, and the British would be portrayed as the aggressors.\n\nAlthough Gage had evidently decided against seizing Hancock and Adams, Patriots initially believed otherwise. From Boston, Joseph Warren dispatched messenger Paul Revere to warn Hancock and Adams that British troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them. Revere reached Lexington around midnight and gave the warning. Hancock, still considering himself a militia colonel, wanted to take the field with the Patriot militia at Lexington, but Adams and others convinced him to avoid battle, arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier. As Hancock and Adams made their escape, the first shots of the war were fired at Lexington and Concord. Soon after the battle, Gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would \"lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects\"—with the exceptions of Hancock and Samuel Adams. Singling out Hancock and Adams in this manner only added to their renown among Patriots.\n\nWith the war underway, Hancock made his way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was unanimously elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous, because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.\n\nIn Congress on June 15, 1775, Massachusetts delegate John Adams nominated George Washington as commander-in-chief of the army then gathered around Boston. Years later, Adams wrote that Hancock had shown great disappointment at not getting the command for himself. This brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oft-cited claim that Hancock sought to become commander-in-chief. In the early 20th century, historian James Truslow Adams wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between Hancock and Washington, but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident, or the estrangement, ever occurred. According to historian Donald Proctor, \"There is no contemporary evidence that Hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander-in-chief. Quite the contrary.\" Hancock and Washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident, and in 1778 Hancock named his only son \"John George Washington Hancock\". Hancock admired and supported General Washington, even though Washington politely declined Hancock's request for a military appointment.\n\nWhen Congress recessed on August 1, 1775, Hancock took the opportunity to wed his fiancée, Dorothy \"Dolly\" Quincy. The couple was married on August 28 in Fairfield, Connecticut. John and Dorothy would have two children, neither of whom survived to adulthood. Their daughter Lydia Henchman Hancock was born in 1776 and died ten months later. Their son John was born in 1778 and died in 1787 after suffering a head injury while ice skating.\n\nWhile president of Congress, Hancock became involved in a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In the rush of events at the onset of the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress. In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, but he turned over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.\n\nHancock served in Congress through some of the darkest days of the Revolutionary War. The British drove Washington from New York and New Jersey in 1776, which prompted Congress to flee to Baltimore, Maryland. Hancock and Congress returned to Philadelphia in March 1777, but were compelled to flee six months later when the British occupied Philadelphia. Hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials, raising money, supplies, and troops for Washington's army. He chaired the Marine Committee, and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of American frigates, including the USS \"Hancock\", which was named in his honor.\n\nHancock was president of Congress when the Declaration of Independence was adopted and signed. He is primarily remembered by Americans for his large, flamboyant signature on the Declaration, so much so that \"John Hancock\" became, in the United States, an informal synonym for \"signature\". According to legend, Hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that King George could read it without his spectacles, but the story is apocryphal and originated years later.\n\nContrary to popular mythology, there was no ceremonial signing of the Declaration on July 4, 1776. After Congress approved the wording of the text on July 4, the \"fair copy\" was sent to be printed. As president, Hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer John Dunlap, but this is uncertain because that document is lost, perhaps destroyed in the printing process. Dunlap produced the first published version of the Declaration, the widely distributed Dunlap broadside. Hancock, as President of Congress, was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside, although the name of Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress, but not a delegate, was also on it as \"Attested by\" implying that Hancock had signed the fair copy. This meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of the signers listed, Hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document. Hancock sent a copy of the Dunlap broadside to George Washington, instructing him to have it read to the troops \"in the way you shall think most proper\".\n\nHancock's name was printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic signature appears on a different document—a sheet of parchment that was carefully handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present. Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document on display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn October 1777, after more than two years in Congress, President Hancock requested a leave of absence. He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home. By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.\n\nBack in Boston, Hancock was reelected to the House of Representatives. As in previous years, his philanthropy made him popular. Although his finances had suffered greatly because of the war, he gave to the poor, helped support widows and orphans, and loaned money to friends. According to biographer William Fowler, \"John Hancock was a generous man and the people loved him for it. He was their idol.\" In December 1777, he was reelected as a delegate to the Continental Congress and as moderator of the Boston town meeting.\nHancock rejoined the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief time there was unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, which was a disappointment to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.\n\nHancock returned to Boston in July 1778, motivated by the opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia. Now that the French fleet had come to the aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General John Sullivan of the Continental Army to lead an attack on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral d'Estaing abandoned the operation, after which Hancock's militia mostly deserted Sullivan's Continentals. Hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.\n\nAfter much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution finally went into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.\n\nHancock governed Massachusetts through the end of the Revolutionary War and into an economically troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins. Hancock took a hands-off approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock \"never really led\" and \"never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth.\" Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came. Hancock's critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations. Historian James Truslow Adams wrote that Hancock's \"two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it\". The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as Shays's Rebellion, which Hancock's successor James Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was reelected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels. Hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.\n\nWhen he had resigned as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a delegate to Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Hancock was elected to serve as its president on November 23, 1785, but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was disinterested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in June 1786.\n\nIn an effort to remedy the perceived defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 and then to the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.\n\nHancock was put forth as a candidate in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington was going to be elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.\n\nHis health failing, Hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor. With his wife at his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at 56 years of age. By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock's burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an American up to that time.\n\nDespite his grand funeral, Hancock faded from popular memory after his death. According to historian Alfred F. Young, \"Boston celebrated only one hero in the half-century after the Revolution: George Washington.\" As early as 1809, John Adams lamented that Hancock and Samuel Adams were \"almost buried in oblivion\". In Boston, little effort was made to preserve Hancock's historical legacy. His house on Beacon Hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it. According to Young, the conservative \"new elite\" of Massachusetts \"was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution\". In 1876, with the centennial of American independence renewing popular interest in the Revolution, plaques honoring Hancock were put up in Boston. In 1896, a memorial column was finally erected over Hancock's essentially unmarked grave in the Granary Burying Ground.\n\nNo full-length biography of Hancock appeared until the 20th century. A challenge facing Hancock biographers is that, compared to prominent Founding Fathers like Jefferson and John Adams, Hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life. As a result, most depictions of Hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents, who were often scathingly critical of him. According to historian Charles Akers, \"The chief victim of Massachusetts historiography has been John Hancock, the most gifted and popular politician in the Bay State's long history. He suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors, Tory and Whig.\"\n\nHancock's most influential 20th-century detractor was historian James Truslow Adams, who wrote negative portraits of Hancock in \"Harper's Magazine\" and the \"Dictionary of American Biography\" in the 1930s. Adams argued that Hancock was a \"fair presiding officer\" but had \"no great ability\", and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth. Decades later, historian Donald Proctor argued that Adams had uncritically repeated the negative views of Hancock's political opponents without doing any serious research. Adams \"presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes, sometimes partially documented, sometimes not documented at all, which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of Hancock\". According to Proctor, Adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto Hancock, and ended up misrepresenting several key events in Hancock's career. Writing in the 1970s, Proctor and Akers called for scholars to evaluate Hancock based on his merits, rather than on the views of his critics. Since that time, historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of Hancock, while acknowledging that he was not an important writer, political theorist, or military leader.\n\nMany places and things in the United States have been named in honor of John Hancock. The U.S. Navy has named vessels USS \"Hancock\" and USS \"John Hancock\"; a World War II Liberty ship was also named in his honor. Ten states have a Hancock County named for him; other places named after him include Hancock, Massachusetts; Hancock, Michigan; Hancock, New Hampshire; Hancock, New York; and Mount Hancock in New Hampshire. John Hancock University is named for him, as was the John Hancock Financial company, founded in Boston in 1862; it had no connection to Hancock's own business ventures. The financial company passed on the name to the John Hancock Tower in Boston, the John Hancock Center in Chicago, as well as the John Hancock Student Village at Boston University.\n\nBULLET::::- American Revolution\nBULLET::::- List of richest Americans in history\nBULLET::::- List of wealthiest historical figures\nBULLET::::- Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence\nBULLET::::- United States Declaration of Independence\n\nBULLET::::- Baxter, William T. \"The House of Hancock: Business in Boston, 1724–1775\". 1945.

{"id": "16326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16326", "title": "John W. Campbell", "text": "John W. Campbell\n\nJohn Wood Campbell Jr. (June 8, 1910 – July 11, 1971) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He was editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (later called \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\") from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. His novella \"Who Goes There?\" was adapted as the films \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), \"The Thing\" (1982), and \"The Thing\" (2011).\n\nCampbell began writing science fiction at age 18 while attending MIT. He published six short stories, one novel, and six letters in the science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\" from 1930 to 1931. This work established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to write stories with a different tone, he wrote as Don A. Stuart. From 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names, though he stopped writing fiction shortly after he became editor of \"Astounding\" in 1937.\n\nIt is as editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (later called \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\") from late 1937 until his death for which Campbell is primarily remembered today. Also, in 1939, Campbell started the fantasy magazine \"Unknown,\" although it was canceled after only four years. Referring to his time spent as an editor, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: \"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf.\" Isaac Asimov called Campbell \"the most powerful force in science fiction ever\" and said the \"first ten years of his editorship he dominated the field completely.\" In his capacity as an editor, Campbell published some of the very earliest work, and helped shape the careers of virtually every important science-fiction author to debut between 1938 and 1946, including Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nAn increasingly strong interest in pseudoscience later alienated Campbell from many of the writers whose careers he had nurtured; Heinlein, Sturgeon, Asimov, and Clarke rarely worked with him after about 1950. As well, beginning in the 1960s, Campbell's controversial essays supporting segregation, and other remarks and writings surrounding slavery and race, served to distance him from many in the science fiction community. Nevertheless, Campbell remained an important figure in science fiction publishing up until his death. Campbell and \"Astounding\" shared one of the inaugural Hugo Awards with H. L. Gold and \"Galaxy\" at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention. Subsequently, Campbell and \"Astounding\" (later renamed \"Analog\") won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine seven times.\n\nShortly after his death in 1971, the University of Kansas science fiction program established the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and also renamed after him its annual Campbell Conference. The World Science Fiction Society established the annual John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, since renamed the Astounding Award for Best New Writer. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Campbell in 1996, in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.\n\nJohn Campbell was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1910. His father was an electrical engineer. His mother, Dorothy (née Strahern) had an identical twin who visited them often and who disliked John. John was unable to tell them apart and says he was frequently rebuffed by the person he took to be his mother. Campbell attended the Blair Academy, a boarding school in rural Warren County, New Jersey, but did not graduate because of lack of credits for French and trigonometry.\nHe also attended, without graduating, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was befriended by the mathematician Norbert Wiener (who coined the term \"cybernetics\") – but he failed German and MIT dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.\n\nCampbell began writing science fiction at age 18 while attending MIT and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, \"Amazing Stories\" published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Campbell was editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (later called \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\") from late 1937 until his death. He stopped writing fiction after he became editor of \"Astounding\". Between December 11, 1957, and June 13, 1958, he hosted a weekly science fiction radio program called \"Exploring Tomorrow\". The scripts were written by authors such as Gordon R. Dickson and Robert Silverberg.\n\nCampbell and Doña Stewart married in 1931. They divorced in 1949 and he married Margaret (Peg) Winter in 1950. He spent most of his life in New Jersey and died of heart failure at his home in Mountainside, New Jersey. He was an atheist.\n\nEditor T. O'Conor Sloane lost Campbell's first manuscript that he accepted for \"Amazing Stories\", entitled \"Invaders of the Infinite\". \"When the Atoms Failed\" appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade. A complete novel in the series, \"Islands of Space\", was the cover story in the Spring 1931 \"Quarterly\". During 1934–35 a serial novel, \"The Mightiest Machine\", ran in \"Astounding Stories\", edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", edited by Mort Weisinger.\n\nThe early work for \"Amazing\" established Campbell's reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to publish stories with a different tone he wrote as Don A. Stuart, a pseudonym derived from his wife's maiden name.\n\nFrom 1930 until the later part of that decade, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names. Three significant stories published under the pseudonym are \"Twilight\" (\"Astounding\", November 1934), \"Night\" (\"Astounding\", October 1935), and \"Who Goes There?\" (\"Astounding\", August 1938). \"Who Goes There?\", about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in \"Astounding\" almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), \"The Thing\" (1982), and again as \"The Thing\" (2011).\n\nCampbell held the amateur radio call sign W2ZGU, and wrote many articles on electronics and radio for a wide range of magazines.\n\nTremaine hired Campbell to succeed him as the editor of \"Astounding\" from its October 1937 issue. Campbell was not given full authority for \"Astounding\" until May 1938, but had been responsible for buying stories somewhat earlier. He began to make changes almost immediately, instigating a \"mutant\" label for unusual stories, and in March 1938 changing the title from \"Astounding Stories\" to \"Astounding Science-Fiction\".\n\nLester del Rey's first story, in March 1938, was an early find for Campbell, and in 1939, he published such an extraordinary group of new writers for the first time that the period is generally regarded as the beginning of the \"Golden Age of Science Fiction\", and the July 1939 issue in particular. The July issue contained A. E. van Vogt's first story, \"Black Destroyer\", and Asimov's early story \"Trends\"; August brought Robert A. Heinlein's first story, \"Life-Line\", and the next month Theodore Sturgeon's first story appeared.\n\nAlso in 1939, Campbell started the fantasy magazine \"Unknown\" (later \"Unknown Worlds\"). Although \"Unknown\" was canceled after only four years, a victim of wartime paper shortages, the magazine's editorial direction was significant in the evolution of modern fantasy.\n\n\"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" wrote: \"More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf\", and Darrell Schweitzer credits him with having \"decreed that SF writers should pull themselves up out of the pulp mire and start writing intelligently, for adults.\" After 1950, new magazines such as \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" and \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including \"Write me a creature that thinks \"as well as\" a man, or \"better than\" a man, but not \"like\" a man\"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.\n\nCampbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov said of Campbell's influence on the field: By his own example and by his instruction and by his undeviating and persisting insistence, he forced first \"Astounding\" and then all science fiction into his mold. He abandoned the earlier orientation of the field. He demolished the stock characters who had filled it; eradicated the penny dreadful plots; extirpated the Sunday-supplement science. In a phrase, he blotted out the purple of pulp. Instead, he demanded that science-fiction writers understand science and understand people, a hard requirement that many of the established writers of the 1930s could not meet. Campbell did not compromise because of that: those who could not meet his requirements could not sell to him, and the carnage was as great as it had been in Hollywood a decade before, while silent movies had given way to the talkies.\n\nOne example of the type of speculative but plausible science fiction that Campbell demanded from his writers is \"Deadline\", a short story by Cleve Cartmill that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell's successor as editor at \"Analog\", wrote, it \"described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.\" The FBI descended on Campbell's office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine \"the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons\" and the demand was dropped.\n\nCampbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story \"The Cold Equations\". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted ... Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since the strength of this deservedly classic story lies in the fact that the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived.\n\nBetween December 11, 1957, and June 13, 1958, Campbell hosted a weekly science fiction radio program called \"Exploring Tomorrow\".\n\nGreen wrote that Campbell \"enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate.\" As an example, he wrote, Campbell pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others – and some \"Analog\" editorials I had read – that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks. Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that \"rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.\"\n\nIn a June 1961 editorial called \"Civil War Centennial\", Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote, It's my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done – and done right – half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist – if the lathes work well under his hands – the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.\n\nAccording to Michael Moorcock, Campbell suggested that some people preferred slavery. He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.\nIn 1963, Campbell published an essay supporting segregated schools and arguing that \"the Negro race\" had failed to \"produce[] super-high-geniuses\". In 1965, he continued his defense of segregation and related practices, critiquing \"the arrogant defiance of law by many of the Negro 'Civil Rights' groups\". On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delany's \"Nova\" a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he did not feel his readership \"would be able to relate to a black main character\".\n\nCampbell was a critic of government regulation of health and safety, excoriating numerous public health initiatives and regulations.\n\nCampbell was a heavy smoker throughout his life and was seldom seen without his customary cigarette holder. In the \"Analog\" of September 1964, nine months after the Surgeon General's first major warning about the dangers of cigarette smoking had been issued (January 11, 1964) Campbell ran an editorial, \"A Counterblaste to Tobacco\" that took its title from the anti-smoking book of the same name by King James I of England. In it, he stated that the connection to lung cancer was \"esoteric\" and referred to \"a barely determinable possible correlation between cigarette smoking and cancer.\" He said that tobacco's calming effects led to more effective thinking.\n\nHowever, in a one-page piece about automobile safety in the \"Analog\" dated May 1967, Campbell wrote of \"people suddenly becoming conscious of the fact that cars kill more people than cigarettes do, even if the antitobacco alarmists were completely right...\"\n\nHis critiques of government regulation of health risks were not limited to tobacco. In 1963, Campbell published an angry editorial about Frances Oldham Kelsey who, while at the FDA, refused to permit thalidomide from being sold in the United States.\n\nIn a number of other essays, Campbell supported crank medicine, arguing that government regulation was more harmful than beneficial and that regulating quackery prevented the use of many possible beneficial medicines (\"e.g.\", krebiozen).\n\nIn the 1930s Campbell became interested in Joseph Rhine's theories about ESP (Rhine had already founded Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University when Campbell was a student there), and over the following years his growing interest in parapsychology would be reflected in the stories he published when he encouraged the writers to include these topics in their tales, leading to the publication of numerous works about telepathy and other \"psionic\" abilities. This post-war \"psi-boom\" has been dated by science fiction scholars to roughly the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and continues to influence many popular culture tropes and motifs.\n\nHis increasing beliefs in pseudoscience would eventually start to isolate and alienate him from some of his own writers. He wrote favorably about such things as the \"Dean drive\", a device that supposedly produced thrust in violation of Newton's third law, and the \"Hieronymus machine\", which could supposedly amplify psi powers.\n\nIn 1949, Campbell also became interested in Dianetics. He wrote of L. Ron Hubbard's initial article in \"Astounding\" that \"[i]t is, I assure you in full and absolute sincerity, one of the most important articles ever published.\"\n\nAsimov wrote: \"A number of writers wrote pseudoscientific stuff to ensure sales to Campbell, but the best writers retreated, I among them. ...\" Elsewhere Asimov went on to further explain, Campbell championed far-out ideas ... He pained very many of the men he had trained (including me) in doing so, but felt it was his duty to stir up the minds of his readers and force curiosity right out to the border lines. He began a series of editorials ... in which he championed a social point of view that could sometimes be described as far right (he expressed sympathy for George Wallace in the 1968 national election, for instance). There was bitter opposition to this from many (including me – I could hardly ever read a Campbell editorial and keep my temper).\n\nDamon Knight described Campbell as a \"portly, bristled-haired blond man with a challenging stare.\" \"Six-foot-one, with hawklike features, he presented a formidable appearance,\" said Sam Moskowitz. \"He was a tall, large man with light hair, a beaky nose, a wide face with thin lips, and with a cigarette in a holder forever clamped between his teeth\", wrote Asimov.\n\nAlgis Budrys wrote that \"John W. Campbell was the greatest editor SF has seen or is likely to see, and is in fact one of the major editors in all English-language literature in the middle years of the twentieth century. All about you is the heritage of what he built\".\n\nAsimov said that Campbell was \"talkative, opinionated, quicksilver-minded, overbearing. Talking to him meant listening to a monologue ...\" Knight agreed: \"Campbell's lecture-room manner was so unpleasant to me that I was unwilling to face it. Campbell talked a good deal more than he listened, and he liked to say outrageous things.\"\n\nBritish novelist and critic Kingsley Amis dismissed Campbell brusquely: \"I might just add as a sociological note that the editor of \"Astounding,\" himself a deviant figure of marked ferocity, seems to think he has invented a psi machine.\"\n\nSeveral science-fiction novelists have criticized Campbell as prejudiced – Samuel R. Delany for Campbell's rejection of a novel due to the black main character, and Joe Haldeman in the dedication of \"Forever Peace\", for rejecting a novel due to a female soldier protagonist.\n\nBritish science-fiction novelist Michael Moorcock, as part of his \"Starship Stormtroopers\" editorial, said Campbell's \"Stories\" and its writers were \"wild-eyed paternalists to a man, fierce anti-socialists\" with \"[stories] full of crew-cut wisecracking, cigar-chewing, competent guys (like Campbell's image of himself)\", who had success because their \"work reflected the deep-seated conservatism of the majority of their readers, who saw a Bolshevik menace in every union meeting\". He viewed Campbell as turning the magazine into a vessel for right-wing politics, \"by the early 1950s ... a crypto-fascist deeply philistine magazine pretending to intellectualism and offering idealistic kids an 'alternative' that was, of course, no alternative at all\".\n\nSF writer Alfred Bester, an editor of \"Holiday Magazine\" and a sophisticated Manhattanite, recounted at some length his \"one demented meeting\" with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be \"a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford.\" The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to \"think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You've never stopped hating her for it.\" Bester commented: \"It reinforced my private opinion that a majority of the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles.\"\n\nCampbell died in 1971 at the age of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At the time of his sudden death after 34 years at the helm of \"Analog,\" Campbell's quirky personality and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers to the point that they no longer submitted works to him. After 1950, Theodore Sturgeon only published one story in \"Astounding\" but dozens in other magazines.\n\nAsimov remained grateful for Campbell's early friendship and support. He dedicated \"The Early Asimov\" (1972) to him, and concluded it by stating that \"There is no way at all to express how much he meant to me and how much he did for me except, perhaps, to write this book evoking, once more, those days of a quarter century ago\". His final word on Campbell, however, was that \"in the last twenty years of his life, he was only a diminishing shadow of what he had once been.\" Even Heinlein, perhaps Campbell's most important discovery and a \"fast friend\", eventually tired of him.\n\nPoul Anderson wrote that Campbell \"had saved and regenerated science fiction\", which had become \"the product of hack pulpsters\" when he took over \"Astounding\". \"By his editorial policies and the help and encouragement he gave his writers (always behind the scenes), he raised both the literary and the intellectual standard anew. Whatever progress has been made stems from that renaissance\".\n\nShortly after Campbell's death, the University of Kansas science fiction program – now the Center for the Study of Science Fiction – established the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and also renamed after him its annual Campbell Conference. The World Science Fiction Society established the annual John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. All three memorials became effective in 1973. However, following Jeannette Ng's August 2019 acceptance speech of the award for Best New Writer at Worldcon 77, in which she called out Campbell's politics, the publishers of \"Analog\" magazine announced that the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer would immediately be renamed to \"The \"Astounding Award\" for Best New Writer\".\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Campbell in 1996, in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.\n\nCampbell and \"Astounding\" shared one of the inaugural Hugo Awards with H. L. Gold and \"Galaxy\" at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention. Subsequently, he won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine seven times to 1965. In 2018 he won a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Editor, Short Form (1943).\n\nThe Martian impact crater Campbell was named after him.\n\nThis shortened bibliography lists each title once.

{"id": "16327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16327", "title": "Joule", "text": "Joule\n\nThe joule ( ; symbol: J) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).\n\nIn terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units, a joule is defined below, where kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt:\n\nOne joule can also be defined as the following:\nBULLET::::- The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one \"coulomb-volt\" (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.\nBULLET::::- The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one \"watt-second\" (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.\n\nThe cgs system had been declared official in 1881, at the first International Electrical Congress.\nThe erg was adopted as its unit of energy in 1882. Wilhelm Siemens, in his inauguration speech as chairman of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (23 August 1882) first proposed the \"Joule\" as unit of heat, to be derived from the electromagnetic units Ampere and Ohm, in cgs units equivalent to .\nThe naming of the unit in honour of James Prescott Joule (1818–1889), at the time retired but still living (aged 63), is due to Siemens:\n\nAt the second International Electrical Congress, on 31 August 1889, the joule was officially adopted alongside the watt and the \"quadrant\" (later renamed to henry).\nJoule died in the same year, on 11 October 1889.\nAt the fourth congress (1893), the \"international Ampere\" and \"international Ohm\" were defined, with slight changes in the specifications for their measurement, with the \"international Joule\" being the unit derived from them.\n\nIn 1935, the International Electrotechnical Commission (as the successor organisation of the International Electrical Congress) adopted the \"Giorgi system\", which by virtue of assuming a defined value for the magnetic constant also implied a redefinition of the Joule. The Giorgi system was approved by the International Committee for Weights and Measures in 1946. The joule was now no longer defined based on electromagnetic unit, but instead as the unit of work performed by one unit of force (at the time not yet named newton)\nover the distance of 1 metre. The joule was explicitly intended as the unit of energy to be used in both electromagnetic and mechanical contexts. The ratification of the definition at the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures, in 1948,\nadded the specification that the joule was also to be preferred as the unit of heat in the context of calorimetry, thereby officially deprecating the use of the calorie. \nThis definition was the direct precursor of the joule as adopted in the modern International System of Units in 1960.\n\nThe definition of the joule as J=kg⋅m⋅s has remained unchanged since 1946, but the joule as a derived unit has inherited changes in the definitions of the second (in 1960 and 1967), the metre (in 1983) and the kilogram (in 2019).\n\nOne joule in everyday life represents approximately:\nBULLET::::- The energy required to lift a medium-sized tomato up (assume the tomato has a mass of approximately ).\nBULLET::::- The energy released when that same tomato falls back down one metre.\nBULLET::::- The energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m⋅s through a distance of 1 m.\nBULLET::::- The heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 °C.\nBULLET::::- The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17 ms).\nBULLET::::- The kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly ().\nBULLET::::- The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at .\nBULLET::::- The kinetic energy of an object with mass 2 kg moving at 1 m/s.\nBULLET::::- The amount of electricity required to light a 1 W LED for 1 s.\n\nSince the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW⋅h (kilowatt-hour), a kW⋅h is thus 1000 W × 3600 s = 3.6 MJ (megajoules).\n\nBULLET::::- Yoctojoule: The yoctojoule (yJ) is equal to (10) of one joule.\nBULLET::::- Zeptojoule: The zeptojoule (zJ) is equal to one sextillionth (10) of one joule. 160 zeptojoules is about one electronvolt. The minimal energy needed to change a bit at around room temperature – approximately 2.75 zJ – is given by the Landauer limit.\nBULLET::::- Attojoule: The attojoule (aJ) is equal to (10) of one joule.\nBULLET::::- Femtojoule: The femtojoule (fJ) is equal to (10) of one joule.\nBULLET::::- Picojoule: The picojoule (pJ) is equal to one trillionth (10) of one joule.\nBULLET::::- Nanojoule: The nanojoule (nJ) is equal to one billionth (10) of one joule. 160 nanojoules is about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito.\nBULLET::::- Microjoule: The microjoule (μJ) is equal to one millionth (10) of one joule. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produces collisions of the microjoule order (7 TeV) per particle.\nBULLET::::- Millijoule: The millijoule (mJ) is equal to one thousandth (10) of a joule.\nBULLET::::- Kilojoule: The kilojoule (kJ) is equal to one thousand (10) joules. Nutritional food labels in most countries express energy in kilojoules (kJ). One square metre of the Earth receives about 1.4 kilojoules of solar radiation every second in full daylight.\nBULLET::::- Megajoule: The megajoule (MJ) is equal to one million (10) joules, or approximately the kinetic energy of a one megagram (tonne) vehicle moving at 161 km/h. The energy required to heat 10 liters of liquid water at constant pressure from to is approximately 4.2 MJ. One kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 megajoules.\nBULLET::::- Gigajoule: The gigajoule (GJ) is equal to one billion (10) joules. 6 GJ is about the chemical energy of combusting of crude oil. 2 GJ is about the Planck energy unit.\nBULLET::::- Terajoule: The terajoule (TJ) is equal to one trillion (10) joules; or about 0.278 GWh (which is often used in energy tables). About 63 TJ of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima. The International Space Station, with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7 km/s, has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 TJ. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was estimated to have a peak wind energy of 112 TJ.\nBULLET::::- Petajoule:The petajoule (PJ) is equal to one quadrillion (10) joules. 210 PJ is about 50 megatons of TNT which is the amount of energy released by the Tsar Bomba, the largest man-made explosion ever.\nBULLET::::- Exajoule: The exajoule (EJ) is equal to one quintillion (10) joules. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan had 1.41 EJ of energy according to its rating of 9.0 on the moment magnitude scale. Yearly U.S. energy consumption amounts to roughly 94 EJ.\nBULLET::::- Zettajoule: The zettajoule (ZJ) is equal to one sextillion (10) joules. The human annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 ZJ.\nBULLET::::- Yottajoule: The yottajoule (YJ) is equal to one septillion (10) joules. This is approximately the amount of energy required to heat all the water on Earth by 1 °C. The thermal output of the Sun is approximately 400 YJ per second.\n\n1 joule is equal to (approximately unless otherwise stated):\nBULLET::::- (exactly)\nBULLET::::- (gram calories)\nBULLET::::- (food calories)\nBULLET::::- (foot-pound)\nBULLET::::- (foot-poundal)\nBULLET::::- (kilowatt-hour)\nBULLET::::- (watt-hour)\nBULLET::::- (litre-atmosphere)\nBULLET::::- (by way of mass-energy equivalence)\nBULLET::::- (exactly)\n\nUnits defined exactly in terms of the joule include:\nBULLET::::- 1 thermochemical calorie = 4.184J\nBULLET::::- 1 International Table calorie = 4.1868J\nBULLET::::- 1W⋅h = 3600J (or 3.6kJ)\nBULLET::::- 1kW⋅h = (or 3.6MJ)\nBULLET::::- 1W⋅s =\nBULLET::::- 1ton TNT =\n\nIn mechanics, the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analogue in the concept of torque (about some angle):\n\n! Linear !! Angular\n\nA result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre, which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name \"joule\", but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts. The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.\n\nThe distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar – the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector – the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation\n\nwhere \"E\" is energy, \"τ\" is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and \"θ\" is the angle swept (in radians). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.\n\nA watt second (also watt-second, symbol W s or W·s) is a derived unit of energy equivalent to the joule. The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one watt sustained for one second. While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term \"watt-second\" is used instead of \"joule\".\n\nIn photography, the unit for flashes is the watt-second. A flash can be rated in watt-seconds (e.g. 300 W⋅s) or in joules (different names for the same thing), but historically the term \"watt-second\" has been used and continues to be used. An on-camera flash, using a 1000 microfarad capacitor at 300 volts, would be 45 watt-seconds. Studio flashes, using larger capacitors and higher voltages, are in the 200–2000 watt-second range.\n\nThe energy rating a flash is given is not a reliable benchmark for its light output because there are numerous factors that affect the energy conversion efficiency. For example, the construction of the tube will affect the efficiency, and the use of reflectors and filters will change the usable light output towards the subject. Some companies specify their products in \"true\" watt-seconds, and some specify their products in \"nominal\" watt-seconds.\n\nBULLET::::- Fluence\n"}
{"id": "16328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16328", "title": "Jeepster Records", "text": "Jeepster Records\n\nJeepster Records is a London, England-based independent record label, founded in 1995, and specialising in British indie and alternative bands, particularly Glasgow-based acts. It is most notable for its signing of Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol.\n\nJeepster Records was founded in 1995 by Mark Jones and Stefano D’Andrea, through a mutual interest in the contemporary indie scene. Following their establishment and after extensive scouting, the label signed their first act, the newly formed Belle and Sebastian, in August 1996. In November of the same year, the band's first album with Jeepster, \"If You're Feeling Sinister\" was released. This put both Belle & Sebastian and Jeepster firmly on the map, and enabled them to release several EPs with Belle & Sebastian throughout 1997, as well as signing their second act, Snow Patrol, later in the year. 1998 then saw a further increase of activity, with the signing of Salako, and the release of albums for all three of their signed bands - most notably Belle & Sebastian's \"The Boy With The Arab Strap\".\n\nThe label's strong relationship with Belle & Sebastian enabled them in 1999 to sign Stuart David's side-project Looper, and Isobel Campbell's solo project The Gentle Waves, releasing albums for each that same year, along with a string of EPs and singles for their entire roster. The label enjoyed further good publicity when Belle & Sebastian won Best Newcomer in the 1999 Brit Awards. Later that year, Jeepster reissued Belle & Sebastian's debut album \"Tigermilk\", which had previously been available only on limited issue vinyl.\n\n2000 saw new albums released for Belle & Sebastian, Looper, and The Gentle Waves, as well as Belle & Sebastian's first appearance on \"Top of the Pops\". Towards the end of the year, the label released the \"It's a Cool Cool Christmas\" compilation in association with XFM, with proceeds going to The Big Issue charity. The album was only available during this Christmas period, and featured Belle & Sebastian and Snow Patrol, as well as numerous other bands such as The Flaming Lips and Teenage Fanclub. The following year finally marked the release of Snow Patrol's second album \"When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up\", which, despite slightly disappointing initial sales, would eventually go gold in the wake of the band's later fame, along with their debut \"Songs For Polarbears\".\n\nDespite critical acclaim for its acts, Jeepster nevertheless found itself financially troubled by 2002, largely due to increasing recording and marketing costs, and difficulty cultivating the images of their acts in the eye of the general public. This forced the label into a corner, and they had no choice but to decline renewal of the contracts of their most successful artists in order to continue producing the catalogue they had already built up. While they were neither able to retain their signed artists for this period, nor to consider signing new acts, the next few years nevertheless marked several additions to the catalogue. At this point, the running of the label came into the hands of Jo D'Andrea and Kay Heath.\n\nThe label released a Belle & Sebastian DVD in 2003, \"Fans Only\", and, in 2005, \"Push Barman to Open Old Wounds\", a compilation comprising all of Belle & Sebastian's singles and EPs released under Jeepster. This was followed in 2006 by re-releases of \"Songs for Polarbears\" and \"When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up\", including as-before unseen bonus tracks.\n\nFinding itself in a notably better state financially, in April 2006, Jeepster announced its first new signing in years, Reading-based act SixNationState. Following renewed scouting of the Glasgow underground scene, the label soon after announced the signing of another band, Parka, in November of the same year.\n\nFollowing several singles releases on behalf of both bands, the label released its first new album in six and a half years in late 2007 - SixNationState's self-titled debut album. In May 2008, Parka's own debut, \"Attack of the Hundred Yard Hardman\" was also released.\n\nBefore the end of 2008, Jeepster would also release another Belle & Sebastian compilation, \"The BBC Sessions\", collecting the tracks that the band had recorded for the BBC in 1996, which included rarities and unreleased songs, together with live recordings from Belfast.\n\nJeepster contributed six songs to the Polydor Records Snow Patrol compilation \"Up To Now\" in 2009.\n\nBULLET::::- \"If You're Feeling Sinister\" - Belle & Sebastian (1996)\nBULLET::::- \"Dog On Wheels\" - Belle & Sebastian (1997)\nBULLET::::- \"Lazy Line Painter Jane\" - Belle & Sebastian (1997)\nBULLET::::- \"3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light\" - Belle & Sebastian (1997)\nBULLET::::- \"Little Hide\" - Snow Patrol (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"100 Things You Should Have Done In Bed\" - Snow Patrol (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Growing Up In The Night\" - Salako (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Re-Inventing Punctuation\" - Salako (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Songs for Polarbears\" - Snow Patrol (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"The Boy with the Arab Strap\" - Belle & Sebastian (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Velocity Girl/Absolute Gravity\" - Snow Patrol (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"The Moonlight Radiates A Purple Glow In His World\" - Salako (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"This Is Just a Modern Rock Song\" - Belle & Sebastian (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Ballad Of Ray Suzuki\" - Looper (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Up A Tree\" - Looper (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Weathershow\" - The Gentle Waves (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"The Green Fields of Foreverland\" - The Gentle Waves (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"The Bird In The Bag\" - Salako (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Starfighter Pilot\" - Snow Patrol (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Tigermilk\" - Belle & Sebastian (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Musicality\" - Salako (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Mappleton Sands 20/12/98\" - Salako (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Who's Afraid Of Y2K\" - Looper (1999)\nBULLET::::- \"Mondo '77\" - Looper (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Ventimiglia 12/08/99\" - Salako (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"The Geometrid\" - Looper (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Legal Man\" - Belle & Sebastian (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant\" - Belle & Sebastian (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Falling from Grace\" - The Gentle Waves (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Ask Me How I Am\" - Snow Patrol (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Swansong for You\" - The Gentle Waves (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"It's a Cool Cool Christmas\" - Various Artists (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"One Night Is Not Enough\" - Snow Patrol (2001)\nBULLET::::- \"When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up\" - Snow Patrol (2001)\nBULLET::::- \"Jonathan David\" - Belle & Sebastian (2001)\nBULLET::::- \"I'm Waking Up To Us\" - Belle & Sebastian (2001)\nBULLET::::- \"Storytelling\" - Belle & Sebastian (2002)\nBULLET::::- \"Fans Only\" (DVD) - Belle & Sebastian (2003)\nBULLET::::- \"Push Barman to Open Old Wounds\" - Belle & Sebastian (2005)\nBULLET::::- \"Songs For Polarbears\" (reissue) - Snow Patrol (2006)\nBULLET::::- \"When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up\" (reissue) - Snow Patrol (2006)\nBULLET::::- \"Fire!\" - SixNationState (2006)\nBULLET::::- \"Where Are You Now?\" - SixNationState (2007)\nBULLET::::- \"If You Wanna?\" - Parka (2007)\nBULLET::::- \"We Could Be Happy\" - SixNationState (2007)\nBULLET::::- \"SixNationState\" - SixNationState (2007)\nBULLET::::- \"Disco Dancer\" - Parka (2008)\nBULLET::::- \"Better Anyway\" - Parka (2008)\nBULLET::::- \"Attack Of The Hundred Yard Hardman\" - Parka (2008)\nBULLET::::- \"The BBC Sessions\" - Belle & Sebastian (2008)\n\nBULLET::::- List of independent UK record labels\nBULLET::::- Lists of record labels\n\nBULLET::::- Official website\n"}
{"id": "16329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16329", "title": "John Chrysostom", "text": "John Chrysostom\n\nSaint John Chrysostom (; ; – 14 September 407), Archbishop of Constantinople, was an important Early Church Father. He is known for his preaching and public speaking, his denunciation of abuse of authority by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, the \"Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom\", and his ascetic sensibilities. The epithet (\"Chrysostomos\", anglicized as Chrysostom) means \"golden-mouthed\" in Greek and denotes his celebrated eloquence. Chrysostom was among the most prolific authors in the early Christian Church, exceeded only by Augustine of Hippo in the quantity of his surviving writings.\n\nHe is honoured as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, as well as in some others. The Eastern Orthodox, together with the Byzantine Catholics, hold him in special regard as one of the Three Holy Hierarchs (alongside Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus). The feast days of John Chrysostom in the Eastern Orthodox Church are 13 November and 27 January. In the Roman Catholic Church he is recognized as a Doctor of the Church. Because the date of his death is occupied by the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September), the General Roman Calendar celebrates him since 1970 on the previous day, 13 September; from the 13th century to 1969 it did so on 27 January, the anniversary of the translation of his body to Constantinople. Of other Western churches, including Anglican provinces and Lutheran churches, some commemorate him on 13 September, others on 27 January. The Coptic Church also recognizes him as a saint (with feast days on 16 Thout and 17 Hathor).\n\nJohn was born in Antioch in 347 to Greek parents from Syria. Different scholars describe his mother Anthusa as a pagan or as a Christian, and his father was a high-ranking military officer. John's father died soon after his birth and he was raised by his mother. He was baptised in 368 or 373 and tonsured as a reader (one of the minor orders of the Church). It is sometimes said that he was bitten by a snake when he was ten years old, leading to him getting an infection from the bite.\n\nAs a result of his mother's influential connections in the city, John began his education under the pagan teacher Libanius. From Libanius, John acquired the skills for a career in rhetoric, as well as a love of the Greek language and literature.\n\nAs he grew older, however, John became more deeply committed to Christianity and went on to study theology under Diodore of Tarsus, founder of the re-constituted School of Antioch. According to the Christian historian Sozomen, Libanius was supposed to have said on his deathbed that John would have been his successor \"if the Christians had not taken him from us\".\n\nJohn lived in extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375; he spent the next two years continually standing, scarcely sleeping, and committing the Bible to memory. As a consequence of these practices, his stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health forced him to return to Antioch.\n\nJohn was ordained as a deacon in 381 by Saint Meletius of Antioch who was not then in communion with Alexandria and Rome. After the death of Meletius, John separated himself from the followers of Meletius, without joining Paulinus, the rival of Meletius for the bishopric of Antioch. But after the death of Paulinus he was ordained a presbyter (priest) in 386 by Flavian, the successor of Paulinus. He was destined later to bring about reconciliation between Flavian I of Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome, thus bringing those three sees into communion for the first time in nearly seventy years.\n\nIn Antioch, over the course of twelve years (386–397), John gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking at the Golden Church, Antioch's cathedral, especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching. The most valuable of his works from this period are his \"Homilies\" on various books of the Bible. He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor. He spoke against abuse of wealth and personal property:Do you wish to honour the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked. Do not pay him homage in the temple clad in silk, only then to neglect him outside where he is cold and ill-clad. He who said: \"This is my body\" is the same who said: \"You saw me hungry and you gave me no food\", and \"Whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did also to me\"... What good is it if the Eucharistic table is overloaded with golden chalices when your brother is dying of hunger? Start by satisfying his hunger and then with what is left you may adorn the altar as well.\"\n\nHis straightforward understanding of the Scriptures – in contrast to the Alexandrian tendency towards allegorical interpretation – meant that the themes of his talks were practical, explaining the Bible's application to everyday life. Such straightforward preaching helped Chrysostom to garner popular support. He founded a series of hospitals in Constantinople to care for the poor.\n\nOne incident that happened during his service in Antioch illustrates the influence of his homilies. When Chrysostom arrived in Antioch, Flavian, the bishop of the city, had to intervene with Emperor Theodosius I on behalf of citizens who had gone on a rampage mutilating statues of the Emperor and his family. During the weeks of Lent in 387, John preached more than twenty homilies in which he entreated the people to see the error of their ways. These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city: many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the homilies. As a result, Theodosius' vengeance was not as severe as it might have been.\n\nIn the autumn of 397, John was appointed Archbishop of Constantinople, after having been nominated without his knowledge by the eunuch Eutropius. He had to leave Antioch in secret due to fears that the departure of such a popular figure would cause civil unrest.\n\nDuring his time as Archbishop he adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings, which made him popular with the common people, but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy. His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular. He told visiting regional preachers to return to the churches they were meant to be serving—without any payout.\n\nHis time in Constantinople was more tumultuous than his time in Antioch. Theophilus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John's appointment to Constantinople. Theophilus had disciplined four Egyptian monks (known as \"the Tall Brothers\") over their support of Origen's teachings. They fled to John and were welcomed by him. Theophilus therefore accused John of being too partial to the teaching of Origen. He made another enemy in Aelia Eudoxia, wife of Emperor Arcadius, who assumed that John's denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at her. Eudoxia, Theophilus and other of his enemies held a synod in 403 (the Synod of the Oak) to charge John, in which his connection to Origen was used against him. It resulted in his deposition and banishment. He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately, as the people became \"tumultuous\" over his departure, even threatening to burn the royal palace. There was an earthquake the night of his arrest, which Eudoxia took for a sign of God's anger, prompting her to ask Arcadius for John's reinstatement.\n\nPeace was short-lived. A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected in the Augustaion, near his cathedral. John denounced the dedication ceremonies as pagan and spoke against the Empress in harsh terms: \"Again Herodias raves; again she is troubled; she dances again; and again desires to receive John's head in a charger\", an allusion to the events surrounding the death of John the Baptist. Once again he was banished, this time to the Caucasus in Abkhazia.\n\nAround 405, John began to lend moral and financial support to Christian monks who were enforcing the emperors' anti-Pagan laws, by destroying temples and shrines in Phoenicia and nearby regions.\n\nThe causes of John's exile are not clear, though Jennifer Barry suggests that they have to do with his connections to Arianism. Other historians, including Wendy Mayer and Geoffrey Dunn, have argued that \"the surplus of evidence reveals a struggle between Johannite and anti-Johannite camps in Constantinople soon after John's departure and for a few years after his death\". Faced with exile, John Chrysostom wrote an appeal for help to three churchmen: Pope Innocent I, Venerius the Bishop of Milan, and the third to Chromatius, the Bishop of Aquileia. In 1872, church historian William Stephens wrote:\n\nThe Patriarch of the Eastern Rome appeals to the great bishops of the West, as the champions of an ecclesiastical discipline which he confesses himself unable to enforce, or to see any prospect of establishing. No jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the Old Rome by the Patriarch of the New Rome. The interference of Innocent is courted, a certain primacy is accorded him, but at the same time he is not addressed as a supreme arbitrator; assistance and sympathy are solicited from him as from an elder brother, and two other prelates of Italy are joint recipients with him of the appeal.\n\nPope Innocent I protested John's banishment from Constantinople to the town of Cucusus in Cappadocia, but to no avail. Innocent sent a delegation to intercede on behalf of John in 405. It was led by Gaudentius of Brescia; Gaudentius and his companions, two bishops, encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople.\n\nJohn wrote letters which still held great influence in Constantinople. As a result of this, he was further exiled from Cucusus (where he stayed from 404 to 407) to Pitiunt (Pityus) (in modern Georgia) where his tomb is a shrine for pilgrims. He never reached this destination, as he died at Comana Pontica on 14 September 407 during the journey. His last words are said to have been \"δόξα τῷ θεῷ πάντων ἕνεκεν\" (Glory be to God for all things).\n\nJohn came to be venerated as a saint soon after his death. Almost immediately after, an anonymous supporter of John (known as pseudo-Martyrius) wrote a funeral oration to reclaim John as a symbol of Christian orthodoxy. But three decades later, some of his adherents in Constantinople remained in schism. Saint Proclus, Patriarch of Constantinople (434–446), hoping to bring about the reconciliation of the Johannites, preached a homily praising his predecessor in the Church of Hagia Sophia. He said, \"O John, your life was filled with sorrow, but your death was glorious. Your grave is blessed and reward is great, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ O graced one, having conquered the bounds of time and place! Love has conquered space, unforgetting memory has annihilated the limits, and place does not hinder the miracles of the saint.\"\n\nThese homilies helped to mobilize public opinion, and the patriarch received permission from the emperor to return Chrysostom's relics to Constantinople, where they were enshrined in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 28 January 438. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as a \"Great Ecumenical Teacher\", with Basil the Great and Gregory the Theologian. These three saints, in addition to having their own individual commemorations throughout the year, are commemorated together on 30 January, a feast known as the Synaxis of the Three Hierarchs.\n\nThere are several feast days dedicated to him:\nBULLET::::- 27 January, Translation of the relics of Saint John Chrysostom from Comana to Constantinople\nBULLET::::- 30 January, Synaxis of the Three Great Hierarchs\nBULLET::::- 14 September, Repose of Saint John Chrysostom\nBULLET::::- 13 November, Saint John Chrysostom the Archbishop of Constantinople\n\nThe best known of his many homilies, the Paschal Homily (\"Hieratikon\"), is rather brief. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is traditionally read in full each year at the Paschal Divine Liturgy (eucharistic) service following the midnight Orthros (or Matins).\n\nChrysostom's extant homiletical works are vast, including many hundreds of exegetical homilies on both the New Testament (especially the works of Saint Paul) and the Old Testament (particularly on Genesis). Among his extant exegetical works are sixty-seven homilies on Genesis, fifty-nine on the Psalms, ninety on the Gospel of Matthew, eighty-eight on the Gospel of John, and fifty-five on the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nThe homilies were written down by stenographers and subsequently circulated, revealing a style that tended to be direct and greatly personal, but formed by the rhetorical conventions of his time and place. In general, his homiletical theology displays much characteristic of the Antiochian school (i.e., somewhat more literal in interpreting Biblical events), but he also uses a good deal of the allegorical interpretation more associated with the Alexandrian school.\n\nJohn's social and religious world was formed by the continuing and pervasive presence of paganism in the life of the city. One of his regular topics was the paganism in the culture of Constantinople, and in his homilies he thunders against popular pagan amusements: the theatre, horseraces, and the revelry surrounding holidays. In particular, he criticizes Christians for taking part in such activities:\nOne of the recurring features of John's homilies is his emphasis on care for the needy. Echoing themes found in the Gospel of Matthew, he calls upon the rich to lay aside materialism in favor of helping the poor, often employing all of his rhetorical skills to shame wealthy people to abandon conspicuous consumption:\n\nDuring his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386–387), John denounced Jews and Judaizing Christians in a series of eight homilies delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances. It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general. His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, utilizing the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the \"psogos\" (Greek: blame, censure).\n\nOne of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom's flock. In his homilies, John criticized those \"Judaizing Christians\", who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as the shabbat, submitted to circumcision and made pilgrimage to Jewish holy places.\n\nJohn claimed that synagogues were full of Christians, especially Christian women, on the shabbats and Jewish festivals, because they loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy and enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom. A more recent theory is that he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians, who for centuries had kept connections with Jews and Judaism, to choose between Judaism and Christianity.\n\nIn Greek the homilies are called \"Kata Ioudaiōn\" (\"Κατὰ Ἰουδαίων\"), which is translated as \"Adversus Judaeos\" in Latin and \"Against the Jews\" in English. The original Benedictine editor of the homilies, Bernard de Montfaucon, gives the following footnote to the title: \"A discourse against the Jews; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them [the Jews].\"\n\nAccording to Patristics scholars, opposition to any particular view during the late 4th century was conventionally expressed in a manner, utilizing the rhetorical form known as the psogos, whose literary conventions were to vilify opponents in an uncompromising manner; thus, it has been argued that to call Chrysostom an \"anti-Semite\" is to employ anachronistic terminology in a way incongruous with historical context and record. This does not preclude assertions that Chrysostom's theology was a form of Anti-Jewish supersessionism.\n\nChristian priest James Parkes called Chrysostom's writing on Jews \"the most horrible and violent denunciations of Judaism to be found in the writings of a Christian theologian\". According to historian William I. Brustein, his sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. Steven Katz cites Chrysostom's homilies as “the decisive turn in the history of Christian anti-Judaism, a turn whose ultimate disfiguring consequence was enacted in the political antisemitism of Adolf Hitler.”\n\nAccording to Robert H. Allen, \"Chrysostom's learning and eloquence spans and sums up a long age of ever-growing moral outrage, fear and loathing of homosexuality.\" His most notable discourse in this regard is his fourth homily on , where he argues that those who have sex with the same sex must do so because they are insane: All of these affections then were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored than the body in diseases. ... [The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more shame than men. \n\nHe describes homosexuality as the worst of sins, greater than murder. He asserts that punishment will be found in hell for such transgressors, and that women can be guilty of the sin as much as men. Chrysostom argues that the male passive partner has effectively renounced his manhood and become a woman – such an individual deserves to be \"driven out and stoned\". He attributes the cause to \"luxury\". \"Do not, he means (Paul), because you have heard that they burned, suppose that the evil was only in desire. For the greater part of it came out their luxuriousness, which also kindled their flame into lust.\" \n\nAccording to scholar Michael Carden, Chrysostom was particularly influential in shaping early Christian thought that same-sex desire was an evil that ultimately resulted in social injustice – altering the traditional interpretation of Sodom as a place of inhospitality, to one where the sexual transgressions of the Sodomites became paramount. Allen describes the sermon as the \"climax and consummation of homophobia in the late classical world\".\n\nApart from his homilies, a number of John's other treatises have had a lasting influence. One such work is John's early treatise \"Against Those Who Oppose the Monastic Life\", written while he was a deacon (sometime before 386), which was directed to parents, pagan as well as Christian, whose sons were contemplating a monastic vocation. Chrysostom wrote that, already in his day, it was customary for Antiochenes to send their sons to be educated by monks.\n\nAnother important treatise written by John is titled \"On the Priesthood\" (written 390/391, it contains in Book 1 an account of his early years and a defence of his flight from ordination by Bishop Meletios of Antioch, and then proceeds in later books to expound on his exalted understanding of the priesthood). Two other notable books by John are \"Instructions to Catechumens\" and \"On the Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature\". In addition, he wrote a series of letters to the deaconess Olympias, of which seventeen are extant.\n\nBeyond his preaching, the other lasting legacy of John is his influence on Christian liturgy. Two of his writings are particularly notable. He harmonized the liturgical life of the Church by revising the prayers and rubrics of the Divine Liturgy, or celebration of the Holy Eucharist. To this day, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite typically celebrate the \"Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom\" as the normal Eucharistic liturgy, although his exact connection with it remains a matter of debate among experts.\n\nDuring a time when city clergy were subject to criticism for their high lifestyle, John was determined to reform his clergy in Constantinople. These efforts were met with resistance and limited success. He was an excellent preacher whose homilies and writings are still studied and quoted. As a theologian, he has been and continues to be very important in Eastern Christianity, and is generally considered among the Three Holy Hierarchs of the Greek Church, but has been less important to Western Christianity. His writings have survived to the present day more so than any of the other Greek Fathers.\n\nJohn's influence on church teachings is interwoven throughout the current Catechism of the Catholic Church (revised 1992). The Catechism cites him in eighteen sections, particularly his reflections on the purpose of prayer and the meaning of the Lord's Prayer:\n\nChristian clerics, such as R. S. Storr, refer to him as \"one of the most eloquent preachers who ever since apostolic times have brought to men the divine tidings of truth and love\", and the 19th-century John Henry Newman described John as a \"bright, cheerful, gentle soul; a sensitive heart\".\n\nJohn's liturgical legacy has inspired several musical compositions. Particularly noteworthy are Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom\", Op. 31, composed in 1910, one of his two major unaccompanied choral works; Pyotr Tchaikovsky's \"Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom\", Op. 41; and Ukrainian composer Kyrylo Stetsenko's Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. Arvo Pärt's \"Litany\" sets Chrysostom's twenty-four prayers, one for each hour of the day, for soli, mixed choir and orchestra. And the compositions of Alexander Grechaninovs \"Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos No. 1, Op. 13 (1897)\", \"Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos No. 2, Op.29 (1902)\", \"Liturgia Domestica (Liturgy Johannes Chrysostomos No. 3), Op. 79 (1917)\" and \"Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos No. 4, Op. 177 (1943)\" are noteworthy.\n\nJames Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\" includes a character named Mulligan who brings 'Chrysostomos' into another character (Stephen Dedalus)'s mind because Mulligan's gold-stopped teeth and his gift of the gab earn him the title which St. John Chrysostom's preaching earned him, 'golden-mouthed': \"\"[Mulligan] peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos.\"\"\n\nA late medieval legend (not included in the Golden Legend) relates that, when John Chrysostom was a hermit in the desert, he was approached by a royal princess in distress. The Saint, thinking she was a demon, at first refused to help her, but the princess convinced him that she was a Christian and would be devoured by wild beasts if she were not allowed to enter his cave. He therefore admitted her, carefully dividing the cave in two parts, one for each of them. In spite of these precautions, the sin of fornication was committed, and in an attempt to hide it the distraught saint took the princess and threw her over a precipice. He then went to Rome to beg absolution, which was refused. Realising the appalling nature of his crimes, Chrysostom made a vow that he would never rise from the ground until his sins were expiated, and for years he lived like a beast, crawling on all fours and feeding on wild grasses and roots. Subsequently, the princess reappeared, alive, and suckling the saint's baby, who miraculously pronounced his sins forgiven. This last scene was very popular from the late 15th century onwards as a subject for engravers and artists. The theme was depicted by Albrecht Dürer around 1496, Hans Sebald Beham and Lucas Cranach the Elder, among others. Martin Luther mocked this same legend in his \"Die Lügend von S. Johanne Chrysostomo\" (1537). The legend was recorded in Croatia in the 16th century.\n\nJohn Chrysostom died in the city of Comana in the year 407 on his way to his place of exile. There his relics remained until 438 when, thirty years after his death, they were transferred to Constantinople during the reign of the Empress Eudoxia's son, the Emperor Theodosius II (408–450), under the guidance of John's disciple, St. Proclus, who by that time had become Archbishop of Constantinople (434–447).\n\nMost of John's relics were looted from Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and taken to Rome, but some of his bones were returned to the Orthodox Church on 27 November 2004 by Pope John Paul II. They are now enshrined in the Church of St. George, Istanbul.\n\nThe skull, however, having been kept at the monastery at Vatopedi on Mount Athos in northern Greece, was not among the relics that were taken by the crusaders in the 13th century. In 1655, at the request of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, the skull was taken to Russia, for which the monastery was compensated in the sum of 2000 rubles. In 1693, having received a request from the Vatopedi Monastery for the return of Saint John's skull, Tsar Peter the Great ordered that the skull remain in Russia but that the monastery was to be paid 500 rubles every four years. The Russian state archives document these payments up until 1735. The skull was kept at the Moscow Kremlin, in the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God, until 1920, when it was confiscated by the Soviets and placed in the Museum of Silver Antiquities. In 1988, in connection with the 1000th Anniversary of the Baptism of Russia, the head, along with other important relics, was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church and kept at the Epiphany Cathedral, until being moved to the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour after its restoration.\n\nToday, the monastery at Vatopedi posits a rival claim to possessing the skull of John Chrysostom, and there a skull is venerated by pilgrims to the monastery as that of Saint John. Two sites in Italy also claim to have the saint's skull: the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence and the \"Dal Pozzo\" chapel in Pisa. The right hand of Saint John is preserved on Mount Athos, and numerous smaller relics are scattered throughout the world.\n\nBULLET::::- Allen, Pauline and Mayer, Wendy (2000). \"John Chrysostom\".

{"id": "16333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16333", "title": "James Heckman", "text": "James Heckman\n\nJames Joseph Heckman (born 1944) is a Nobel Prize winning American economist who is currently at the University of Chicago, where he is The Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and the College; Professor at the Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies; Director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD); and Co-Director of Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO) Global Working Group. He is also Professor of Law at the Law School, a senior research fellow at the American Bar Foundation, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. In 2000, Heckman shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Daniel McFadden, for his pioneering work in econometrics and microeconomics. As of February 2019 (according to RePEc), he is the next most influential economist in the world.\n\nHeckman was born to John Jacob Heckman and Bernice Irene Medley in Chicago, Illinois. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Colorado College (1965) and his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University (1971), under the supervision of Stanley W. Black.\n\nHe served as an assistant professor at Columbia University before he moved to the University of Chicago, in 1973. He has been a dissertation advisor for over 70 students, including Carolyn Heinrich, George Borjas, Stephen Cameron, Mark Rosenzweig, and Russ Roberts.\n\nIn addition to serving as the Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor and director of the Economics Research Center in the department of economics, Heckman is also a professor of law at the Law School and a professor in the Irving B. Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago where he is the director of both the Center for Social Program Evaluation and Center for the Study of Childhood Development. He also serves as a member of the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics's Research Council. Heckman has held many appointments at other institutions and notably served as the Distinguished Chair of Microeconometrics at University College London (2004-2008), a Professor of Science and Society at University College Dublin (2005-2014), and as the Alfred Cowles Distinguished Visiting Professor at Yale University (2008-2011). His current appointments include Presidential Scholar-in-Residence at the University of Southern California's Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics (2015-) and International Research Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (2014-).\n\nFounded in 2014 and directed by Heckman, the Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), at the University of Chicago, umbrellas his multiple research areas and initiatives that encompass rigorous empirical research to determine effective human capital policies and program design. CEHD initiatives include the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development, the Heckman Equation, the Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes, and the Asian Family in Transition Initiative. Along with professor Steve Durlauf, Heckman is the Co-Director of the HCEO Working Group.\n\nHeckman is noted for his contributions to selection bias and self-selection analysis, especially Heckman correction, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in labor economics, particularly regarding the efficacy of early childhood education programs.\n\nHis work has been devoted to the development of a scientific basis for economic policy evaluation, with special emphasis on models of individuals and disaggregated groups, and the problems and possibilities created by heterogeneity, diversity, and unobserved counterfactual states. He developed a body of new econometric tools that address these issues. His research has given policymakers important new insights into areas such as education, jobtraining, the importance of accounting for general equilibrium in the analysis of labor markets, anti-discrimination law, and civil rights. He demonstrated a strong causal effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in promoting African-American economic progress. He has recently demonstrated that the high school dropout rate is increasing in the US. He has studied the economic benefits of sorting in the labor market, the ineffectiveness of active labor market programs, and the economic returns to education.\n\nHis recent research focuses on inequality, human development and lifecycle skill formation, with a special emphasis on the economics of early childhood education. He is currently conducting new social experiments on early childhood interventions and reanalyzing old experiments. He is also studying the emergence of the underclass in the US and Western Europe. For example, he showed that a high IQ only improved an individual's chances of financial success by 1 or 2%. Instead, \"conscientiousness,\" or \"diligence, perseverance and self-discipline,\" are what lead to financial success.\n\nIn the early 1990s, his pioneering research, on the outcomes of people who obtain the GED certificate, received national attention.\n\nHeckman has published over 300 articles and several books. His books include \"Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policy?\" (with Alan Krueger); \"Evaluating Human Capital Policy, Law, and Employment: Lessons from Latin America and the Caribbean\" (with Carmen Pages); the \"Handbook of Econometrics\", volumes 5, 6A, and 6B (edited with Edward Leamer); \"Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law,\" (edited with R. Nelson and L. Cabatingan); and \"The Myth of Achievement Tests: The GED and the Role of Character in American Life\" (with John Eric Humphries and Tim Kautz).\n\nHe is currently co-editor of the \"Journal of Political Economy\". He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) and the American Philosophical Society. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Econometric Society (of which he is also former president), the Society of Labor Economics, the American Statistical Association, and the International Statistical Institute.\n\nHeckman has received numerous awards for his work, including the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association in 1983, the 2005 and 2007 Dennis Aigner Award for Applied Econometrics from the \"Journal of Econometrics\", the 2005 Jacob Mincer Award for Lifetime Achievement in Labor Economics, the 2005 Ulysses Medal from the University College Dublin, the 2007 Theodore W. Schultz Award from the American Agricultural Economics Association, the Gold Medal of the President of the Italian Republic awarded by the International Scientific Committee of the Pio Manzú Centre in 2008, the Distinguished Contributions to Public Policy for Children Award from the Society for Research in Child Development in 2009, the 2014 Frisch Medal from the Econometric Society, the 2014 Spirit of Erikson Award from the Erikson Institute, and the 2016 Dan David Prize for Combating Poverty from Tel Aviv University.\n\nHeckman is married to sociologist Lynne Pettler-Heckman with whom he has two children: a son, Jonathan (b. 1982) who is a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, and a daughter, Alma (b. 1986), who is an assistant professor of history at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nBULLET::::- List of economists\nBULLET::::- List of think tanks\n\nBULLET::::- James J.

{"id": "16334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16334", "title": "Judith of Poland", "text": "Judith of Poland\n\nJudith of Poland (, , ; b. 1130/35 – died 8 July 1171/75), was a Polish princess member of the House of Piast and by marriage Margravine of Brandenburg.\n\nShe was the daughter of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife Salomea, daughter of Henry, Count of Berg. She was probably named after either her paternal grandmother, Judith of Bohemia or her older half-sister, Princess consort of Murom.\n\nJudith was one of the youngest children of her parents; her date of birth remains unknown. According to Polish medieval chronicles, she was sent to Hungary as a bride of the son of King Béla II. According to the \"Annales Cracovienses Compilati\", this event took place in 1136; since it can be assumed that the Polish princess was younger than her betrothed, and also are known the birth dates of the youngest children of Bolesław III (Agnes in 1137 and Casimir in 1138), Judith in consequence could have been born between 1130 and 1135.\n\nThe marriage never took place: by 1146, the engagement was broken with the consent of both parties and Judith returned to Poland. The reason for this may have been the wedding of Mieszko (Judith's brother) with the Hungarian princess Elisabeth (daughter of King Béla II), which sufficiently secured the Polish-Hungarian alliance.\n\nIn Kruszwica on 6 January 1148 Judith married Otto, eldest son of Albert the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg. This union was contracted in connection with the Ascanian efforts to support the Junior Dukes in opposition to King Conrad III of Germany, who supported the deposed High Duke Władysław II as legal ruler of Poland. During her marriage, she bore her husband two sons, Otto (who later succeeded his father as Margrave of Brandenburg) in 1149, and Henry (who inherited the Counties of Tangermünde and Gardelegen) in 1150.\n\nNothing is known about the political role that Judith had to play in Germany. After his father's death in 1170, Otto became the second Margrave of Brandenburg and Judith the Margravine consort.\n\nLike her birth date, Judith's date of death remains unknown. Only the day, 8 July, is known thanks to the \"Regesta Historia Brandenburgensis\", which records the death in \"\"VIII Id Jul\"\" of \"\"Juditha marchionissa gemma Polonorum\"\". By contrast, the year of death can be determined only through indirect sources. In documents from 1170 Judith is named as a living person, but according to chronicles from 1177 her husband Otto I was already married to his second wife, Ada of Holland. On this basis, it is assumed that Judith died between 1171 and 1175. She was buried in the Brandenburg Cathedral.\n\nJudith's oldest son, Otto II, inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg after the death of his father in 1184. He never married or had children; because his brother Henry died before him (in 1192) also without issue, after Otto II's death in 1205 Brandenburg was inherited by his younger half-brother Albert II, son of Otto I and Ada.\n"}
{"id": "16336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16336", "title": "Jeffrey Archer", "text": "Jeffrey Archer\n\nJeffrey Howard Archer (born 15 April 1940) is an English novelist, former politician, and peer of the realm.\n\nBefore becoming an author, Archer was a Member of Parliament (1969–1974), but did not seek re-election after a financial scandal that left him almost bankrupt. He revived his fortunes as a best-selling novelist; his books have sold around 330 million copies worldwide.\n\nArcher became deputy chairman of the Conservative Party (1985–86), before resigning after a newspaper accused him of paying money to a prostitute. In 1987, he won a court case and was awarded large damages because of this claim. He was made a life peer in 1992 and subsequently became Conservative candidate to be the first elected Mayor of London. He had to resign his candidacy in 1999 after it emerged that he had lied in his 1987 libel case. He was imprisoned (2001–03) for perjury and perverting the course of justice, ending his elected political career.\n\nJeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital in Finsbury and his birth was registered in the June quarter of 1940. He was two weeks old when his family moved to Somerset, eventually settling in the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, where Archer spent most of his early life. His father, William (died 1956), was 64 years old when Jeffrey Archer was born. Early in his career, Archer gave conflicting accounts to the press of his father's supposed, but non-existent, military career. William Archer was, in fact, a bigamist, fraudster and conman, who impersonated another William Archer, a deceased war medal holder. He was at different times employed as a chewing gum salesman in New York and a mortgage broker in London. In the latter capacity he was charged at the Old Bailey for a series of fraud offences. On being allowed bail, he absconded to America under the name William Grimwood. As a boy Archer dreamt about being captain of Bristol Rovers Football Club, and is still a fan of the club.\n\nIn 1951, Archer won a scholarship to Wellington School in Somerset, not to the more prestigious Wellington College in Berkshire, as he was later inclined to claim. At this time his mother, Lola, was employed as a journalist on Weston's local newspaper, the Weston Mercury. She wrote a weekly column entitled \"Over the Teacups\", and frequently wrote about Jeffrey, calling him 'Tuppence'. Although Archer enjoyed the local fame this brought him, it caused him to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School.\n\nArcher left school with O-levels in English literature, art and history. He then spent a few years in a variety of jobs, including training with the army and a short period with the Metropolitan Police. He later worked as a physical education teacher, first at Vicar's Hill, a preparatory school in Hampshire, and later at Dover College in Kent.\n\nIn 1963 Archer was offered a place at the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education to study for a Diploma of Education. The course was based in the department, and Archer became a member of Brasenose College. There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications to Brasenose College, for instance, the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, in gaining admission to the course. It has also been alleged Archer provided false statements about three non-existent A-level passes and a U.S. university degree. Although the diploma course only lasted a year, Archer spent a total of three years at Oxford.\n\nAt Oxford Archer was successful in athletics, competing in sprinting and hurdling, and became president of the Oxford University Athletic Club. Television coverage survives of him making false starts in a 1964 sprint race, but he was not disqualified. He gained a blue in athletics and went on to run for England, and once successfully competed for Great Britain.\n\nEven as a student Jeffrey Archer was plagued with rumours of financial wrongdoing — fellow undergraduates were amazed that he owned houses and cars with personalised number plates while working part time as an Oxfam fund raiser.\n\nArcher raised money for the charity Oxfam, obtaining the support of The Beatles in a charity fundraising drive. The band accepted his invitation to visit the Principal's lodge at Brasenose College, where they were photographed with Archer and dons of the college, although they did not play there. The critic Sheridan Morley, then a student at Merton, was present and recalled the occasion: \n\nAfter leaving Oxford, Archer continued as a charity fundraiser, initially working for the National Birthday Trust, a medical charity that promoted safe childbirth, before joining the United Nations Association (UNA) as its chief fundraiser. The then chairman of the UNA, Humphry Berkeley, alleged that there were numerous discrepancies in Archer's expense claims whilst he worked at the UNA.\n\nAround this time, Archer began a career in politics, serving as a Conservative councillor on the Greater London Council (1967–1970).\n\nArcher set up his own fundraising and public relations company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later.\n\nAt 29, Archer was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. The national party had concerns about Archer's selection, specifically relating to the UNA expenses allegations made by Humphry Berkeley, himself a former Conservative MP. Berkeley tried to persuade Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate. However, Archer brought a defamation action against Berkeley and the story was kept out of the press, although a truncated version of the story did appear in \"The Times\". The case was eventually settled out of court, with Archer agreeing to pay the legal costs of around £30,000.\n\nLouth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham. During his time as an MP, Archer was a regular at the Immingham Conservative Club in the most working-class part of the constituency. In 1970 he took part in the Kennedy Memorial Test, a 50-mile running/walking race from Louth to Skegness and back.\n\nIn parliament, Archer was on the left of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies. He advocated free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. In 1971, he employed David Mellor to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview in February 1999 Archer said, \"I hope we don't return to extremes. I'm what you might call centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing.\"\n\nIn 1974 Archer was a casualty of a fraudulent investment scheme involving a Canadian company called Aquablast. The debacle lost him his first fortune and left him almost £500,000 in debt. Fearing imminent bankruptcy, he stood down as an MP at the October 1974 general election.\n\nWhile he was a witness in the Aquablast case in Toronto in 1975, Archer was accused of stealing three suits from a department store. Archer denied the accusation for many years, but in the late 1990s he finally acknowledged that he had taken the suits, although he claimed that at the time he had not realised he had left the shop. No charges were ever brought.\n\nArcher wrote his first book, \"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\", in the autumn of 1974, as a means of avoiding bankruptcy. The book was picked up by the literary agent Deborah Owen and published first in the U.S., then eventually in Britain in the autumn of 1976. A radio adaptation was aired on BBC Radio 4 in the early 1980s and a BBC Television adaptation of the book was broadcast in 1990.\n\n\"Kane and Abel\" (1979) proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on \"The New York Times\" bestsellers list. Like most of his early work it was edited by Richard Cohen, the Olympic fencing gold-medallist. It was made into a television mini-series by CBS in 1985, starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill. The following year, Granada TV screened a 10-part adaptation of another Archer bestseller, \"First Among Equals\", which told the story of four men and their quest to become Prime Minister. In the U.S. edition of the novel, the character of Andrew Fraser was eliminated, reducing the number of protagonists to three.\n\nAs well as novels and short stories, Archer has also written three stage plays. The first, \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\", opened in 1987 and ran at the Queen's Theatre in London's West End for over a year. However, Archer's next play, \"Exclusive\", was not well received by critics, and closed after a few weeks. His final play, \"The Accused\", opened at the Theatre Royal, Windsor on 26 September 2000, before transferring to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in the West End in December.\n\nIn 1988 author Kathleen Burnett accused Archer of plagiarising a story she'd written and including it in his short-story collection, \"A Twist in the Tale\". Archer denied he had plagiarised the story, claiming he'd simply been inspired by the idea.\n\nWhilst Archer's books are commercially successful, critics have been generally unfavourable towards his writing. However, journalist Hugo Barnacle, writing for \"The Independent\" about \"The Fourth Estate\" (1996), thought the novel, while demonstrating that \"the editors don't seem to have done any work\", was \"not wholly unsatisfactory\".\n\nArcher has said that he spends considerable time writing and re-writing each book. He goes abroad to write the first draft, working in blocks of two hours at a time, then writes anything up to 17 drafts in total. Since 2010, Archer has written the first draft of each new book at his luxury villa in Majorca, called \"Writer's Block\".\n\nIn 2011, Archer published the first of seven books in \"The Clifton Chronicles\" series, which follow the life of Harry Clifton from his birth in 1920, through to his funeral in 1993. The first novel in the series, \"Only Time Will Tell\", tells the story of Harry from 1920 through to 1940, and was published in the UK on 12 May 2011. The seventh and final novel in the series, \"This Was a Man\", was published on 3 November 2016.\n\nArcher's latest novel, \"Nothing Ventured\", was published in September 2019, and is the first in a new series featuring detective William Warwick.\n\nArcher's political career revived in the 1980s, and he became a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985. Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Ted Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing moments, including his statement, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer's comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3.4 million. Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, saying that his words had been \"taken out of context\". Archer resigned as deputy chairman in October 1986 due to a scandal caused by an article in \"The News of the World\", which led on the story \"Tory boss Archer pays vice-girl\" and claimed Archer had paid Monica Coghlan, a prostitute, £2,000 through an intermediary at Victoria Station to go abroad.\n\nShortly after \"The News of the World\" story broke, rival tabloid the \"Daily Star\" ran a story alleging Archer had paid for sex with Coghlan, something \"The News of the World\" had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the \"Daily Star\". The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather than that of a guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: \"Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?\" The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, \"Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?\"\n\nAlthough the Archers claimed they were a normal, happily-married couple, by this time, according to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives. The editor of the \"Daily Star\", Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling to take the risk of a potentially costly libel case. \"The News of the World\" later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him.\n\nWhen Saddam Hussein suppressed Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, with the Red Cross, set up the charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign on behalf of the Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed for free. Archer claimed that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later revealed that only £3 million came from the Simple Truth concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later result in further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, \"of Mark in the County of Somerset\". Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.\n\nIn a speech at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to \"Stand and deliver,\" saying: \"Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and grandparents walked with freedom ... We say to you: stand and deliver!\". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of \"do-gooders\" and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.\n\nOn \"Question Time\" on 20 January 1994, Archer said that 18 should be the age of consent for gay sex, as opposed to 21, which it was at the time. Archer though was opposed to the age of consent for gay men being 16. Historian David Starkey was on the same edition, and said of Archer: \"Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.\" Archer has also consistently been an opponent of a return to capital punishment.\n\nIn January 1994, Mary Archer, then a director of Anglia Television, attended a directors' meeting at which an impending takeover of Anglia Television by MAI, which owned Meridian Broadcasting, was discussed. The following day, Jeffrey Archer bought 50,000 shares in Anglia Television, acting on behalf of a friend, Broosk Saib. Shortly after this, it was announced publicly that Anglia Television would be taken over by MAI. As a result, the shares jumped in value, whereupon Archer sold them on behalf of his friend for a profit of £77,219. The arrangements he made with the stockbrokers meant he did not have to pay at the time of buying the shares.\n\nAn inquiry was launched by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading. The Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Michael Heseltine, announced that Archer would not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. His solicitors admitted that he had made a mistake, but Archer later said that he had been exonerated.\n\nIn 1999, Archer had been selected by the Conservative Party as candidate for the London mayoral election of 2000, with the support of two former Prime Ministers, Baroness Thatcher and John Major. Eight Conservative ex-Cabinet Ministers who had been in office during the Thatcher and Major governments wrote to \"The Daily Telegraph\" in support of Archer's candidature. However, on 21 November 1999 the \"News of the World\" published allegations made by Ted Francis, a former friend of Archer's, that Archer had committed perjury in his 1987 libel case. Archer withdrew his candidature the following day. After the allegations, Archer was disowned by his party. Conservative leader William Hague explained: \"\"This is the end of politics for Jeffrey Archer. I will not tolerate such behaviour in my party.\"\" On 4 February 2000, Archer was expelled from the party for five years.\n\nOn 26 September 2000, Archer was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice during the 1987 libel trial. Ted Francis was charged with perverting the course of justice. Simultaneously, Archer starred in a production of his own courtroom play \"The Accused\", staged at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket. The play concerned the court trial of an alleged murderer and assigned the role of jury to the audience, which would vote on the guilt of Archer's character at the end of each performance.\n\nThe perjury trial began on 30 May 2001, a month after Monica Coghlan's death in a road traffic collision. Ted Francis claimed that Archer had asked him to provide a false alibi for the night Archer was alleged to have been with Monica Coghlan. Angela Peppiatt, Archer's former personal assistant, also claimed Archer had fabricated an alibi in the 1987 trial. Peppiatt had kept a diary of Archer's movements, which contradicted evidence given during the 1987 trial. Andrina Colquhoun, Archer's former mistress, confirmed that they had been having an affair in the 1980s, thus contradicting the claim that he and Mary Archer had been “happily married” at the time of the trial.\n\nArcher never spoke during the trial, though his wife Mary again gave evidence as she had done during the 1987 trial. On 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by Mr Justice Potts. Francis was found not guilty. Prominent journalists admitted to having accepted Archer's hospitality after he was convicted. Archer's mother had died shortly before he was sentenced and he was released for the day to attend her funeral.\n\nArcher was initially sent to Belmarsh Prison, a Category \"A\" prison, but was moved to Wayland Prison, a Category \"C\" prison in Norfolk, on 9 August 2001. Despite automatically qualifying as a category \"D\" prisoner given it was a first conviction and he did not pose serious risk of harm to the public, his status as such was suspended pending a police investigation into allegations about his Kurdish charity. He was then transferred to HM Prison North Sea Camp, an open prison, in October 2001. From there he was let out to work at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, and allowed occasional home visits.\n\nMedia reports claimed he had been abusing this privilege by attending lunches with friends, including former Education Secretary Gillian Shephard. In September 2002 he was transferred to a Category \"B\" prison, Lincoln. After three weeks, he was moved to the Category \"D\" HM Prison Hollesley Bay in Suffolk.\n\nDuring his imprisonment, Archer was visited by a number of high-profile friends, including actor Donald Sinden and performer Barry Humphries, better known as Dame Edna Everage.\n\nIn October 2002, Archer repaid the \"Daily Star\" the £500,000 damages he had received in 1987, as well as legal costs and interest of £1.3 million. That month, he was suspended from Marylebone Cricket Club for seven years.\n\nOn 21 July 2003, Archer was released on licence from Hollesley Bay after serving half of his sentence.\nHe remained a peer, there being no legal provision through which it could be removed other than passing a new Act of Parliament. He also retained membership of the House of Lords, which did not then have the power to expel members; however, Archer has not taken an active part in the proceedings of the House. Politically he is a non-affiliated member.\n\nWhile in prison, Archer wrote the three-volume memoir \"A Prison Diary\", with volumes fashioned after Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" and named after the first three prisons in which he was kept. His prison term also served as inspiration for nine of the 12 short stories in the collection, \"Cat O' Nine Tales\".\n\nIn July 2001, shortly after Archer was jailed for perjury, Scotland Yard began investigating allegations that millions of pounds had disappeared from his Kurdish charity. In 1991, Archer had claimed to have raised £57,042,000. In 1992, the Kurdish Disaster Fund had written to Archer, complaining: \"You must be concerned that the Kurdish refugees have seen hardly any of the huge sums raised in the west in their name.\" Kurdish groups claimed little more than £250,000 had been received by groups in Iraq.\n\nA British Red Cross-commissioned KPMG audit of the cash showed no donations were handled by Archer and any misappropriation was \"unlikely\", however KPMG also could find no evidence to support Archer's claims to have raised £31.5 million from overseas governments. The police said they would launch a \"preliminary assessment of the facts\" from the audit but were not investigating the Simple Truth fund.\n\nIn 2004, the government of Equatorial Guinea alleged that Archer was one of the financiers of the failed 2004 coup d'état attempt against it, citing bank details and telephone records as evidence. In 2009, Archer said: \"I am completely relaxed about it. Mr Mann [Simon Mann, the English mercenary leader of the coup] has made clear that it's nothing to do with me.\" In 2011, Mann, imprisoned in Equatorial Guinea for his role in leading the failed 2004 coup d'état but released on humanitarian grounds later, told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that his forthcoming book, \"Cry Havoc\", would reveal \"the financial involvement of a controversial and internationally famous member of the British House of Lords in the plot, backed up by banking records.\" He claimed documents from the bank accounts in Guernsey of two companies Mann used as vehicles for organising the coup, showed a 'J H Archer' paying $135,000 into one of the firms.\n\nArcher has been married to Mary Weeden since July 1966. They met at Oxford University, where Weeden was studying chemistry at St Anne's College. She went on to specialise in solar power.\n\nThey have two children: William Archer (born 1972), a theatre producer, and James Archer (born 1974), a financial adviser and businessman.\n\nMary Archer has said that she does not consider sexual fidelity to be an important factor in a successful marriage, suggesting that friendship and loyalty are more important qualities. She has often commented that Jeffrey has \"a gift for inaccurate precis\".\n\nIn 1979 the Archers purchased the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke. Every summer, they host a lavish garden party in the grounds to celebrate their wedding anniversary. By the early 1980s Archer was back in a comfortable financial position and began to hold shepherd's pie and Krug parties for prominent people at his London apartment, which overlooks the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament.\n\nOn 26 February 2006, on Andrew Marr's \"Sunday AM\" programme, Archer said he had no interest in returning to front-line politics and would pursue his writing instead.\n\nArcher was satirically portrayed as a misunderstood secret agent, saviour of Britain and mankind and \"overall thoroughly good chap\", by actor Damian Lewis in the BBC drama \"\" (2002). Scriptwriter Guy Jenkin explained that \"my Jeffrey Archer is the man who has frequently saved Britain over the last 30 years. He's beloved of all women he comes across, all men, all dogs — he's a superhero.\"\n\nIn the Amazon series \"Good Omen\" a reference is made by one of the angels in Aziraphale's bookshop, \"Something smells evil.\" Aziraphale replies, \"Oh, that would be the Jeffrey Archer books, I'm afraid.\"\n\nBULLET::::- \"Kane and Abel\" (1979)\nBULLET::::- \"The Prodigal Daughter\" (1982)\nBULLET::::- \"Shall We Tell the President?\" (1977/revised edition 1986)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Only Time Will Tell\" (2011)\nBULLET::::- \"The Sins of the Father\" (2012)\nBULLET::::- \"Best Kept Secret\" (2013)\nBULLET::::- \"Be Careful What You Wish For\" (2014)\nBULLET::::- \"Mightier Than the Sword\" (2015)\nBULLET::::- \"Cometh The Hour\" (2016)\nBULLET::::- \"This Was a Man\" (2016)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Nothing Ventured\" (2019)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less\" (1976)\nBULLET::::- \"First Among Equals\" (1984)\nBULLET::::- \"A Matter of Honour\" (1986)\nBULLET::::- \"As the Crow Flies\" (1991)\nBULLET::::- \"Honour Among Thieves\" (1993)\nBULLET::::- \"The Fourth Estate\" (1996)\nBULLET::::- \"The Eleventh Commandment\" (1998)\nBULLET::::- \"Sons of Fortune\" (2002)\nBULLET::::- \"False Impression\" (2005)\nBULLET::::- \"The Gospel According to Judas by Benjamin Iscariot\", with Francis J.

{"id": "16339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16339", "title": "Johannes Brahms", "text": "Johannes Brahms\n\nJohannes Brahms (; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, pianist, and conductor of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna. His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the \"Three Bs\" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow.\n\nBrahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, and voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. He worked with some of the leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire. An uncompromising perfectionist, Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished.\n\nBrahms has been considered, by his contemporaries and by later writers, as both a traditionalist and an innovator. His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. While many contemporaries found his music too academic, his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers. Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs.\n\nBrahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms (1806–72), was from the town of Heide in Holstein. The family name was also sometimes spelt 'Brahmst' or 'Brams', and derives from 'Bram', the German word for the shrub broom. Against the family's will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg in 1826, where he found work as a jobbing musician and a string and wind player. In 1830, he married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen (1789–1865), a seamstress 17 years older than he was. In the same year he was appointed as a horn player in the Hamburg militia. Eventually he became a double-bass player in the Stadttheater Hamburg and the Hamburg Philharmonic Society. As Johann Jakob prospered, the family moved over the years to ever better accommodation in Hamburg. Johannes Brahms was born in 1833; his sister Elisabeth (Elise) had been born in 1831 and a younger brother Fritz Friedrich (Fritz) was born in 1835. Fritz also became a pianist; overshadowed by his brother, he emigrated to Caracas in 1867, and later returned to Hamburg as a teacher.\n\nJohann Jakob gave his son his first musical training; Johannes also learnt to play the violin and the basics of playing the cello. From 1840 he studied piano with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel (1813–1865). Cossel complained in 1842 that Brahms \"could be such a good player, but he will not stop his never-ending composing.\" At the age of 10, Brahms made his debut as a performer in a private concert including Beethoven's quintet for piano and winds Op. 16 and a piano quartet by Mozart. He also played as a solo work an étude of Henri Herz. By 1845 he had written a piano sonata in G minor. His parents disapproved of his early efforts as a composer, feeling that he had better career prospects as a performer.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1848 Brahms studied with Cossel's teacher, the pianist and composer Eduard Marxsen (1806–1887). Marxsen had been a personal acquaintance of Beethoven and Schubert, admired the works of Mozart and Haydn, and was a devotee of the music of J. S. Bach. Marxsen conveyed to Brahms the tradition of these composers and ensured that Brahms's own compositions were grounded in that tradition. In 1847 Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a fantasy by Sigismund Thalberg. His first full piano recital, in 1848, included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain. A second recital in April 1849 included Beethoven's \"Waldstein\" sonata and a waltz fantasia of his own composition, and garnered favourable newspaper reviews.\n\nBrahms's compositions at this period are known to have included piano music, chamber music and works for male voice choir. Under the pseudonym 'G. W. Marks', some piano arrangements and fantasies were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849. The earliest of Brahms's works which he acknowledged (his \"Scherzo\" Op. 4 and the song \"Heimkehr\" Op. 7 no. 6) date from 1851. However Brahms was later assiduous in eliminating all his early works; even as late as 1880 he wrote to his friend Elise Giesemann to send him his manuscripts of choral music so that they could be destroyed.\n\nPersistent stories of the impoverished adolescent Brahms playing in bars and brothels have only anecdotal provenance, and many modern scholars dismiss them; the Brahms family was relatively prosperous, and Hamburg legislation very strictly forbade music in, or the admittance of minors to, brothels.\n\nIn 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the \"csardas\", which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of \"Hungarian Dances\" (1869 and 1880). 1850 also marked Brahms's first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann; during Schumann's visit to Hamburg that year, friends persuaded Brahms to send the former some of his compositions, but the package was returned unopened.\n\nIn 1853 Brahms went on a concert tour with Reményi. In late May the two visited the violinist and composer Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played some of his own solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: \"Never in the course of my artist's life have I been more completely overwhelmed\". This was the beginning of a friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) \"double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever\". Bozarth notes that \"products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included \"dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works.\"\n\nAfter meeting Joachim, Brahms and Reményi visited Weimar, where Brahms met Franz Liszt, Peter Cornelius, and Joachim Raff, and where Liszt performed Brahms's Op. 4 \"Scherzo\" at sight. Reményi claimed that Brahms then slept during Liszt's performance of his own Sonata in B minor; this and other disagreements led Reményi and Brahms to part company.\n\nBrahms visited Düsseldorf in October 1853, and, with a letter of introduction from Joachim, was welcomed by Schumann and his wife Clara. Schumann, greatly impressed and delighted by the 20-year-old's talent, published an article entitled \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the 28 October issue of the journal \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" nominating Brahms as one who was \"fated to give expression to the times in the highest and most ideal manner\". This praise may have aggravated Brahms's self-critical standards of perfection and dented his confidence. He wrote to Schumann in November 1853 that his praise \"will arouse such extraordinary expectations by the public that I don't know how I can begin to fulfil them\". While in Düsseldorf, Brahms participated with Schumann and Schumann's pupil Albert Dietrich in writing a movement each of a violin sonata for Joachim, the \"F-A-E Sonata\", the letters representing the initials of Joachim's personal motto \"Frei aber einsam\" (\"Free but lonely\").\n\nSchumann's accolade led to the first publication of Brahms's works under his own name. Brahms went to Leipzig where Breitkopf & Härtel published his Opp. 1–4 (the Piano Sonatas nos. 1 and 2, the Six Songs Op. 3, and the Scherzo Op. 4), whilst Bartholf Senff published the Third Piano Sonata Op. 5 and the Six Songs Op. 6. In Leipzig, he gave recitals including his own first two piano sonatas, and met with among others Ferdinand David, Ignaz Moscheles, and Hector Berlioz.\n\nAfter Schumann's attempted suicide and subsequent confinement in a mental sanatorium near Bonn in February 1854 (where he died of pneumonia in 1856), Brahms based himself in Düsseldorf, where he supported the household and dealt with business matters on Clara's behalf. Clara was not allowed to visit Robert until two days before his death, but Brahms was able to visit him and acted as a go-between. Brahms began to feel deeply for Clara, who to him represented an ideal of womanhood. Their intensely emotional platonic relationship lasted until Clara's death. In June 1854 Brahms dedicated to Clara his Op. 9, the \"Variations on a Theme of Schumann\". Clara continued to support Brahms's career by programming his music in her recitals.\n\nAfter the publication of his Op. 10 Ballades for piano, Brahms published no further works until 1860. His major project of this period was the Piano Concerto in D minor, which he had begun as a work for two pianos in 1854 but soon realized needed a larger-scale format. Based in Hamburg at this time, he gained, with Clara's support, a position as musician to the tiny court of Detmold, the capital of the Principality of Lippe, where he spent the winters of 1857 to 1860 and for which he wrote his two Serenades (1858 and 1859, Opp. 11 and 16). In Hamburg he established a women's choir for which he wrote music and conducted. To this period also belong his first two Piano Quartets (Op. 25 and Op. 26) and the first movement of the third Piano Quartet, which eventually appeared in 1875.\n\nThe end of the decade brought professional setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was \"a brilliant and decisive – failure...[I]t forces one to concentrate one's thoughts and increases one's courage...But the hissing was too much of a good thing...\" At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner. Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt's followers, the so-called \"New German School\" (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School's leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the \"rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias\". A draft was leaked to the press, and the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as backward-looking. Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.\n\nBrahms's personal life was also troubled. In 1859 he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold. The engagement was soon broken off, but even after this Brahms wrote to her: \"I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters. Please write me ... whether ... I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you.\" They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his \"last love\".\n\nBrahms had hoped to be given the conductorship of the Hamburg Philharmonic, but in 1862 this post was given to the baritone Julius Stockhausen. (Brahms continued to hope for the post; but when he was finally offered the directorship in 1893, he demurred as he had \"got used to the idea of having to go along other paths\".) In autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter. There he became an associate of two close members of Wagner's circle, his earlier friend Peter Cornelius and Karl Tausig, and of Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. and Julius Epstein, respectively the Director and head of violin studies, and the head of piano studies, at the Vienna Conservatoire. Brahms's circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the 'New German School') Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become amongst his greatest advocates.\nIn January 1863 Brahms met Richard Wagner for the first time, for whom he played his \"Handel Variations\" Op. 24, which he had completed the previous year. The meeting was cordial, although Wagner was in later years to make critical, and even insulting, comments on Brahms's music. Brahms however retained at this time and later a keen interest in Wagner's music, helping with preparations for Wagner's Vienna concerts in 1862/63, and being rewarded by Tausig with a manuscript of part of Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" (which Wagner demanded back in 1875). The \"Handel Variations\" also featured, together with the first Piano Quartet, in his first Viennese recitals, in which his performances were better-received by the public and critics than his music.\n\nAlthough Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home. In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie. He surprised his audiences by programming much work of the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J. S. Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli; more recent music was represented by works of Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn. Brahms also wrote works for the choir, including his Motet, Op. 29. Finding however that the post encroached too much of the time he needed for composing, he left the choir in June 1864. From 1864 to 1876 he spent many of his summers in Lichtental, today part of Baden-Baden, where Clara Schumann and her family also spent some time. His house in Lichtental, where he worked on many of his major compositions including \"A German Requiem\" and his middle-period chamber works, is preserved as a museum.\n\nIn February 1865 Brahms's mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work \"A German Requiem\" Op. 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866. Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahms's arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of \"Hungarian Dances\" (1869), the \"Liebeslieder Walzer\", Op. 52, (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata \"Rinaldo\" (1863–1868), his first two string quartets Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his first symphony which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.\n\nFrom 1872 to 1875, Brahms was director of the concerts of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. He ensured that the orchestra was staffed only by professionals, and conducted a repertoire which ran from Bach to the nineteenth century composers who were not of the 'New German School'; these included Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Joachim, Ferdinand Hiller, Max Bruch and himself (notably his large scale choral works, the \"German Requiem\", the \"Alto Rhapsody\", Op. 53, and the patriotic \"Triumphlied\", Op. 55, which celebrated Prussia's victory in the 1870/71 Franco-Prussian War). 1873 saw the premiere of his orchestral \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\", originally conceived for two pianos, which has become one of his most popular works.\n\nBrahms's first symphony, Op. 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s. During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868. Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult\", \"not exactly charming\" and, significantly \"long and in C Minor\", which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\"\n\nIn May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as \"theses\" and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees. Brahms was averse to traveling to England, and requested to receive the degree 'in absentia', offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony. But of the two, only Joachim went to England and only he was granted a degree. Brahms \"acknowledged the invitation\" by giving the manuscript score and parts of his first symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge March 8, 1877 (English premiere).\n\nDespite the warm reception the first symphony received, Brahms remained dissatisfied and extensively revised the second movement before the work was published. There followed a succession of well-received orchestral works; the Second Symphony Op. 73 (1877), the Violin Concerto Op. 77 (1878), dedicated to Joachim who was consulted closely during its composition, and the \"Academic Festival Overture\" (written following the conferring of an honorary degree by the University of Breslau) and \"Tragic Overture\" of 1880. The commendation of Brahms by Breslau as \"the leader in the art of serious music in Germany today\" led to a bilious comment from Wagner in his essay \"On Poetry and Composition\": \"I know of some famous composers who in their concert masquerades don the disguise of a street-singer one day, the hallelujah periwig of Handel the next, the dress of a Jewish Czardas-fiddler another time, and then again the guise of a highly respectable symphony dressed up as Number Ten\" (referring to Brahms's First Symphony as a putative tenth symphony of Beethoven).\n\nBrahms was now recognised as a major figure in the world of music. He had been on the jury which awarded the Vienna State Prize to the (then little-known) composer Antonín Dvořák three times, first in February 1875, and later in 1876 and 1877 and had successfully recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock. The two men met for the first time in 1877, and Dvořák dedicated to Brahms his String Quartet, Op. 44 of that year. He also began to be the recipient of a variety of honours; Ludwig II of Bavaria awarded him the Maximilian Order for Science and Art in 1874, and the music loving Duke George of Meiningen awarded him in 1881 the Commander's Cross of the Order of the House of Meiningen.\n\nAt this time Brahms also chose to change his image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he surprised his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz \"I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight.\" The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert \"I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice he introduced himself as 'Musikdirektor Müller'... an instant later, we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms's disguise\". The incident also displays Brahms's love of practical jokes.\n\nIn 1882 Brahms completed his Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83, dedicated to his teacher Marxsen. Brahms was invited by Hans von Bülow to undertake a premiere of the work with the Meiningen Court Orchestra; this was the beginning of his collaboration with Meiningen and with von Bülow, who was to rank Brahms as one of the 'Three Bs'; in a letter to his wife he wrote \"You know what I think of Brahms: after Bach and Beethoven the greatest, the most sublime of all composers.\" The following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony Op. 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony Op. 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: \"a giant work, great in concept and invention.\" Another, but cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance; he rated Brahms as superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven.\n\nIn 1889, Theo Wangemann, a representative of the American inventor Thomas Edison, visited the composer in Vienna and invited him to make an experimental recording. Brahms played an abbreviated version of his first Hungarian Dance and of Josef Strauss's \"Die Libelle\" on the piano. Although the spoken introduction to the short piece of music is quite clear, the piano playing is largely inaudible due to heavy surface noise.\n\nIn that same year, Brahms was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg.\n\nBrahms had become acquainted with Johann Strauss II, who was eight years his senior, in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after. Brahms admired much of Strauss's music, and encouraged the composer to sign up with his publisher Simrock. In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of \"The Blue Danube\" waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\".\n\nAfter the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, op. 111, in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he \"had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.\" He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28). His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op. 114, Clarinet Quintet, Op. 115 (1891), and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120 (1894). Brahms also wrote at this time his final cycles of piano pieces, Opp. 116–19, the \"Vier ernste Gesänge\" (Four Serious Songs), Op. 121 (1896) (which were prompted by the death of Clara Schumann), and the Eleven Chorale Preludes for organ, Op. 122 (1896). The last of these is a setting of \"O Welt ich muss dich lassen\", (\"O world I must leave thee\"), and are the last notes that Brahms wrote. Many of these works were written in his house in Bad Ischl, where Brahms had first visited in 1882 and where he spent every summer from 1889 onwards.\nIn the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed as having jaundice, and later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him as having cancer of the liver (from which his father Jakob had died). His last public appearance was on 3 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No. 4. There was an ovation after each of the four movements. He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta \"Die Göttin der Vernunft\" (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897. His condition gradually worsened and he died on 3 April 1897, in Vienna, aged 63. Brahms is buried in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna, under a monument designed by Victor Horta with sculpture by Ilse von Twardowski.\n\nBrahms maintained a classical sense of form and order in his works, in contrast to the opulence of the music of many of his contemporaries. Thus, many admirers (though not necessarily Brahms himself) saw him as the champion of traditional forms and \"pure music\", as opposed to the \"New German\" embrace of programme music.\n\nBrahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style. Brahms's First Symphony bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as the two works are both in C minor and end in the struggle towards a C major triumph. The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce could see that. In 1876, when the work was premiered in Vienna, it was immediately hailed as \"Beethoven's Tenth\". Indeed, the similarity of Brahms's music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann.\n\nBrahms was a master of counterpoint. \"For Brahms, ... the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions,\" writes Geiringer. \"As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.\" Writers on Brahms have commented on his use of counterpoint. For example, of Op. 9, \"Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann,\" Geiringer writes that Brahms \"displays all the resources of contrapuntal art\". In the A Major piano quartet Opus 26, Swafford notes that the third movement is \"demonic-canonic\", echoing Haydn's famous minuet for string quartet called the 'Witch's Round'.\" Swafford further opines that \"thematic development, counterpoint, and form were the dominant technical terms in which Brahms... thought about music\".\n\nAllied to his skill in counterpoint was his subtle handling of rhythm and meter. The \"New Grove Dictionary of Music\" speculates that the his contact with Hungarian and gypsy folk music as a teenager led to \"his lifelong fascination with the irregular rhythms, triplet figures and use of rubato\" in his compositions. The Hungarian Dances are among Brahms's most-appreciated pieces. According to Michael Musgrave (1985, p. 269) \"only one composer rivals him in the advanced nature of his rhythmic thinking, and that is Stravinsky.\"\n\nHis consummate skills in counterpoint and rhythm are richly present in \"A German Requiem\", a work that was partially inspired by his mother's death in 1865 (at which time he composed a funeral march that was to become the basis of Part Two, \"Denn alles Fleisch\"), but which also incorporates material from a symphony which he started in 1854 but abandoned following Schumann's suicide attempt. He once wrote that the Requiem \"belonged to Schumann\". The first movement of this abandoned symphony was re-worked as the first movement of the First Piano Concerto.\n\nBrahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn. He collected first editions and autographs of their works and edited performing editions. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and, especially, Johann Sebastian Bach. His friends included leading musicologists, and, with Friedrich Chrysander, he edited an edition of the works of François Couperin. Brahms also edited works by C. P. E. Bach and W. F. Bach. He looked to older music for inspiration in the art of counterpoint; the themes of some of his works are modelled on Baroque sources such as Bach's \"The Art of Fugue\" in the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 or the same composer's Cantata No. 150 in the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony's finale. Peter Phillips (2007) hears affinities between Brahms's rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd. Referring to Byrd's \"Though Amaryllis dance\", Philips remarks that “the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms's compositional style.”\n\nThe early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Franz Schubert. The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op. 25 and Op. 26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands. The influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs (for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op. 4, alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor; the scherzo movement in Brahms's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor).\n\nBrahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers' innovations in extended tonality resulted in the rule of tonality being broken altogether. Although Wagner became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early \"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel\"; Brahms himself, according to many sources, deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory.\n\nBrahms wrote settings for piano and voice of 144 German folk songs, and many of his lieder reflect folk themes or depict scenes of rural life.\n\nBrahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including two Serenades, four symphonies, two piano concertos (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and two companion orchestral overtures, the \"Academic Festival Overture\" and the \"Tragic Overture\".\n\nHis large choral work \"A German Requiem\" is not a setting of the liturgical \"Missa pro defunctis\" but a setting of texts which Brahms selected from the Luther Bible. The work was composed in three major periods of his life. An early version of the second movement was first composed in 1854, not long after Robert Schumann's attempted suicide, and this was later used in his first piano concerto. The majority of the Requiem was composed after his mother's death in 1865. The fifth movement was added after the official premiere in 1868, and the work was published in 1869.\n\nHis works in variation form include, among others, the \"Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel\" and the \"Paganini Variations\", both for solo piano, and the \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\" (now sometimes called the \"Saint Anthony Variations\") in versions for two pianos and for orchestra. The final movement of the Fourth Symphony, Op. 98, is formally a passacaglia.\n\nHis chamber works include three string quartets, two string quintets, two string sextets, a clarinet quintet, a clarinet trio, a horn trio, a piano quintet, three piano quartets, and four piano trios (the fourth being published posthumously). He composed several instrumental sonatas with piano, including three for violin, two for cello, and two for clarinet (which were subsequently arranged for viola by the composer). His solo piano works range from his early piano sonatas and ballades to his late sets of character pieces. Brahms was a significant Lieder composer, who wrote over 200 of them. His chorale preludes for organ, Op. 122, which he wrote shortly before his death, have become an important part of the organ repertoire. They were published posthumously in 1902. The last of this set is a setting of the chorale, \"O Welt ich muss dich lassen\", \"O world I now must leave thee\" and were the last notes he wrote.\n\nBrahms was an extreme perfectionist. He destroyed many early works – including a violin sonata he had performed with Reményi and violinist Ferdinand David – and once claimed to have destroyed 20 string quartets before he issued his official First in 1873. Over the course of several years, he changed an original project for a symphony in D minor into his first piano concerto. In another instance of devotion to detail, he laboured over the official First Symphony for almost fifteen years, from about 1861 to 1876. Even after its first few performances, Brahms destroyed the original slow movement and substituted another before the score was published. (A conjectural restoration of the original slow movement has been published by Robert Pascall.)\n\nAnother factor that contributed to his perfectionism was Schumann's early enthusiasm, which Brahms was determined to live up to. Schumann's early approbation was a challenge to the composer's self-confidence, and may have contributed to the delay in producing the First Symphony.\n\nBrahms strongly preferred writing absolute music that does not refer to an explicit scene or narrative, and he never wrote an opera or a symphonic poem.\n\nDespite his mastery of large, complex musical structures, some of his most popular compositions during his lifetime were small-scale works that were readily accessible to the contemporary market for domestic music-making. Among these lighter works are his sets of popular dances, the \"Hungarian Dances\", the Waltzes for piano duet (Op. 39), and the \"Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52.\n\nBrahms looked both backward and forward; his output was often bold in its exploration of harmony and rhythm. As a result, he was an influence on composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies. Within his lifetime, his idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen, as well as on Gustav Jenner, who was his only formal composition pupil. Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the Symphony No. 7 in D minor and the F minor Piano Trio. Features of the \"Brahms style\" were absorbed in a more complex synthesis with other contemporary (chiefly Wagnerian) trends by Hans Rott, Wilhelm Berger, Max Reger and Franz Schmidt, whereas the British composers Hubert Parry and Edward Elgar and the Swede Wilhelm Stenhammar all testified to learning much from Brahms. As Elgar said, \"I look at the Third Symphony of Brahms, and I feel like a pygmy.\"\n\nFerruccio Busoni's early music shows much Brahmsian influence, and Brahms took an interest in him, though Busoni later tended to disparage Brahms. Towards the end of his life, Brahms offered substantial encouragement to Ernő Dohnányi and to Alexander von Zemlinsky. Their early chamber works (and those of Béla Bartók, who was friendly with Dohnányi) show a thoroughgoing absorption of the Brahmsian idiom. Zemlinsky, moreover, was in turn the teacher of Arnold Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed by drafts of two movements of Schoenberg's early Quartet in D major which Zemlinsky showed him in 1897. In 1933, Schoenberg wrote an essay \"Brahms the Progressive\" (re-written 1947), which drew attention to his fondness for motivic saturation and irregularities of rhythm and phrase; in his last book (\"Structural Functions of Harmony\", 1948), he analysed Brahms's \"enriched harmony\" and exploration of remote tonal regions. These efforts paved the way for a re-evaluation of his reputation in the 20th century. Schoenberg went so far as to orchestrate one of Brahms's piano quartets. Schoenberg's pupil Anton Webern, in his 1933 lectures, posthumously published under the title \"The Path to the New Music\", claimed Brahms as one who had anticipated the developments of the Second Viennese School, and Webern's own Op. 1, an orchestral passacaglia, is clearly in part a homage to, and development of, the variation techniques of the passacaglia-finale of Brahms's Fourth Symphony. Ann Scott has shown how Brahms anticipated the procedures of the serialists by redistributing melodic fragments between instruments, as in the first movement of the Clarinet Sonata, Op.120 No. 2.\n\nBrahms was honoured in the German hall of fame, the Walhalla memorial. On 14 September 2000, he was introduced there as the 126th \"rühmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher\" and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor .\n\nBrahms was baptised into the Lutheran church as an infant, and was confirmed at aged fifteen (at St. Michael's Church, Hamburg), but has been described as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: \"Such a man, such a fine soul – and he believes in nothing! He believes in nothing!\" When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional explicitly religious text to his \"German Requiem\", Brahms is reported to have responded, \"As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like . On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, because I needed it, and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything. But I had better stop before I say too much.\"\n\nBULLET::::- Avins, Styra (ed.), (1997). \"Johannes Brahms: Life and Letters\" (1997). Translated by Joseph Eisinger and S. Avins.

{"id": "16340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16340", "title": "Jean-Paul Sartre", "text": "Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nJean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (, ; ; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. His work has also influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to influence these disciplines.\n\nSartre was also noted for his open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer Simone de Beauvoir. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered bourgeois, in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive conformity (\"mauvaise foi\", literally, \"bad faith\") and an \"authentic\" way of \"being\" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work \"Being and Nothingness\" (\"L'Être et le Néant\", 1943). Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work \"Existentialism Is a Humanism\" (\"L'existentialisme est un humanisme\", 1946), originally presented as a lecture.\n\nHe was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that \"a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution\".\n\nJean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in Paris as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the French Navy, and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer). His mother was of Alsatian origin and the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer, whose father Louis Théophile was the younger brother of Anne-Marie's father.\nWhen Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in Indochina. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in Meudon, where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to classical literature at a very early age. When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to La Rochelle, where he was frequently bullied.\n\nAs a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading Henri Bergson's essay \"\". He attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school in Paris. He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his \"\" (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) in Paris at the École Normale Supérieure, an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals. (His 1928 MA thesis under the title \"L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature\" [\"Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature\"] was supervised by Henri Delacroix.) It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with Raymond Aron. Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at Alexandre Kojève's seminars, which continued for a number of years.\n\nFrom his first years in the École Normale, Sartre was one of its fiercest pranksters. In 1927, his antimilitarist satirical cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with Georges Canguilhem, particularly upset the director Gustave Lanson. In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland, he organized a media prank following Charles Lindbergh's successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre & Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including \"Le Petit Parisien\", announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh look-alike. The public's resultant outcry forced Lanson to resign.\n\nIn 1929 at the École Normale, he met Simone de Beauvoir, who studied at the Sorbonne and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship, though they were not monogamous. The first time Sartre took the agrégation, he failed. He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.\n\nSartre was drafted into the French Army from 1939 to 1941 and served as a meteorologist for some time. He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the Algerian War of Independence.\n\nFrom 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various lycées of Le Havre (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day , 1931–36), Laon (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the Lycée Pasteur, 1937–39, and at the Lycée Condorcet, 1941–44; see below).\n\nIn 1932, Sartre discovered \"Voyage au bout de la nuit\" by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a book that had a remarkable influence on him.\n\nIn 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the Institut français d'Allemagne in Berlin where he studied Edmund Husserl's phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read Emmanuel Levinas's \"Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl\" (\"The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology\").\n\nThe Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\nIn 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army, where he served as a meteorologist. He was captured by German troops in 1940 in Padoux, and he spent nine months as a prisoner of war—in Nancy and finally in , Trier, where he wrote his first theatrical piece, \"Barionà, fils du tonnerre\", a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read Martin Heidegger's \"Sein und Zeit\", later to become a major influence on his own essay on phenomenological ontology. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and exotropia affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist. Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris and settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position, previously held by a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by Vichy law, at Lycée Condorcet in Paris.\nAfter coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group \"Socialisme et Liberté\" (\"Socialism and Liberty\") with other writers Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint Desanti, Dominique Desanti, Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with \"cheerful ferocity\" at a meeting that the \"Socialisme et Liberté\" assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel Déat, but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as \"none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades\". The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General Otto von Stülpnagel, and the popular slogan always was \"Death to Laval!\" rather than \"Death to Hitler!\". In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of André Gide and André Malraux. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. \"Socialisme et liberté\" soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote \"Being and Nothingness\", \"The Flies\", and \"No Exit\", none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.\n\nIn his essay \"Paris under the Occupation\", Sartre wrote that the \"correct\" behaviour of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural:\n\nThe Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.\n\nSartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark \"We could not be \"natural\"\". French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation. Ousby wrote: \"But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life\". Sartre wrote the very \"correctness\" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the \"correct\" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the \"New Order in Europe\", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.\n\nThroughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany. Sartre wrote about the \"languid existence\" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing: \"Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life\". Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou. The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat. Sartre also remarked that conversations at the Café de Flore between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a \"mouche\" (informer) or a writer of the \"corbeau\" (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship. Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the \"Abwehr\" alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as \"mouches\" while by 1942 the Paris \"Kommandantur\" was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the \"corbeaux\".\n\nSartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a \"sham\", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone. Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris \"was peopled by the absent\". Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation, writing:\n\nOne day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the \"concierge\" forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words\" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].\n\nSartre wrote the \"feldgrau\" (\"field grey\") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called \"a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians\". Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans \"les autres\" (\"the others\"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play \"Huis clos\" (\"No Exit\") of \"\"l'enfer, c'est les Autres\"\" (\"Hell is other people\"). Sartre intended the line \"\"l'enfer, c'est les Autres\"\" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.\n\nAfter August 1944 and the Liberation of Paris, he wrote \"Anti-Semite and Jew\". In the book he tries to explain the etiology of \"hate\" by analyzing antisemitic hate. Sartre was a very active contributor to \"Combat\", a newspaper created during the clandestine period by Albert Camus, a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's \"The Rebel\". Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant Vladimir Jankelevitch criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.\n\nIn 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the rue Bonaparte which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political review, \"Les Temps modernes\" (\"Modern Times\"), in part to popularize his thought. He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, \"Les Chemins de la Liberté\" (\"The Roads to Freedom\") (1945–1949).\n\nThe first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the Resistance after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the \"résistants\" were a \"band of brothers\" who had enjoyed \"real freedom\" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war. Sartre was \"merciless\" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach from being executed. His 1948 play \"Les mains sales\" (\"Dirty Hands\") in particular explored the problem of being a politically \"engaged\" intellectual. He embraced Marxism but did not join the Communist Party. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as \"provincial\" and in a 1949 essay called for a \"United States of Europe\". In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal \"Politique étrangère\", Sartre wrote:\n\nIf we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.\n\nAbout the Korean War, Sartre wrote: \"I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans\". In July 1950, Sartre wrote in \"Les Temps Modernes\" about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:\n\nAs we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.\n\nSartre held that the Soviet Union was a \"revolutionary\" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of \"bourgeois\" states were due to their innate shortcomings. The Swiss journalist François Bondy wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews \"a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary\" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges \"may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power\", deeming Sartre's position to be \"existentialist\".\n\nWhile a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a \"complete freedom of criticism\" while condemning the United States for sinking into \"prefascism\". Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union \"still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books\". He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: \"In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all\". Sartre came to admire the Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, a man who favored a \"Polish road to socialism\" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue. Sartre's newspaper \"Les Temps Modernes\" devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms. Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's \"ultra Bolshevism\" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader Mao Zedong as the man who led the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.\n\nAs an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the FLN in the Algerian War and was one of the signatories of the \"Manifeste des 121\". Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary Organisation armée secrète (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s. (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and, along with Bertrand Russell and others, organized a tribunal intended to expose U.S. war crimes, which became known as the Russell Tribunal in 1967.\nHis work after Stalin's death, the \"Critique de la raison dialectique\" (\"Critique of Dialectical Reason\"), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the \"Critique\" Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of \"class\" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, Louis Althusser, who claimed that the ideas of the young Marx were decisively superseded by the \"scientific\" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by Frantz Fanon stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the \"real damned of the earth\", who would carry out the revolution. A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the \"Americanization\" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.\n\nSartre went to Cuba in the 1960s to meet Fidel Castro and spoke with Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\" and the \"era's most perfect man\". Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that \"he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel\". However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: \"In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals\".\n\nDuring a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited Red Army Faction member Andreas Baader in Stammheim Prison and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Sartre began to describe himself as a \"special kind\" of anarchist.\n\nIn 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, \"Les Mots\" (\"The Words\"). The book is an ironic counterblast to Marcel Proust, whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of André Gide (who had provided the model of \"littérature engagée\" for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize, and remains one of only two laureates to do so. According to Lars Gyllensten, in the book \"Minnen, bara minnen\" (\"Memories, Only Memories\") published in 2000, Sartre himself or someone close to him got in touch with the Swedish Academy in 1975 with a request for the prize money, but was refused. In 1945, he had refused the Légion d'honneur. The Nobel prize was announced on 22 October 1964; on 14 October, Sartre had written a letter to the Nobel Institute, asking to be removed from the list of nominees, and warning that he would not accept the prize if awarded, but the letter went unread; on 23 October, \"Le Figaro\" published a statement by Sartre explaining his refusal. He said he did not wish to be \"transformed\" by such an award, and did not want to take sides in an East vs. West cultural struggle by accepting an award from a prominent Western cultural institution. Nevertheless, he was that year's prizewinner. After being awarded the prize he tried to escape the media by hiding in the house of Simone's sister Hélène de Beauvoir in Goxwiller, Alsace.\nThough his name was then a household word (as was \"existentialism\" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the May 1968 strikes in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. President Charles de Gaulle intervened and pardoned him, commenting that \"you don't arrest Voltaire\".\n\nIn 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:\n\nI would like <nowiki>[people]</nowiki> to remember \"Nausea\", <nowiki>[my plays]</nowiki> \"No Exit\" and \"The Devil and the Good Lord\", and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\". Then my essay on Genet, \"Saint Genet\". ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.\n\nSartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of amphetamine) he put himself through during the writing of the \"Critique\" and a massive analytical biography of Gustave Flaubert (\"The Family Idiot\"), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension, and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious chain smoker, which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.\n\nSartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from edema of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at Père-Lachaise Cemetery between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto boulevard du Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege. The funeral started at \"the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet\". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate. Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.\n\nSartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are \"condemned to be free\". This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the paper cutter. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: \"existence precedes essence\". This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. \"We are left alone, without excuse.\" \"We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us.\"\n\nSartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience \"death consciousness\" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge. Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world. In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.\n\nAs a junior lecturer at the Lycée du Havre in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel \"La Nausée\" (\"Nausea\"), which serves in some ways as a manifesto of existentialism and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the German phenomenological movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.\n\nHe also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: \"Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.\"\n\nThis indifference of \"things in themselves\" (closely linked with the later notion of \"being-in-itself\" in his \"Being and Nothingness\") has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the \"nausea\" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.\n\nThe novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of Immanuel Kant's fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that morality is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying \"Condemned to be free\") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.\n\nAlso important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions. \"When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself.\"\n\nWhile the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45. Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: \"Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined <nowiki>[with]</nowiki> women. He wrote. And he was published.\" Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where \"the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out\".\n\nSartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in \"The Age of Reason\", which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute rationalist, analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could \"recognize no allegiance except to [him]self\", though he realized that without \"responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing\". Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the Spanish Civil War, and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.\n\nThe war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: \"the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time.\" Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the \"Socialisme et Liberté\" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group, in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this \"crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature\".\n\nThe symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, \"Les Temps modernes\", in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment. Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.\n\nSartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a public intellectual. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true existential fashion, \"culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention.\" This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a pragmatist, willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in human freedom, preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work \"subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines\". Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: \"the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.\"\n\nSartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the French Communist Party (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the Liberation the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism. From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its \"authoritarian tendencies\". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the Maoists, a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties. However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: \"If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.\" He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.\n\nIn the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which \"reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there\". The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the \"traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior\", but there is \"a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced\" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of bourgeois political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.\n\nThe struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.\n\nThe role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian self-determination at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from Oran, Algeria.\n\nSartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, \"Huis-clos\" (\"No Exit\"), contains the famous line \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\", usually translated as \"Hell is other people.\" Aside from the impact of \"Nausea\", Sartre's major work of fiction was \"The Roads to Freedom\" trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, \"Roads to Freedom\" presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to existentialism.\n\nJohn Huston got Sartre to script his film \"\". However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits. Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.\n\nDespite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Church placed Sartre's oeuvre on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (List of Prohibited Books).\n\nSome philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. Herbert Marcuse criticized \"Being and Nothingness\" for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory.\" In \"Letter on Humanism\", Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:\n\nExistentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking \"existentia\" and \"essentia\" according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that \"essentia\" precedes \"existentia\". Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.\n\nThe philosophers Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud. Richard Webster considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.\n\nIntellectuals associated with the political right allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of authoritarianism. Brian C. Anderson denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of Stalinism, Maoism, and Castro's regime in Cuba. The historian Paul Johnson asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the Khmer Rouge leadership: \"The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them.\"\n\nSartre, who stated in his preface to Frantz Fanon's \"The Wretched of the Earth\" that, \"To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man\", has been criticized by Anderson and Michael Walzer for supporting the killing of European civilians by the FLN during the Algerian War. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.\n\nThe critic, poet, essayist and philosopher Clive James excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies \"Cultural Amnesia\" (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being \"all a pose\".\n\nBULLET::::- Plays, screenplays, novels, and short stories\n\nBULLET::::- \"Nausea\" / \"La nausée\" (1938)\nBULLET::::- \"The Wall\" / \"Le mur\" (1939)\nBULLET::::- \"Bariona\" / \"Bariona, ou le fils du tonnerre\" (1940)\nBULLET::::- \"The Flies\" / \"Les mouches\" (1943)\nBULLET::::- \"No Exit\" / \"Huis clos\" (1944)\nBULLET::::- \"Typhus\", wr.

{"id": "16341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16341", "title": "John Paul Jones", "text": "John Paul Jones\n\nRear Admiral John Paul Jones (born John Paul; July 6, 1747 July 18, 1792) was the United States' first well-known naval commander in the American Revolutionary War. He made many friends and enemies—who accused him of piracy—among America's political elites, and his actions in British waters during the Revolution earned him an international reputation which persists to this day. As such, he is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of the American Navy\" (a sobriquet he shares with John Barry and John Adams).\n\nJones grew up in Scotland, became a sailor, and served as commander of several British merchant ships. After having killed one of his crew members with a sword, he fled to the Colony of Virginia and around 1775 joined the newly founded Continental Navy in their fight against Britain in the American Revolutionary War. He commanded U.S. Navy ships stationed in France and led one single assault on England, which resulted in a failure, and few on British merchant ships. Left without a command in 1787, he joined the Imperial Russian Navy and obtained the rank of rear admiral.\n\nJohn Paul (he added \"Jones\" in later life to hide from law enforcement) was born on the estate of Arbigland near Kirkbean in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright on the southwest coast of Scotland. His father John Paul Sr. was a gardener at Arbigland, and his mother was Jean McDuff (1708–1767). His parents married on November 29, 1733 in New Abbey, Kirkcudbright.\n\nJohn Paul started his maritime career at the age of 13, sailing out of Whitehaven in the northern English county of Cumberland as apprentice aboard \"Friendship\" under Captain Benson. Paul's older brother William Paul had married and settled in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Virginia was the destination of many of the younger Jones's voyages.\n\nFor several years, Paul sailed aboard a number of merchant and slave ships, including \"King George\" in 1764 as third mate and \"Two Friends\" as first mate in 1766. In 1768, he abandoned his prestigious position on the profitable \"Two Friends\" while docked in Jamaica. He found his own passage back to Scotland, and eventually obtained another position.\n\nJohn Paul's career was quickly and unexpectedly advanced during his next voyage aboard the brig \"John\", which sailed from port in 1768, when both the captain and a ranking mate suddenly died of yellow fever. Paul managed to navigate the ship back to a safe port and, in reward for this feat, the vessel's grateful Scottish owners made him master of the ship and its crew, giving him 10 percent of the cargo. He led two voyages to the West Indies before running into difficulty.\n\nDuring his second voyage in 1770, John Paul had one of his crew flogged after trying to start a mutiny about early payment of wages, leading to accusations that his discipline was \"unnecessarily cruel\". These claims initially were dismissed, but his favorable reputation was destroyed when the sailor died a few weeks later. John Paul was arrested for his involvement in the man's death, and was imprisoned in Kirkcudbright Tolbooth, but later released on bail. The negative effect of this episode on his reputation is indisputable, although the man's death has been linked to yellow fever. The local governor encouraged John Paul to leave the area and change his name while on bail. The man who died of his injuries was not a usual sailor but an adventurer from a very influential Scottish family.\n\nLeaving Scotland, John Paul commanded a London-registered vessel named \"Betsy\", a West Indiaman mounting 22 guns, engaging in commercial speculation in Tobago for about 18 months. This came to an end, however, when he killed a mutinous crew member named Blackton with a sword in a dispute over wages. Years later, in a letter to Benjamin Franklin describing the incident, John Paul claimed that the killing was committed in self-defense, but he was not willing to be tried in an Admiral's Court, where the family of his first victim had been influential. \n\nHe felt compelled to flee to Fredericksburg, Virginia, leaving his fortune behind; he also sought to arrange the affairs of his brother, who had died there without leaving any immediate family. About this time, John Paul assumed the surname of Jones (in addition to his original surname). There is a long-held tradition in the state of North Carolina that John Paul adopted the name \"Jones\" in honor of Willie Jones of Halifax, North Carolina. Another source Lillie Thomas High states her grandfather said she was born in the room that John Paul stayed in while he had typhoid fever. The home \"Mount Gallant\" had belonged to Brigadier General Allen Jones and the family had cared for John Paul Jones. Willie Jones found John Paul and took him to his brother Allen's house. John Paul would have been killed if the British found him.\n\nFrom that period, America became \"the country of his fond election\", as he afterwards expressed himself to Baron Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol. It was not long afterward that John Paul \"Jones\" joined the American navy to fight against Britain.\n\nSources struggle with this period of Jones's life, especially the specifics of his family situation, making it difficult to pinpoint historically Jones's exact motivations for emigrating to America. It is not known whether his plans were not developing as expected for the plantation, or if he was inspired by a revolutionary spirit.\n\nJones left for Philadelphia shortly after settling in North America to volunteer his services around 1775 to the newly founded Continental Navy, precursor to the United States Navy. During this time, the Navy and Marines were being formally established, and suitable ship's officers and captains were in great demand. Jones's potential would likely have gone unrecognized were it not for the endorsement of Richard Henry Lee, who knew of his abilities. With help from influential members of the Continental Congress, Jones was appointed as a 1st Lieutenant of the newly converted 24-gun frigate \"Alfred\" in the Continental Navy on December 7, 1775. \n\nJones sailed from the Delaware River in February 1776 aboard \"Alfred\" on the Continental Navy's maiden cruise. It was aboard this vessel that Jones took the honor of hoisting the first U.S. ensign−the Grand Union Flag−over a naval vessel.\n\nThe fleet had been expected to cruise along the coast but was ordered instead by Commodore Esek Hopkins to sail for The Bahamas, where Nassau was raided for military supplies. The fleet had an unsuccessful encounter with a British packet ship on their return voyage. Jones was then assigned command of the sloop . Congress had recently ordered the construction of thirteen frigates for the American Navy, one of which was to be commanded by Jones. In exchange for this prestigious command, Jones accepted his commission aboard the smaller \"Providence\". Over the summer of 1776 as commander of \"Providence\", Jones performed various services for the Continental Navy and Congress. These services included the transport of troops, the movement of supplies and the escort of convoys. During this time, Jones was able to assist a 'brig from Hispaniola' that was being chased by HMS \"Cerberus\" and laden with military stores. This ship was then purchased by Congress and put in commission as Captain Hoysted Hacker commanding. During a later six-week voyage to Nova Scotia, Jones captured sixteen prizes and inflicted significant damage in the Raid on Canso.\n\nJones's next command came as a result of Commodore Hopkins's orders to liberate hundreds of American prisoners forced to labor in coal mines in Nova Scotia, and also to raid British shipping. On November 1, 1776, Jones set sail in command of \"Alfred\" to carry out this mission. Winter conditions prevented freeing the prisoners, but the mission did result in the capture of \"Mellish\", a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for General John Burgoyne's troops in Canada.\n\nDespite his successes at sea, Jones's disagreements with those in authority reached a new level upon arrival in Boston on December 16, 1776. While at the port, he began feuding with Commodore Hopkins, as Jones believed that Hopkins was hindering his advancement by talking down his campaign plans. As a result of this and other frustrations, Jones was assigned the smaller command of the newly constructed on June 14, 1777, the same day that the new Stars and Stripes flag was adopted.\n\nAfter making the necessary preparations, Jones sailed for France on November 1, 1777, with orders to assist the American cause however possible. The American commissioners in France were Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee, and they listened to Jones's strategic recommendations. They promised him the command of , a new vessel being constructed for America in Amsterdam. Britain, however, was able to divert \"L'Indien\" away from American hands by exerting pressure to ensure its sale to France instead (which had not yet allied with America). \nJones was again left without a command, an unpleasant reminder of his stagnation in Boston from late 1776 until early 1777. It is thought that during this time Jones developed his close friendship with Benjamin Franklin, whom he greatly admired.\n\nOn February 6, 1778, France signed the Treaty of Alliance with America, formally recognizing the independence of the new American republic. Eight days later, Captain Jones's \"Ranger\" became the first American naval vessel to be formally saluted by the French, with a nine-gun salute fired from captain Lamotte-Piquet's flagship. Jones wrote of the event: \"I accepted his offer all the more for after all it was a recognition of our independence and in the nation\".\n\nOn April 10, 1778, Jones set sail from Brest, France, for the western coasts of Britain.\n\nJones had some early successes against British merchant shipping in the Irish Sea. He persuaded his crew on April 17, 1778, to participate in an assault on Whitehaven, the town where his maritime career had begun. Jones later wrote about the poor command qualities of his senior officers (having tactfully avoided such matters in his official report): \"'Their object', they said, 'was gain not honor'. They were poor: instead of encouraging the morale of the crew, they excited them to disobedience; they persuaded them that they had the right to judge whether a measure that was proposed to them was good or bad\".\nAs it happened, contrary winds forced them to abandon the attempt and drove \"Ranger\" towards Ireland, causing more trouble for British shipping on the way.\n\nOn April 20, 1778, Jones learned from captured sailors that the Royal Navy sloop of war was anchored off Carrickfergus, Ireland. According to the diary of \"Ranger\"s surgeon, Jones's first intention was to attack the vessel in broad daylight, but his sailors were \"unwilling to undertake it\" (another incident omitted from the official report). Therefore, the attack took place just after midnight, but the mate responsible for dropping the anchor to halt \"Ranger\" right alongside \"Drake\" misjudged the timing in the dark (Jones claimed in his memoirs that the man was drunk), so Jones had to cut his anchor cable and run. The wind shifted, and \"Ranger\" recrossed the Irish Sea to make another attempt at raiding Whitehaven. Jones led the assault with two boats of fifteen men just after midnight on April 23, 1778, hoping to set fire to and sink all Whitehaven's ships anchored in harbor, which numbered between 200 and 400 wooden vessels and consisted of a full merchant fleet and many coal transporters. They also hoped to terrorize the townspeople by lighting further fires. As it happened, the journey to shore was slowed by the still-shifting wind, as well as a strong ebb tide. They successfully spiked the town's big defensive guns to prevent them being fired, but lighting fires proved difficult, as the lanterns in both boats had run out of fuel. To remedy this, some of the party were sent to raid a public house on the quayside, but the temptation to stop for a quick drink led to a further delay. Dawn was breaking by the time they returned and began the arson attacks, so efforts were concentrated on the coal ship \"Thompson\" in the hope that the flames would spread to adjacent vessels, all grounded by the low tide. However, in the twilight, one of the crew slipped away and alerted residents on a harbourside street. A fire alert was sounded, and large numbers of people came running to the quay, forcing the Americans to retreat, and extinguishing the flames with the town's two fire-engines. The townspeople's hopes of sinking Jones's boats with cannon fire were dashed because of the prudent spiking.\n\nJones next crossed the Solway Firth from Whitehaven to Scotland, hoping to hold for ransom the Earl of Selkirk, who lived on St Mary's Isle near Kirkcudbright. The Earl, Jones reasoned, could be exchanged for American sailors impressed into the Royal Navy. The Earl was discovered to be absent from his estate, so his wife entertained the officers and conducted negotiations. Canadian historian Peter C. Newman gives credit to the governess for protecting the young heir and to the butler for filling a sack half with coal, and topping it up with the family silver, in order to fob off the Americans. Jones claimed that he intended to return directly to his ship and continue seeking prizes elsewhere, but his crew wished to \"pillage, burn, and plunder all they could\". Ultimately, Jones allowed the crew to seize a silver plate set adorned with the family's emblem to placate their desires, but nothing else. Jones bought the plate himself when it was later sold off in France, and returned it to the Earl of Selkirk after the war.\n\nThe attacks on St. Mary's Isle and Whitehaven resulted in no prizes or profits which would be shared with the crew under normal circumstances, although their effect was significant on British morale and allocation of defense resources. Throughout the mission, the crew acted as if they were aboard a privateer, not a warship, led by Lieutenant Thomas Simpson, Jones's second-in-command.\n\nJones led \"Ranger\" back across the Irish Sea, hoping to make another attempt at the \"Drake\", still anchored off Carrickfergus. This time, late in the afternoon of April 24, 1778, the ships, roughly equal in firepower, engaged in combat. Earlier in the day, the Americans had captured the crew of a reconnaissance boat, and learned that \"Drake\" had taken on dozens of soldiers, with the intention of grappling and boarding \"Ranger\", so Jones made sure that did not happen, capturing \"Drake\" after an hour-long gun battle which cost the British captain his life. Lieutenant Simpson was given command of \"Drake\" for the return journey to Brest. The ships separated during the return journey as \"Ranger\" chased another prize, leading to a conflict between Simpson and Jones. Both ships arrived at port safely, but Jones filed for a court-martial of Simpson, keeping him detained on the ship.\n\nPartly through the influence of John Adams, who was still serving as a commissioner in France, Simpson was released from Jones's accusation. Adams implies in his memoirs that the overwhelming majority of the evidence supported Simpson's claims. Adams seemed to believe Jones was hoping to monopolize the mission's glory, especially by detaining Simpson on board while he celebrated the capture with numerous important European dignitaries.\n\nEven with the wealth of perspectives, including the commander's, it is difficult if not impossible to tell exactly what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who might well have been motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable, and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, \"Ranger\"s capture of \"Drake\" was one of the Continental Navy's few significant military victories during the Revolution. \"Ranger\"s victory became an important symbol of the American spirit and served as an inspiration for the permanent establishment of the United States Navy after the revolution.\n\nIn 1779, Captain Jones took command of the 42-gun , a merchant ship rebuilt and given to America by the French shipping magnate, Jacques-Donatien Le Ray. On August 14, as a vast French and Spanish invasion fleet approached England, he provided a diversion by heading for Ireland at the head of a five ship squadron including the 36-gun , 32-gun USS \"Pallas\", 12-gun , and \"Le Cerf\", also accompanied by two privateers, and \"Granville\". When the squadron was only a few days out of Groix, \"Monsieur\" separated due to a disagreement between her captain and Jones. Several Royal Navy warships were sent towards Ireland in pursuit of Jones, but on this occasion, he continued right around the north of Scotland into the North Sea. Jones's main problems, as on his previous voyage, resulted from insubordination, particularly by Pierre Landais, captain of \"Alliance\". On September 23, 1779, the squadron met a large merchant convoy off the coast of Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire. The 50-gun British frigate and the 22-gun hired armed ship placed themselves between the convoy and Jones's squadron, allowing the merchants to escape.\n\nShortly after 7 p.m. the Battle of Flamborough Head began. \"Serapis\" engaged \"Bonhomme Richard\", and soon afterwards, \"Alliance\" fired, from a considerable distance, at \"Countess\". Quickly recognizing that he could not win a battle of big guns, and with the wind dying, Jones made every effort to lock \"Richard\" and \"Serapis\" together (his famous, albeit possibly apocryphal, quotation \"I have not yet begun to fight!\" was uttered in reply to a demand to surrender in this phase of the battle), finally succeeding after about an hour, following which his deck guns and his Marine marksmen in the rigging began clearing the British decks. \"Alliance\" sailed past and fired a broadside, doing at least as much damage to \"Richard\" as to \"Serapis\". Meanwhile, \"Countess of Scarborough\" had enticed \"Pallas\" downwind of the main battle, beginning a separate engagement. When \"Alliance\" approached this contest, about an hour after it had begun, the badly damaged \"Countess\" surrendered.\nWith \"Bonhomme Richard\" burning and sinking, it seems that her ensign was shot away; when one of the officers, apparently believing his captain to be dead, shouted a surrender, the British commander asked, seriously this time, if they had struck their colours. Jones later remembered saying something like \"I am determined to make you strike\", but the words allegedly heard by crew-members and reported in newspapers a few days later were more like: \"I may sink, but I'll be damned if I strike\". An attempt by the British to board \"Bonhomme Richard\" was thwarted, and a grenade caused the explosion of a large quantity of gunpowder on \"Serapis\" lower gun-deck.\n\"Alliance\" returned to the main battle, firing two broadsides. Again, these did at least as much damage to \"Richard\" as to \"Serapis\", but the tactic worked to the extent that, unable to move, and with \"Alliance\" keeping well out of the line of his own great guns, Captain Pearson of \"Serapis\" accepted that prolonging the battle could achieve nothing, so he surrendered. Most of \"Bonhomme Richard\"s crew immediately transferred to other vessels, and after a day and a half of frantic repair efforts, it was decided that the ship could not be saved, so it was allowed to sink, and Jones took command of \"Serapis\" for the trip to neutral (but American-sympathizing) Holland.\n\nIn the following year, the King of France Louis XVI, honored him with the title \"Chevalier\". Jones accepted the honor, and desired the title to be used thereafter: when the Continental Congress in 1787 resolved that a medal of gold be struck in commemoration of his \"valor and brilliant services\" it was to be presented to \"Chevalier John Paul Jones\". He also received from Louis XVI a decoration of \"l'Institution du Mérite Militaire\" and a sword. By contrast, in Britain at this time, he was usually denigrated as a pirate.\n\nIn June 1782, Jones was appointed to command the 74-gun , but his command fell through when Congress decided to give \"America\" to the French as replacement for the wrecked \"Le Magnifique\". As a result, he was given assignment in Europe in 1783 to collect prize money due his former hands. At length, this too expired and Jones was left without prospects for active employment, leading him on April 23, 1787 to enter into the service of the Empress Catherine II of Russia, who placed great confidence in Jones, saying: \"He will get to Constantinople\". He was granted name as a French subject Павел де Жонес (\"Pavel de Zhones\", Paul de Jones).\n\nJones avowed his intention, however, to preserve the condition of an American citizen and officer. As a rear admiral aboard the 24-gun flagship \"Vladimir\", he took part in the naval campaign in the Dnieper-Bug Liman (an arm of the Black Sea, into which flow the Southern Bug and Dnieper rivers) against the Turks, in concert with the Dnieper Flotilla commanded by Prince Charles of Nassau-Siegen. Jones (and Nassau-Siegen) repulsed the Ottoman forces from the area, but the jealous intrigues of Nassau-Siegen (and perhaps Jones's own inaptitude for Imperial politics) turned the Russian commander Prince Grigory Potëmkin against Jones and he was recalled to St. Petersburg for the pretended purpose of being transferred to a command in the North Sea. Another factor may have been the resentment of several ex-British naval officers also in Russian employment, who regarded Jones as a renegade and refused to speak to him. Whatever motivated the Prince, once recalled he was compelled to remain in idleness, while rival officers plotted against him and even maliciously assailed his private character through accusations of sexual misconduct. In April 1789 Jones was arrested and accused of raping a 12-year-old girl named Katerina Goltzwart. But the Count de Segur, the French representative at the Russian court (and also Jones's last friend in the capital), conducted his own personal investigation into the matter and was able to convince Potëmkin that the girl had not been raped and that Jones had been accused by Prince de Nassau-Siegen for his own purposes; Jones, however, admitted to prosecutors that he had \"often frolicked\" with the girl \"for a small cash payment\", only denying that he had deprived her of her virginity. Even so, in that period he was able to author his \"Narrative of the Campaign of the Liman\".\n\nOn June 8, 1788, Jones was awarded the Order of St. Anne, but he left the following month, an embittered man.\n\nIn 1789 Jones arrived in Warsaw, Poland, where he befriended Tadeusz Kościuszko, another veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Kościuszko advised him to leave the service of the autocratic Russia, and serve another power, suggesting Sweden. Despite Kościuszko's backing, the Swedes, while somewhat interested, in the end decided not to recruit Jones.\n\nIn May 1790, Jones arrived in Paris. He still retained his position as Russian rear admiral, with a corresponding pension which allowed him to remain in retirement until his death two years later, although he made a number of attempts to re-enter the service in the Russian navy. By this time, his memoirs had been published in Edinburgh. Inspired by them, James Fenimore Cooper and Alexandre Dumas later wrote their own adventure novels. \nAccording to Walter Herrick:\n\nIn June 1792, Jones was appointed U.S. Consul to treat with the Dey of Algiers for the release of American captives. Before Jones was able to fulfill his appointment, he was found dead lying face-down on his bed in his third-floor Paris apartment, No. 19 Rue de Tournon, on July 18, 1792. He was 45 years old. The cause of death was interstitial nephritis. A small procession of servants, friends and loyal family walked his body the for burial. He was buried in Paris at the Saint Louis Cemetery, which belonged to the French royal family. Four years later, France's revolutionary government sold the property and the cemetery was forgotten. In 1906, the corporeal remains of John Paul Jones were interred into the crypt beneath the Annapolis, Maryland, Naval Academy in a ceremony presided over by President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1905, Jones's remains were identified by U.S. Ambassador to France Gen. Horace Porter, who had searched for six years to track down the body using faulty copies of Jones's burial record.\n\nAfter Jones's death, Frenchman Pierrot Francois Simmoneau donated over 460 francs to mummify the body. It was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin \"in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified.\" Porter knew what to look for in his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.\n\nJones's body was brought to the United States aboard the , escorted by three other cruisers. On approaching the American coastline, seven U.S. Navy battleships joined the procession escorting Jones's body back to America. On April 24, 1906, Jones's coffin was installed in Bancroft Hall at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, following a ceremony in Dahlgren Hall, presided over by President Theodore Roosevelt who gave a speech paying tribute to Jones and holding him up as an example to the officers of the Navy. On January 26, 1913, the Captain's remains were finally re-interred in a magnificent bronze and marble sarcophagus at the Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis.\n\nJones was given an honorary pardon in 1999 by the Port of Whitehaven for his raid on the town, in the presence of Lt. Steve Lyons representing the US Naval Attaché to the UK, and Yuri Fokine the Russian Ambassador to the UK. The US Navy were also awarded the Freedom of the Port of Whitehaven, the only time the honour has been granted in its 400-year history.\n\nThe Pardon and Freedom were arranged by Gerard Richardson MBE as part of the launch of the series of Maritime Festival. Richardson's of Whitehaven is now the honorary Consulate to the US Navy for the Town and Port of Whitehaven. The Consul is Rear Admiral (retired) US Navy, Steve Morgan and the Deputy Consul is Rob Romano.\n\nBULLET::::- The 1824 novel \"\" by James Fenimore Cooper contains fictionalized accounts of Jones's maritime activities.

{"id": "16343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16343", "title": "Boulting brothers", "text": "Boulting brothers\n\nJohn Edward Boulting (21 December 1913 – 17 June 1985) and Roy Alfred Clarence Boulting (21 December 1913 – 5 November 2001), known collectively as the Boulting brothers, were English filmmakers and identical twins who became known for their popular series of satirical comedies in the 1950s and 1960s. They produced many of their films through their own production company, Charter Film Productions, which they set up in 1937.\n\nThe twin brothers were born to Arthur Boulting and his wife Rosetta (Rose) \"née\" Bennett in Bray, Berkshire, England on 21 December 1913. John was the elder by half an hour. John was named Joseph Edward John Boulting and Roy was named Alfred Fitzroy Clarence Boulting. Their elder brother Sydney Boulting became an actor and stage producer as Peter Cotes; he was the original director of \"The Mousetrap\". A younger brother, Guy, died aged eight.\n\nBoth twins were educated at Reading School, where they formed a film society. They were extras in Anthony Asquith's 1931 film \"Tell England\" while still at school.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, John served with the International Brigades as an ambulance driver, where—according to Richard Attenborough—Boulting was nearly captured.\n\nThe brothers constitute one of those producer-director teams responsible for much notable British cinema. For most of their careers one produced while the other directed, but the product remained essentially a 'Boulting Brothers film'. They were socialists, as John demonstrated with the International Brigades, and wanted all film, including comedies, to reflect the real world.\n\nIn 1937, they set up Charter Film Productions and made several short features, including \"The Landlady\" (1937) and \"Consider Your Verdict\" (1938), which attracted critical and commercial attention.\n\nThey made quota quickies such as \"Trunk Crime\" (1939) and \"Inquest\" (1939).\n\nBeing eager to speak out against the Third Reich, the brothers made their major film, \"Pastor Hall (1940)\", a biopic of Martin Niemöller, a German preacher who refuses to kowtow to the Nazis. Roy directed and John produced. The film had to have its initial release delayed by the British Government, which was not yet ready to be openly critical of Nazism. Once released, the film was well received by the critics and the public.\n\nThey followed up with \"Thunder Rock (1942)\" with Michael Redgrave, a passionate anti-isolationist allegory distinguished by imaginative cinematography and a theatrical but highly atmospheric lighthouse setting. It was financed by MGM.\n\nIn 1941 Roy joined the Army Film Unit, where he was responsible for the enormously influential \"Desert Victory\" - which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1944. He also worked on \"Tunisian Victory\" (1944) and \"Burma Victory\" (1945).\n\nJohn joined the RAF Film Unit, where he made \"Journey Together\" in 1945, a dramatised documentary about the training and combat experience of a bomber crew with Richard Attenborough in the lead part. Terence Rattigan worked on the script.\n\nAfter the war the Boultings made the drama \"Fame Is the Spur\" (1947) with Redgrave. More popular was \"Brighton Rock\" (1947), starring Attenborough as the gangster \"Pinkie\" from the novel by Graham Greene, which has become a classic.\n\nAlso well liked was the comedy \"The Guinea Pig\" (1948), starring Richard Attenborough as a young working class boy sent to a public school. It was made for Pilgrim Pictures who the Boultings left shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Boultings co-directed the thriller \"Seven Days to Noon\" (1950), which won an Oscar for Best Story. It led to a less popular sequel, \"High Treason\" (1951).\n\nJohn directed \"The Magic Box\" (1951), a biopic of William Friese-Greene notable for the number of cameos in its cast. It was a box office disappointment.\n\nRoy received an offer to direct a World War Two naval film, \"Sailor of the King\" (1953), starring Jeffrey Hunter for 20th Century Fox. \"Seagulls Over Sorrento\" (1954) was another war naval story financed by a Hollywood studio (in this case MGM) with an imported star (Gene Kelly); it was not a big success.\n\nThe brothers collaborated on a comedy, \"Josephine and Men\" (1955) then Roy was hired by United Artists to do an action film with Hollywood stars, \"Run for the Sun\" (1956).\n\nIn the mid-50s the Boultings quickly became identified with \"affectionate\" satires on various British institutions. it started with John's \"Private's Progress\" (1956), a look at army life, starring Attenborough, Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael and co written by Frank Harvey. It was the second most popular film in Britain in 1956.\n\nThey followed it with \"Lucky Jim\" (1957), a look at academia from the novel by Kingsley Amis. It starred Carmichael and Terry Thomas. \"Brothers in Law\" (1957) with Carmichael, Attenborough and Thomas, took on the legal profession.\n\nThey had a break from satirising institutions with \"Happy Is the Bride\" (1958), an adaptation of \"Quiet Wedding\", then returned to it with \"Carlton-Browne of the F.O.\" (1959), a send up of diplomacy.\n\nThe Boultings took on increasingly powerful trade unions and ever corrupt board room power with \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959), a sequel to \"Private's Progress\" with Carmichael, Thomas and Attenborough reprising their roles, and Harvey co-writing. The film was also notable for the performance of Peter Sellers as trade union foreman Fred Kite. It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1959.\n\n\"Suspect\" (1960) was a return to the thriller genre for the brothers. \"A French Mistress\" (1960) was a comedy farce.\n\n\"Heavens Above!\" (1963) was a look at religion in Britain, starring Sellers and Carmichael. It was a minor hit.\n\n\"Rotten to the Core\" (1965) was a heist comedy which attempted to make a star of Anton Rodgers in a Peter Sellers-type role, playing multiple parts. It featured a young Charlotte Rampling.\n\nThe Boultings directed and produced the northern comedy \"The Family Way\" (1966), starring John Mills and his teenage daughter Hayley. Roy Boulting and Hayley Mills began a relationship during the shoot despite a 33-year age difference; they married in 1971.\n\nRoy wrote and directed \"Twisted Nerve\" (1968), a thriller starring Mills and Hywel Bennett. The brothers had a massive hit with \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" (1970) starring Sellers and Goldie Hawn.\n\nRoy was called in to replace the director on \"Mr. Forbush and the Penguins\" (1971), and he brought in Mills to star. The movie was not successful. Neither was the comedy \"Soft Beds, Hard Battles\" (1974) made by the brothers starring Peter Sellers. Roy Boulting lost a considerable amount of money on the film.\n\nIn 1975 Roy was working on a stage play, \"The Family Games\". He worked on the script for \"The Kingfisher Caper\" (1975), starring Mills.\n\nIn the US, Roy directed \"The Last Word\" (1979), a comedy starring Richard Harris that was barely seen.\n\nWhen John died of cancer in 1985, Roy stopped making films. His last credit was directing an episode of the \"Miss Marple\" series for TV, \"The Moving Finger\" (1985). He was working on an adaptation of Terence Rattigan's play \"Deja Vu\" when he died.\n\nWhen the National Film Theatre mounted its biggest retrospective to date of British cinema in the late 1980s, Roy who launched it, introduced \"Desert Victory\". The Boulting Brother's films are regarded by film historians as \"a sensitive barometer of the changing times.\"\n\nJohn Boulting was married four times and had three sons and three daughters.\nJohn and his South African-born wife Anne had two daughters: one of whom is Lucy Boulting Hill, a successful casting director. John's grandson Jordan Stephens (son of Emma Boulting) is one half of British hip hop duo Rizzle Kicks.\n\nRoy Boulting was married five times and had seven sons.\nIn 1951, Roy married Enid Munnik (née Groenewald/Grunewald), later known as Enid Boulting (later wife of 9th Earl of Hardwicke), an established fashion model and fashion editor at the French magazine \"Elle\". Ingrid Boulting is Enid's daughter from a previous marriage. Together, they had three children: the eldest, Fitzroy (b. 1951), then identical twins named Edmund and Rupert (b. 1952).\nIn 1971, Roy married Hayley Mills, 33 years his junior, whom he had met on the set of \"The Family Way\". Their son is musician and filmmaker Crispian Mills. The couple separated in 1975, and divorced in 1977.\n\nJohn Boulting died on 17 June 1985 at his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, and Roy Boulting 16 years later on 5 November 2001 in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford; both died of cancer.\n\nA still from \"The Family Way\" was used for The Smiths single \"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\".\n\nBULLET::::- \"Seven Days to Noon\" (1950)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Journey Together\" (1945)\nBULLET::::- \"Brighton Rock\" (1947)\nBULLET::::- \"The Magic Box\" (1951)\nBULLET::::- \"Private's Progress\" (1956)\nBULLET::::- \"Lucky Jim\" (1957)\nBULLET::::- \"I'm All Right Jack\" (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"Heavens Above!\" (1963)\nBULLET::::- \"Rotten to the Core\" (1965)\nBULLET::::- \"The Number / The Last Word\" (1979)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Trunk Crime\" (1939)\nBULLET::::- \"Inquest\" (1940)\nBULLET::::- \"Thunder Rock\" (1942)\nBULLET::::- \"Tunisian Victory\" (1944, documentary co-directed with Frank Capra)\nBULLET::::- \"Fame is the Spur\" (1947)\nBULLET::::- \"The Guinea Pig / The Outsider\" (1948)\nBULLET::::- \"High Treason\" (1951)\nBULLET::::- \"Single-Handed / Sailor of the King\" (1953)\nBULLET::::- \"Seagulls Over Sorrento / Crest of the Wave\" (1954)\nBULLET::::- \"Josephine and Men\" (1955)\nBULLET::::- \"Run for the Sun\" (1956)\nBULLET::::- \"Brothers in Law\" (1957)\nBULLET::::- \"Happy Is the Bride\" (1958)\nBULLET::::- \"Carlton-Browne of the FO\" (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"Suspect / The Risk\" (1960)\nBULLET::::- \"A French Mistress\" (1960)\nBULLET::::- \"The Family Way\" (1966)\nBULLET::::- \"Twisted Nerve\" (1968)\nBULLET::::- \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" (1970)\nBULLET::::- \"Mr. Forbush and the Penguins / Cry of the Penguins\" (1971)\nBULLET::::- \"Soft Beds, Hard Battles\" (1973)\n\nBULLET::::- Burton Alan, O'Sullivan Tim, Wells Paul; Eds. 2000. \"The Family Way: The Boulting Brothers and British Film Culture\".

{"id": "16345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16345", "title": "John Frankenheimer", "text": "John Frankenheimer\n\nJohn Michael Frankenheimer (February 19, 1930 – July 6, 2002) was an American film and television director known for social dramas and action/suspense films. Among his credits were \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" (1962), \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962), \"Seven Days in May\" (1964), \"The Train\" (1965), \"Seconds\" (1966), \"Grand Prix\" (1966), \"French Connection II\" (1975), \"Black Sunday\" (1977), and \"Ronin\" (1998).\n\nHe won four Emmy Awards—three consecutive—in the 1990s for directing the television movies \"Against the Wall\", \"The Burning Season\", \"Andersonville\", and \"George Wallace\", the last of which also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. \n\nFrankenheimer's 30 feature films and over 50 plays for television were notable for their influence on contemporary thought. He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller\", having begun his career at the peak of the Cold War.\n\nHe was technically highly accomplished from his days in live television; many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.\n\nMovie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment—things that were facing us all.\"\n\nFrankenheimer was born in Queens, New York City, the son of Helen Mary (\"née\" Sheedy) and Walter Martin Frankenheimer, a stockbroker. Frankenheimer once speculated he might be related to actress Ally Sheedy. His father was of German Jewish descent, his mother was Irish Catholic, and Frankenheimer was raised in his mother's religion.\n\nHe grew up in New York City and became interested in movies at an early age; he recalled going to the cinema every weekend. In 1947, he graduated from La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, Long Island, New York. In 1951, he graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he had studied English. He also developed an interest in acting as a career while in college but began thinking seriously about directing when he was in the Air Force.\n\nThis led him to join a film squadron based in Burbank, California, where he shot his first documentary. He also began studying film theory by reading books about other famous directors, such as Sergei Eisenstein along with how-to books about the craft of film making.\n\nFrankenheimer began his directing career in live television at CBS. Throughout the 1950s he directed over 140 episodes of shows like \"Playhouse 90\", \"Climax!\", and \"Danger\", including \"The Comedian\", written by Rod Serling and starring Mickey Rooney as a ragingly vicious television comedian.\n\nFrankenheimer's first theatrical film was \"The Young Stranger\" (1957), starring James MacArthur as the rebellious teenage son of a powerful Hollywood movie producer. He directed the production, based on a \"Climax!\" episode, \"Deal a Blow\", which he directed when he was 26. Frankenheimer returned to television during the late 1950s, moving to film permanently in 1961 with \"The Young Savages\", in which he worked for the first time with Burt Lancaster in a story of a young boy murdered by a New York gang. His departure from television is considered to signal the end of the Golden Age of Television.\n\nRoger Ebert considered Frankenheimer to have had a special gift as a filmmaker and to have been a \"master craftsman\". He stated that Frankenheimer made some of the \"most distinctive films of his time\" and that he was \" one of the most gifted directors of drama on television\".\n\nProduction of \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" began under director Charles Crichton. Burt Lancaster, who was producing, as well as starring, asked Frankenheimer to take over the film. As Frankenheimer describes in Charles Champlin's interview book, he advised Lancaster that the script was too long, but was told he had to shoot all that was written.\n\nThe first cut of the film was four-and-a-half hours long, the length Frankenheimer had predicted. Moreover, the film was constructed so that it could not be cut and still be coherent. Frankenheimer said the film would have to be rewritten and partly reshot. Lancaster was committed to star in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", so he made that film while Frankenheimer prepared the reshoots. The finished film, released in 1962, was a huge success and was nominated for four Oscars, including one for Lancaster's performance.\n\nFrankenheimer was next hired by producer John Houseman to direct \"All Fall Down\", a family drama starring Eva Marie Saint and Warren Beatty. Due to production difficulties with \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", \"All Fall Down\" was released first.\n\nFrankenheimer followed this with his most famous and best-regarded film, \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). Frankenheimer and producer George Axelrod bought Richard Condon's 1959 novel after it had already been turned down by many Hollywood studios. After Frank Sinatra committed to the film, they secured backing from United Artists. The story of a Korean War veteran, brainwashed by the Communist Chinese to assassinate a candidate for President, co-starred Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, James Gregory, John McGiver, and Angela Lansbury.\n\nFrankenheimer had to fight to cast Lansbury who had worked with him on \"All Fall Down\" and was only three years older than Harvey, who would play her son in the film. Sinatra's preference had initially been for Lucille Ball. The film was nominated for two Oscars, including one for Lansbury.\n\nThe film was unseen, either theatrically or on broadcast, for many years. Urban legend has it that the film was pulled from circulation due to the similarity of its plot to the death of President Kennedy the following year, but Frankenheimer states in the Champlin book that it was pulled because of a legal battle between the producer, Sinatra, and the studio over Sinatra's share of the profits. In any event, it was re-released to great acclaim in 1988.\n\nFrankenheimer followed with another successful political thriller, \"Seven Days in May\" (1964). He again bought the rights to a bestselling book, this time by Charles Bailey II and Fletcher Knebel, and again produced the film with his star, this time Kirk Douglas. Douglas intended to play the role of the General who attempts to lead a coup against the President, who is about to sign a disarmament treaty with the Soviets. Douglas then decided he wanted to work with Burt Lancaster, with whom he had just costarred in another film. To entice Lancaster, Douglas agreed to let him play the General, while Douglas took the less showy lead role of the General's aide, who turns against him and helps the President.\n\nThe film, written by Rod Serling, also starred Fredric March as the President and Ava Gardner as a former flame of Lancaster's character. It was nominated for two Oscars.\n\n\"The Train\" (1964) had already begun shooting in France when star Lancaster had Arthur Penn, the original director, fired and called in Frankenheimer to save the film. As he recounts in the Champlin book, Frankenheimer used the production's desperation to his advantage in negotiations. He successfully demanded that his name be made part of the title, \"John Frankenheimer's The Train\"; that the French co-director, required by French tax laws, never be allowed to be on the film's set; that he be given total final cut on the film; and that he receive a Ferrari.\n\nAgain saddled with an unworkably long script, Frankenheimer threw it out and took the locations and actors left from the previous film and began filming, with writers working in Paris as the production shot in Normandy. The poorly chosen locations caused endless weather delays. The film contains multiple real train wrecks. The Allied bombing of a rail yard was accomplished with real dynamite, as the French rail authority needed to enlarge the track gauge. This can be observed by the shockwaves traveling through the ground during the action sequence. Producers realized after filming that the story needed another action scene, and reassembled some of the cast for a Spitfire attack scene that was inserted into the first third of the film. The script was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\"Seconds\" (1966) tells of an older man (John Randolph) given the body of a young man (Rock Hudson) through experimental surgery. It was poorly received on its release but has come to be one of the director's most respected and popular films subsequently. The film is an expressionistic, part-horror, part-thriller, part-science fiction film about the obsession with eternal youth and misplaced faith in the ability of medical science to achieve it.\n\nThe director of photography for \"Seconds\" was the highly regarded James Wong Howe, who is well known for pioneering novel techniques in black-and-white cinematography, and whose prolific career spanned nearly five decades. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on the film. \"Seconds\" was Frankenheimer and Howe's last film in black-and-white. All of Frankenheimer's films until \"Grand Prix\" had been made in black-and-white.\n\nFrankenheimer followed \"Seconds\" with his most spectacular production, 1966's \"Grand Prix\". Shot on location at the Grand Prix races throughout Europe, using 65mm Cinerama cameras, the film starred James Garner and Eva Marie Saint. The making was a race itself, as John Sturges and Steve McQueen planned to make a similar movie titled \"Day of the Champion\".\n\nDue to their contract with the German Nürburgring, Frankenheimer had to turn over 27 reels shot there to Sturges. Frankenheimer was ahead in schedule anyway, and the McQueen/Sturges project was called off, while the German race track was only mentioned briefly in \"Grand Prix\". Introducing methods of photographing high-speed auto racing that had never been seen before, mounting cameras on the cars, at full speed and putting the stars in the actual cars, instead of against rear-projections, the film was an international success and won three Oscars, for editing, sound, and sound effects.\n\nFrankenheimer's next film, 1967's all-star anti-war comedy \"The Extraordinary Seaman\", starred David Niven, Faye Dunaway, Alan Alda and Mickey Rooney. The film was a failure at the box office and critically. Frankenheimer calls it in the Champlin book \"the only movie I've made which I would say was a total disaster.\"\n\nFollowing this the next year was \"The Fixer\", about a Jew in Tsarist Russia and based on the novel by Bernard Malamud. The film was shot in Communist Hungary. It starred Alan Bates and was not a major success, but Bates was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nFrankenheimer became a close friend of Senator Robert F. Kennedy during the making of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" in 1962. In 1968, Kennedy asked Frankenheimer to make some commercials for use in the presidential campaign, at which he hoped to become the Democratic candidate. On the night he was assassinated in June 1968, it was Frankenheimer who had driven Kennedy from Los Angeles Airport to the Ambassador Hotel for his acceptance speech.\n\n\"The Gypsy Moths\" was a romantic drama about a troupe of barnstorming skydivers and their impact on a small midwestern town. The celebration of Americana starred Frankenheimer regular Lancaster, reuniting him with \"From Here to Eternity\" co-star Deborah Kerr, and it also featured Gene Hackman. The film failed to find an audience, but Frankenheimer claimed it was one of his favorites.\n\nFrankenheimer followed this with \"I Walk the Line\" in 1970. The film, starring Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld, about a Tennessee sheriff who falls in love with a moonshiner's daughter, was set to songs by Johnny Cash. Frankenheimer's next project took him to Afghanistan. \"The Horseman\" focused on the relationship between a father and son, played by Jack Palance and Omar Sharif. Sharif's character, an expert horseman, played the Afghan national sport of buzkashi.\n\n\"Impossible Object\", also known as \"Story of a Love Story\", suffered distribution difficulties and was not widely released. Next came a four-hour film of O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\", in 1973, starring Lee Marvin, and the decidedly offbeat \"99 and 44/100% Dead\", a crime black comedy starring Richard Harris.\n\nWith his fluent French and knowledge of French culture, Frankenheimer was asked to direct \"French Connection II\", set entirely in Marseille. With Hackman reprising his role as New York cop Popeye Doyle, the film was a success and got Frankenheimer his next job. \"Black Sunday\", based on author Thomas Harris's only non-Hannibal Lecter novel, involves an Israeli Mossad agent (Robert Shaw) chasing a pro-Palestinian terrorist (Marthe Keller) and a disgruntled Vietnam vet (Bruce Dern), who plan to blow up the Goodyear blimp over the Super Bowl. It was shot on location at the actual Super Bowl X in January 1976 in Miami, with the use of a real Goodyear Blimp. The film tested very highly, and Paramount and Frankenheimer had high expectations for it but it was not a hit.\n\nFrankenheimer is quoted in Champlin's biography as saying that his alcohol problem caused him to do work that was below his own standards on \"Prophecy\" (1979), an ecological monster movie about a mutant grizzly bear terrorizing a forest in Maine.\n\nIn 1981, Frankenheimer travelled to Japan to shoot the cult martial-arts action film \"The Challenge\", with Scott Glenn and legendary Japanese star Toshiro Mifune. He told Champlin that his drinking became so severe while shooting in Japan that he actually drank on set, which he had never done before, and as a result he entered rehab on returning to America. The film was released in 1982, along with his HBO television adaptation of the acclaimed play \"The Rainmaker\".\n\nIn 1985, Frankenheimer directed an adaptation of the Robert Ludlum bestseller \"The Holcroft Covenant\", starring Michael Caine. That was followed the next year with another adaptation, \"52 Pick-Up\", from the novel by Elmore Leonard. \"Dead Bang\" (1989) followed Don Johnson as he infiltrated a group of white supremacists. In 1990, he returned to the Cold War political thriller genre with \"The Fourth War\" with Roy Scheider (with whom Frankenheimer had worked previously on \"52 Pick-Up\") as a loose cannon Army colonel drawn into a dangerous personal war with a Soviet officer. It was not a commercial success.\n\nMost of his 1980s films were less than successful, both critically and financially, but Frankenheimer was able to make a comeback in the 1990s by returning to his roots in television. He directed two films for HBO in 1994: \"Against the Wall\" and \"The Burning Season\" that won him several awards and renewed acclaim. The director also helmed two films for Turner Network Television, \"Andersonville\" (1996) and \"George Wallace\" (1997), that were highly praised.\n\nFrankenheimer's 1996 film \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", which he took over after the firing of original director Richard Stanley, was the cause of countless stories of production woes and personality clashes and received scathing reviews. Frankenheimer was said to be unable to stand Val Kilmer, the young co-star of the film and whose disruption had reportedly led to the removal of Stanley half a week into production. When Kilmer's last scene was completed, Frankenheimer reportedly said, \"Now get that bastard off my set.\" The veteran director also professed that \"Will Rogers never met Val Kilmer\". In an interview, Frankenheimer refused to discuss the film, saying only that he had a miserable time making it.\n\nHowever, his next film, 1998's \"Ronin\", starring Robert De Niro, was a return to form, featuring Frankenheimer's now trademark elaborate car chases woven into a labyrinthine espionage plot. Co-starring an international cast including Jean Reno and Jonathan Pryce, it was a critical and box-office success. As the 1990s drew to a close, he even had a rare acting role, appearing in a cameo as a U.S. general in \"The General's Daughter\" (1999). He earlier had an uncredited cameo as a TV director in his 1977 film \"Black Sunday\".\n\nFrankenheimer's last theatrical film, 2000's \"Reindeer Games\", starring Ben Affleck, underperformed. But then came his final film, \"Path to War\" for HBO in 2002, which brought him back to his strengths – political machinations, 1960s America and character-based drama, and was nominated for numerous awards. A look back at the Vietnam War, it starred Michael Gambon as President Lyndon Johnson along with Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland. One of Frankenheimer's last projects was the 2001 BMW action short-film \"Ambush\" for the promotional series \"The Hire\", starring Clive Owen.\n\nFrankenheimer was scheduled to direct \"\", but it was announced before filming started that he was withdrawing, citing health concerns. Paul Schrader replaced him. About a month later he died suddenly in Los Angeles, California, from a stroke due to complications following spinal surgery at the age of 72.\n\nThe moving image collection of John Frankenheimer is held at the Academy Film Archive.\n\n!

{"id": "16346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16346", "title": "John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe", "text": "John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, (5 December 1859 – 20 November 1935) was a Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Anglo-Egyptian War and the Boxer Rebellion and commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 during the First World War. His handling of the fleet at that battle was controversial. Jellicoe made no serious mistakes and the German High Seas Fleet retreated to port, at a time when defeat would have been catastrophic for Britain, but the public was disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a more dramatic victory. Jellicoe later served as First Sea Lord, overseeing the expansion of the Naval Staff at the Admiralty and the introduction of convoys, but was relieved at the end of 1917. He also served as the Governor-General of New Zealand in the early 1920s.\n\nBorn the son of John Henry Jellicoe, a captain in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and Lucy Henrietta Jellicoe (née Keele) and educated at Field House School in Rottingdean, Jellicoe joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in the training ship in 1872. He was made a midshipman in the steam frigate in September 1874 before transferring to the ironclad in the Mediterranean Fleet in July 1877. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 5 December 1878, he joined , flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, as signal sub-lieutenant in 1880. Promoted to lieutenant on 23 September 1880, he returned to HMS \"Agincourt\" in February 1881 and commanded a rifle company of the Naval Brigade at Ismailia during the Egyptian war of 1882.\n\nJellicoe qualified as a gunnery officer in 1883 and was appointed to the staff of the gunnery school in May 1884. He joined the turret ship as gunnery officer in September 1885 and was awarded the Board of Trade Silver Medal for rescuing the crew of a capsized steamer near Gibraltar in May 1886. He joined the battleship in April 1886 and was put in charge of the experimental department at HMS \"Excellent\" in December 1886 before being appointed assistant to the Director of Naval Ordnance in September 1889.\nPromoted to commander on 30 June 1891, Jellicoe joined the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1892. He transferred to the battleship in 1893 (the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon) and was aboard when it collided with and was wrecked off Tripoli in Lebanon on 22 June 1893. He was then appointed to the new flagship, , in October 1893.\n\nPromoted to captain on 1 January 1897, Jellicoe became a member of the Admiralty's Ordnance Committee. He served as Captain of the battleship and chief of staff to Vice Admiral Sir Edward Seymour during the Seymour Expedition to relieve the legations at Peking during the Boxer Rebellion in June 1900. He was badly wounded during the Battle of Beicang and told he would die but confounded the attending doctor and chaplain by living. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and given the German Order of the Red Eagle, 2nd class, with Crossed Swords for services rendered in China. \"Centurion\" returned to the United Kingdom in August 1901, and was paid off the following month, when Captain Jellicoe and the crew went on leave. He became Naval Assistant to Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy in February 1902 and was given command of the armoured cruiser on the North America and West Indies Station in August 1903.\n\nAs a protege of Admiral John Fisher, Jellicoe became Director of Naval Ordnance in 1905 and, having been appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of launching of on 10 February 1906, he was also made an Aide-de-Camp to the King on 8 March 1906. Promoted to rear admiral on 8 February 1907, he pushed hard for funds to modernise the navy, supporting the construction of new -type battleships and s. He supported F. C. Dreyer's improvements in gunnery fire-control systems, and favoured the adoption of Dreyer's \"Fire Control Table\", a form of mechanical computer for calculating firing solutions for warships. Jellicoe arranged for the output of naval ordnance to be transferred from the War Office to the Admiralty.\n\nJellicoe was appointed second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet in August 1907, hoisting his flag in the battleship . He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of the King's Review of the Home Fleet in the Solent on 3 August 1907. He went on to be Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy in October 1908 and, having taken part in the funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910, he became Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet in December 1910, hoisting his flag in the battleship . He advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the Coronation of King George V on 19 June 1911 and confirmed in the rank of vice admiral on 18 September 1911. He went on to be Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, hoisting his flag in the battleship , in December 1911 and, having also been appointed commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron in May 1912, joined the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines on 1 August 1912. He became Second Sea Lord in December 1912.\n\nAt the start of the First World War, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, removed Admiral George Callaghan, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet (August 1914). Jellicoe was promoted to full admiral on 4 August 1914 and assigned command of the renamed Grand Fleet in Admiral Callaghan's place, though he was appalled by the treatment of his predecessor. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 8 February 1915.\n\nWhen Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) both had to leave office (May 1915) after their quarrel over the Dardanelles, Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: \"We owe you a debt of gratitude for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, and I hope that never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise\".\n\nJellicoe commanded the British Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, the largest (and only major) clash of dreadnoughts, albeit an indecisive one. His handling of the Grand Fleet during the battle remains controversial, with some historians characterising Jellicoe as too cautious and other historians faulting the battlecruiser commander, Admiral David Beatty, for making various tactical errors. Jellicoe certainly made no significant mistakes during the battle: based on limited intelligence, he correctly deployed the Grand Fleet with a turn to port so as to \"cross the T\" of the German High Seas Fleet as it appeared. After suffering heavy damage from shells, the German fleet turned 180 degrees and headed away from the battle. At the time the British public expressed disappointment that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. Churchill described Jellicoe later as \"the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon\"—essentially hinting that Jellicoe's decision to prefer caution was strategically correct. Nevertheless, he was appointed a member of the Order of Merit on 31 May 1916, advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 17 June 1916 and awarded the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour on 15 September 1916.\n\nJellicoe was appointed First Sea Lord in November 1916. His term of office saw Britain brought within danger of starvation by German unrestricted U-Boat warfare.\n\nAt the War Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1915–16) in November 1916, the admirals present, including Jellicoe, told Lloyd George that convoys presented too large a target for enemy ships, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to \"keep station\" in a convoy. In February 1917, Maurice Hankey wrote a memorandum for Lloyd George calling for the introduction of \"scientifically organised convoys\", almost certainly after being persuaded by Commander Henderson and the Shipping Ministry officials with whom he was in contact. After a breakfast meeting (13 February 1917) with Lloyd George, Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Admirals Jellicoe and Duff agreed to \"conduct experiments\". However, convoys were not in general use until August 1917, by which time shipping losses to U-boats were already falling from their April peak.\n\nJellicoe continued to take a pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July that nothing could be done to defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after he had failed to act on \"secret, but absolutely reliable\" information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the Battle of Caporetto and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.\n\nJellicoe was rather abruptly dismissed by Geddes in December 1917. Before he left for leave on Christmas Eve he received a letter from Geddes demanding his resignation. Geddes' letter stated that he was still in the building and available to talk, but after consulting Admiral Halsey Jellicoe replied in writing that he would \"do what was best for the service\". The move became public knowledge two days later.\n\nThe Christmas holiday, when Parliament was not sitting, provided a good opportunity to remove Jellicoe with a minimum of fuss. Geddes squared matters with the King and with the Grand Fleet commander Admiral Beatty (who had initially written to Jellicoe of his \"dismay\" over his sacking and promised to speak to Geddes, but then did not write to him again for a month) over the holiday. The other Sea Lords talked of resigning (although Jellicoe advised them not to do so), especially when Geddes suggested in a meeting (31 December) that Balfour and Carson had specifically recommended Jellicoe's removal at the 26 October meeting; they had not done so, although Balfour's denial was less than emphatic. There was no trouble from the generals, who had a low opinion of Jellicoe. In the end the Sea Lords remained in place, whilst Carson remained a member of the War Cabinet, resigning in January over Irish Home Rule.\n\nAlthough it was pretended that the decision had been Geddes' alone, he let slip in the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) that he had been conveying \"the decision of the Government\", i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.\n\nAs First Sea Lord Jellicoe was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 21 April 1917, the Russian Order of St. George, 3rd Class on 5 June 1917, the Grand Cross of the Italian Military Order of Savoy on 11 August 1917 and the Grand Cordon of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun on 29 August 1917.\n\nJellicoe was created Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa Flow on 7 March 1918.\n\nIn June 1918, amidst concerns that—following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk—the Germans were about to requisition the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Lloyd George proposed Jellicoe as Allied Supreme Naval Commander in the Mediterranean. The French were in favour of a combined Allied naval command, but the Italians were not, so nothing came of the suggestion.\n\nJellicoe was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 April 1919. He became Governor-General of New Zealand in September 1920 and while there also served as Grand Master of New Zealand's Masonic Grand Lodge. Following his return to England, he was created Earl Jellicoe and Viscount Brocas of Southampton in the County of Southampton on 1 July 1925. He was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire in 1932. He died of pneumonia at his home in Kensington in London on 20 November 1935 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nIn 1919, \"Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem\" with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham was \"Dedicated to Admiral Viscount Jellicoe.\"\n\nThe attempt of his official biographer, Admiral Reginald Bacon, to portray him as the conqueror of the U-Boats is, in John Grigg's view, absurd, as the main decisions were taken by other men. Bacon also claimed that his elevation to a viscountcy on dismissal was a deliberate snub, but in fact Sir John French, the former Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, was only a viscount at the time (both he and Jellicoe became Earls subsequently), whilst Fisher was never more than a Baron. Bacon's neutrality may be questionable as he had himself been sacked by Geddes from command of the Dover Patrol, replaced by Roger Keyes, shortly after Jellicoe's removal.\n\nJellicoe married, at Holy Trinity church, Sloane Street on 1 July 1902, Florence Gwendoline Cayzer, daughter of the shipping magnate Sir Charles Cayzer. His brother Rev. Frederick Jellicoe (1858–1927) conducted the service. Lord and Lady Jellicoe had a son and five daughters. The son George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe had an illustrious military career during the Second World War, followed by prominent careers as parliamentarian and businessman.\n\nRibbon bar (incomplete)\n\nBULLET::::- Viscount Jellicoe, of Scapa in the County of Orkney – 7 March 1918\nBULLET::::- Earl Jellicoe and Viscount Brocas, of Southampton in the County of Southampton – 1 July 1925\n\nBULLET::::- Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) – 8 February 1915 (KCB: 19 June 1911; CB: 9 November 1900)\nBULLET::::- Order of Merit (OM) – 31 May 1916\nBULLET::::- Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) – 17 June 1916 (KCVO: 3 August 1907; CVO: 13 February 1906)\n\nBULLET::::- Sea Gallantry Medal (SGM) – 1886\n\nBULLET::::- Egypt Medal\nBULLET::::- China War Medal (1900)\nBULLET::::- 1914 Star\nBULLET::::- British War Medal\nBULLET::::- World War I Victory Medal\nBULLET::::- King George V Coronation Medal\nBULLET::::- King George V Silver Jubilee Medal\n\nBULLET::::- : Order of the Red Eagle, 2nd class with crossed swords – \"April 1902\"\nBULLET::::- : Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour – \"15 September 1916\"\nBULLET::::- : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold – \"21 April 1917\"\nBULLET::::- : Order of St. George, 3rd Class – \"5 June 1917\"\nBULLET::::- : Grand Cross of the Military Order of Savoy – \"11 August 1917\"\nBULLET::::- : Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers – \"29 August 1917\"\n\nBULLET::::- Navy Distinguished Service Medal of the United States – 16 September 1919\nBULLET::::- Croix de Guerre of France – 21 February 1919\nBULLET::::- Belgian Croix de Guerre – 21 April 1917\n\n+Some of Admiral Jellicoe's ancestors\n\n\n\nBULLET::::- , note the chapters to the right\n"}

He was educated at Stubbington House School, preparatory school in Stubbington, Hampshire. He then continued his education at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon. Woodward married, in 1960, Charlotte McMurtrie (with whom he had a son and a daughter), but in 1993 they separated.\n\nHaving graduated from the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, Woodward joined the Royal Navy in 1946. He became a submariner in 1954, and was promoted to lieutenant that May. In 1960 he passed the Royal Navy's rigorous Submarine Command Course known as \"The Perisher\", and received his first command, the T Class submarine HMS \"Tireless\". Promoted to lieutenant-commander in May 1962, he then commanded HMS \"Grampus\" before becoming the second in command of the nuclear fleet submarine HMS \"Valiant\". In 1967, he was promoted to commander and became the Instructor (known as \"Teacher\") of The Perisher Course. He took command of HMS \"Warspite\" in December 1969. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1972. In 1974, he became Captain of Submarine Training and in 1976 he took command of HMS \"Sheffield\".\n\nHe became Head of Naval Plans in the Ministry of Defence in 1978. In July 1981, he was promoted to rear admiral and appointed as Flag Officer First Flotilla.\n\nIn 1982, he commanded the \"Hermes\" aircraft carrier group, Task Group 317.8, in the Falklands War. (The Commander-in-Chief Fleet Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, served as the Task Force commander, CTF-317. The task group containing the amphibious ships which launched the actual invasion TG 317.0 was commanded by Commodore Michael Clapp, with Task Group 317.1 being the landing force itself.)\n\nHe worked out the timetable for the campaign, starting from the end and working to the start. Knowing that the Argentine forces had to be defeated before the (Southern Hemisphere) winter made conditions too bad, he set a latest date by which the land forces had to be ashore, that in turn set a latest date by which control of the air had to be achieved, and so on.\n\nPossibly the best known single incident was the sinking of the ARA \"General Belgrano\". He knew that \"General Belgrano\" (and particularly her Exocet armed escorts) were a threat to the task force and he ordered that she be sunk. Admiral Sir George Zambellas credited \"Woodward's inspirational leadership and tactical acumen ... [as] a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic\".\n\nFor his efforts during the war Woodward was knighted. He wrote a book entitled \"One Hundred Days\", co-authored by Patrick Robinson, describing his Falklands experiences.\n\nIn 1983, Woodward was appointed Flag Officer Submarines and NATO Commander Submarines Eastern Atlantic. In 1984, he was promoted to vice admiral, and in 1985 he was Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments). Before retirement in 1989 he also served, from 1987, as Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command and Flag Aide-de-Camp to the Queen.\n\nThe first edition of Woodward's memoirs was published in 1992.

He is noted for a distinctive, humorous style, as well as being one of the pioneers of the steampunk genre of science fiction. Blaylock has cited Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens as his inspirations.\n\nHe was born in Long Beach, California; studied English at California State University, Fullerton, receiving an M.A. in 1974; and lives in Orange, California, teaching creative writing at Chapman University. He taught at the Orange County School of the arts until 2013. Many of his books are set in Orange County, California, and can more specifically be termed \"fabulism\"that is, fantastic things happen in our present-day world, rather than in traditional fantasy, where the setting is often some other world. His works have also been categorized as magic realism.\n\nHe and his friends Tim Powers and K. W. Jeter were mentored by Philip K. Dick. Along with Powers, Blaylock invented the poet William Ashbless. Blaylock and Powers have often collaborated with each other on writing stories, including \"The Better Boy\", \"On Pirates\", and \"The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook\".\n\nBlaylock previously served as director of the Creative Writing Conservatory at the Orange County High School of the Arts until 2013, where Powers has also been Writer in Residence.\n\nHe has been married to his wife, Viki Blaylock, for more than 40 years. They have two sons, John and Danny.\n\nBlaylock's short story \"Thirteen Phantasms\" won the 1997 World Fantasy Award for best Short Fiction. \"Paper Dragons\" won the award in 1986. \"Homunculus\" won the Philip K.
