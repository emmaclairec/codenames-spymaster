{"id": "15872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15872", "title": "J. R. R. Tolkien", "text": "J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien (; 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and academic, who is best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works \"The Hobbit\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"The Silmarillion\".\n\nHe served as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\n\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including \"The Silmarillion\". These, together with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within it. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term \"legendarium\" to the larger part of these writings.\n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy. In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". \"Forbes\" ranked him the fifth top-earning \"dead celebrity\" in 2009.\n\nTolkien's immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town Kreuzburg near Königsberg, where his first known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706–1791) moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are descendants of recent refugees from East Prussia who fled the Red Army invasion and subsequent ethnic cleansing.\n\nAccording to Ryszard Derdziński the Tolkien name is of Low Prussian origin and probably means \"son/descendant of Tolk.\" Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word \"tollkühn\", meaning \"foolhardy\", and jokingly inserted himself as a \"cameo\" into \"The Notion Club Papers\" under the literally translated name Rashbold. However, Derdziński has demonstrated this to be a false etymology. While J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of the Tolkien family's German origin, his knowledge of the family's history was limited because he was \"early isolated from the family of his prematurely deceased father\".\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, \"née\" Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.\n\nAs a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some think later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In another incident, a young family servant, who thought Tolkien a beautiful child, took the baby to his kraal to show him off, returning him the next morning.\n\nWhen he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them. This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.\n\nMabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.\n\nTolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked \"Treasure Island\" and \"The Pied Piper\" and thought \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" by Lewis Carroll was \"amusing but disturbing\". He liked stories about \"Red Indians\" (Native Americans) and the fantasy works by George MacDonald. In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.\n\nMabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family, which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J. R. R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could live without treatment—insulin would not be discovered until two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, \"My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"\n\nBefore her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Fr. Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called \"Father Francis\": \"He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was—and he was \"not\". I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more [i.e. Tolkien having grown up knowing more] about 'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus—who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists.\"\n\nAfter his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St. Philip's School. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's. While a pupil there, Tolkien was one of the cadets from the school's Officers Training Corps who helped \"line the route\" for the 1910 coronation parade of King George V. Like the other cadets from King Edward's, Tolkien was posted just outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn Edgbaston, Tolkien lived there in the shadow of Perrott's Folly and the Victorian tower of Edgbaston Waterworks, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the romantic medievalist paintings of Edward Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery had a large collection of works on public display.\n\nWhile in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.\n\nTolkien learned Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears. Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.\n\nIn 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library. After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a \"council\" in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.\n\nIn 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter, noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, \"the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams\". They went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.\n\nIn October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. He initially studied classics but changed his course in 1913 to English language and literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class honours.\n\nAt the age of 16, Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey Carpenter,\nHis guardian, Father Morgan, viewed Edith as the reason for Tolkien's having \"muffed\" his exams and considered it \"altogether unfortunate\" that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, Protestant woman. He prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with her until he was 21. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter, with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled:\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at Cheltenham. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest schoolfriends. But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\". Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at St. Mary Immaculate Roman Catholic Church, Warwick, on 22 March 1916. In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.\n\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the First World War. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to immediately volunteer for the British Army. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"\n\nInstead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\", and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\". He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915. He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\" Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.\n\nOn 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham.\n\nHe later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then ... it was like a death.\"\n\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's (BEF) base depot at Étaples. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division.\n\nWhile waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem entitled \"The Lonely Isle\", which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he also developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.\n\nHe left Étaples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempré, near Amiens. He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire. According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"\n\nTolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"\n\nTolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the Western Front. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers:\n\nOn 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien contracted trench fever, a disease carried by the lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916. Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.\nTolkien might well have been killed himself, but he had suffered from health problems and had been removed from combat multiple times.\n\nAccording to John Garth: \n\nIn later years, Tolkien indignantly declared that those who searched his works for parallels to the Second World War were entirely mistaken:\nA weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.\n\nDuring his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called \"The Book of Lost Tales\", beginning with \"The Fall of Gondolin\". \"Lost Tales\" represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-Boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\".\n\nTolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918. When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,\n\nThis incident inspired the account of the meeting of Beren and Lúthien.\n\nOn 16 July 1919 Tolkien was officially demobilized, at Fovant, on Salisbury Plain, with a temporary disability pension.\n\nOn 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant. His first civilian job after World War I was at the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter \"W\". In 1920, he took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds, becoming the youngest professor there. While at Leeds, he produced \"A Middle English Vocabulary\" and a definitive edition of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" with E. V. Gordon; both became academic standard works for several decades. He translated \"Sir Gawain\", \"Pearl\", and \"Sir Orfeo\". In 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.\n\nIn mid-1919, he began to tutor undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been.\n\nDuring his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote \"The Hobbit\" and the first two volumes of \"The Lord of the Rings\", while living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford (where a blue plaque was placed in 2002). He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \"Nodens\", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.\n\nIn the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of \"Beowulf\", which he finished in 1926, but did not publish. It was finally edited by his son and published in 2014, more than 40 years after Tolkien's death and almost 90 years after its completion.\n\nTen years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, \"\", which had a lasting influence on \"Beowulf\" research. Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about \"Beowulf\" is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements. At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated \"Beowulf\" for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of \"Beowulf\" was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem. Where \"Beowulf\" does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements. In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: \"Beowulf is among my most valued sources\", and this influence may be seen throughout his Middle-earth legendarium.\n\nAccording to Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien had an ingenious means of beginning his series of lectures on \"Beowulf\":\n\nDecades later, W. H. Auden wrote to his former professor,\n\nIn the run-up to the Second World War, Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker. In January 1939, he was asked whether he would be prepared to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency. He replied in the affirmative and, beginning on 27 March, took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School. A record of his training was found which included the notation \"keen\" next to his name, although Tolkien scholar Anders Stenström suggested that \"In all likelihood, that is not a record of Tolkien's interest, but a note about how to pronounce the name.\" He was informed in October that his services would not be required.\n\nIn 1945, Tolkien moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for University College, Dublin, for many years. In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which U.C.D. was a constituent college). Tolkien completed \"The Lord of the Rings\" in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.\n\nTolkien also translated the Book of Jonah for the \"Jerusalem Bible\", which was published in 1966.\n\nThe Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 – 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 – 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (born 21 November 1924) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (born 18 June 1929). Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young. Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.\n\nDuring his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement. At first, he wrote enthusiastic answers to readers' enquiries, but he became increasingly unhappy about the sudden popularity of his books with the 1960s counter-culture movement. In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult-figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"\n\nFan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.\n\nAccording to Humphrey Carpenter:\n\nEdith Tolkien died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. According to Simon Tolkien:\n\nTolkien was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 New Year Honours and received the insignia of the Order at Buckingham Palace on 28 March 1972. In the same year Oxford University conferred upon him an honorary Doctorate of Letters.\n\nTolkien had the name Lúthien engraved on Edith's tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection, at the age of 81, he was buried in the same grave, with Beren added to his name. The engravings read:\n\nIn Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was the most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her immortality for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.\n\nTolkien's will was proven on 20 December 1973, with his estate valued at £190,577 (equivalent to £ in ).\n\nTolkien was a devout Roman Catholic, and in his religious and political views he was mostly a traditionalist moderate, with libertarian, distributist, and monarchist leanings, in the sense of favouring established conventions and orthodoxies over innovation and modernization, whilst castigating government bureaucracy; in 1943 he wrote, \"My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs)—or to 'unconstitutional' Monarchy.\"\n\nAlthough he did not often write or speak about it, Tolkien advocated the dismantling of the British Empire and even of the United Kingdom. In a 1936 letter to a former student, the Belgian linguist Simonne d'Ardenne, he wrote, \"The political situation is dreadful... I have the greatest sympathy with Belgium—which is about the right size of any country! I wish my own were bounded still by the seas of the Tweed and the walls of Wales... we folk do at least know something of mortality and eternity and when Hitler (or a Frenchman) says 'Germany (or France) must live forever' we know that he lies.\"\n\nTolkien had an intense hatred for the side effects of industrialization, which he considered to be devouring the English countryside and simpler life. For most of his adult life, he was disdainful of cars, preferring to ride a bicycle. This attitude can be seen in his work, most famously in the portrayal of the forced \"industrialization\" of the Shire in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nMany commentators have remarked on a number of potential parallels between the Middle-earth saga and events in Tolkien's lifetime. \"The Lord of the Rings\" is often thought to represent England during and immediately after the Second World War. Tolkien ardently rejected this opinion in the foreword to the second edition of the novel, stating he preferred applicability to allegory. This theme is taken up at greater length in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", where he argues that fairy-stories are so apt because they are consistent both within themselves and with some truths about reality. He concludes that Christianity itself follows this pattern of inner consistency and external truth. His belief in the fundamental truths of Christianity leads commentators to find Christian themes in \"The Lord of the Rings\". Tolkien objected strongly to C. S. Lewis's use of religious references in his stories, which were often overtly allegorical. However, Tolkien wrote that the Mount Doom scene exemplified lines from the Lord's Prayer.\n\nHis love of myths and his devout faith came together in his assertion that he believed mythology to be the divine echo of \"the Truth\". This view was expressed in his poem and essay entitled \"Mythopoeia\". His theory that myths held \"fundamental truths\" became a central theme of the Inklings in general.\n\nTolkien's devout Roman Catholic faith was a significant factor in the conversion of C. S. Lewis from atheism to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the Church of England.\n\nHe once wrote in a letter to Rayner Unwin's daughter Camilla, who wished to know what the purpose of life was, that \"[i]t may be said that the chief purpose of life, for any one of us, is to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\"\n\nAccording to his grandson Simon Tolkien, Tolkien in the last years of his life was disappointed by some of the liturgical reforms and changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council:\n\nTolkien voiced support for the Nationalists (eventually led by Franco during the Spanish Civil War) upon hearing that communist Republicans were destroying churches and killing priests and nuns.\n\nTolkien was contemptuous of Joseph Stalin. During World WarII, Tolkien referred to Stalin as \"that bloodthirsty old murderer\". However, in 1961, Tolkien sharply criticized a Swedish commentator who suggested that \"The Lord of the Rings\" was an anti-communist parable and identified Sauron with Stalin. Tolkien said, \"I utterly repudiate any such \"reading\", which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought.\"\n\nTolkien vocally opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party before the Second World War, and was known to especially despise Nazi racist and anti-semitic ideology. In 1938, the publishing house Rütten & Loening Verlag was preparing to release \"The Hobbit\" in Nazi Germany. To Tolkien's outrage, he was asked beforehand whether he was of Aryan origin. In a letter to his British publisher Stanley Unwin, he condemned Nazi \"race-doctrine\" as \"wholly pernicious and unscientific\". He added that he had many Jewish friends and was considering \"letting a German translation go hang\". He provided two letters to Rütten & Loening and instructed Unwin to send whichever he preferred. The more tactful letter was sent and was lost during the later bombing of Germany. In the unsent letter, Tolkien makes the point that \"Aryan\" is a linguistic term, denoting speakers of Indo-Iranian languages. He continued,\n\nIn a 1941 letter to his son Michael, he expressed his resentment at the distortion of Germanic history in \"Nordicism\":\n\nIn 1968, he objected to a description of Middle-earth as \"Nordic\", a term he said he disliked because of its association with racialist theories.\n\nTolkien criticized Allied use of total-war tactics against civilians of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. In a 1945 letter to his son Christopher, he wrote:\n\nHe also reacted with anger to the excesses of anti-German propaganda during World War II. In 1944 he wrote in a letter to his son Christopher:\n\nTolkien was horrified by the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, referring to the scientists of the Manhattan Project as \"these lunatic physicists\" and \"Babel-builders\".\n\nDuring most of his own life conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.\n\nTolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his \"legendarium\", beginning with \"The Book of Lost Tales\", written while recuperating from illnesses contracted during The Battle of the Somme. The two most prominent stories, the tale of Beren and Lúthien and that of Túrin, were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in \"The Lays of Beleriand\").\n\nOne of the greatest influences on Tolkien was the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, from which he took hints for the names of features such as the Dead Marshes in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Mirkwood, along with some general aspects of approach.\n\nEdward Wyke-Smith's \"The Marvellous Land of Snergs\", with its \"table-high\" title characters, strongly influenced the incidents, themes, and depiction of Bilbo's race in \"The Hobbit\".\n\nTolkien also cited H. Rider Haggard's novel \"She\" in a telephone interview: \"I suppose as a boy \"She\" interested me as much as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas [Amenartas], which was the kind of machine by which everything got moving.\" A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the \"Testament of Isildur\" in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the \"Book of Mazarbul\". Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.\n\nTolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy by S. R. Crockett's historical novel \"The Black Douglas\" and of basing the battle with the wargs in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" partly on an incident in it. Incidents in both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are similar in narrative and style to the novel, and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as an influence on Tolkien.\n\nTolkien was inspired by early Germanic, especially Old English, literature, poetry, and mythology, which were his chosen and much-loved areas of expertise. These sources of inspiration included Old English literature such as \"Beowulf\", Norse sagas such as the \"Volsunga saga\" and the \"Hervarar saga\", the \"Poetic Edda\", the \"Prose Edda\", the \"Nibelungenlied\", and numerous other culturally related works. Despite the similarities of his work to the \"Volsunga saga\" and the \"Nibelungenlied\", which were the basis for Richard Wagner's opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", Tolkien dismissed critics' direct comparisons to Wagner, telling his publisher, \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\" However, some critics believe that Tolkien was, in fact, indebted to Wagner for elements such as the \"concept of the Ring as giving the owner mastery of the world ...\" Two of the characteristics possessed by the One Ring, its inherent malevolence and corrupting power upon minds and wills, were not present in the mythical sources but have a central role in Wagner's opera.\n\nTolkien also acknowledged several non-Germanic influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas. Sophocles' play \"Oedipus Rex\" he cited as inspiring elements of \"The Silmarillion\" and \"The Children of Húrin\". In addition, Tolkien first read William Forsell Kirby's translation of the Finnish national epic, the \"Kalevala\", while attending King Edward's School. He described its character of Väinämöinen as one of his influences for Gandalf the Grey. The \"Kalevala\"'s antihero Kullervo was further described as an inspiration for Túrin Turambar. Dimitra Fimi, Douglas A. Anderson, John Garth, and many other prominent Tolkien scholars believe that Tolkien also drew influence from a variety of Celtic (Irish, Scottish and Welsh) history and legends. However, after the \"Silmarillion\" manuscript was rejected, in part for its \"eye-splitting\" Celtic names, Tolkien denied their Celtic origin:\n\nOne of Tolkien's purposes when writing his Middle-earth books was to create what his biographer Humphrey Carpenter called a \"mythology for England\" with Carpenter citing in support Tolkien's letter to Milton Waldman complaining of the \"poverty of my country: it had no stories of its own (bound up with its tongue and soil)\" unlike the Celtic nations of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, which all had their own well developed mythologies. Tolkien himself never used the exact phrase \"a mythology for England\", but he often made statements to that effect, writing to one reader that his intention in writing the Middle-earth stories was \"to restore to the English an epic tradition and present them with a mythology of their own\". In the early 20th century, proponents of Irish nationalism like the poet William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory and others had succeeded in linking in the public mind traditional Irish folk tales of fairies and elves to Irish national identity while denigrating English folk tales as being merely derivative of Irish folk tales. This had prompted a backlash by English writers, leading to a savage war of words about which nation had the more authentic and better fairy tales with for example the English essayist G. K. Chesterton engaging in a series of polemical essays with Yeats over the question of the superiority of Irish vs. English fairy tales. Even though there is nothing innately anti-English about Irish folklore, the way in which Irish mythology became associated with Irish nationalism, being promoted most enthusiastically by those favouring Irish independence, led many to perceive Irish mythology and folklore as Anglophobic. Tolkien with his determination to write a \"mythology for England\" was for this reason disinclined to admit to Celtic influences. Fimi noted in particular that the story of the Noldor, the Elves who fled Valinor for Middle-earth, resembles the story related in the \"Lebor Gabála Érenn\" of the semi-divine Tuatha Dé Danann who fled from what is variously described as a place in the north or Greece to conquer Ireland. Like Tolkien's Elves, the Tuatha Dé Danann are inferior to the gods, but superior to humans; being endowed with extraordinary skills as craftsmen, poets, warriors, and magicians. Likewise, after the triumph of humanity, both the Elves and the Tuatha Dé Danann are driven underground, which causes their \"fading\", leading them to become diminutive and pale.\n\nCatholic theology and imagery played a part in fashioning Tolkien's creative imagination, suffused as it was by his deeply religious spirit. Tolkien acknowledged this himself:\nSpecifically, Paul H. Kocher argues that Tolkien describes evil in the orthodox Christian way as the absence of good. He cites many examples in \"The Lord of the Rings\", such as Sauron's \"Lidless Eye\": \"the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". Kocher sees Tolkien's source as Thomas Aquinas, \"whom it is reasonable to suppose that Tolkien, as a medievalist and a Catholic, knows well\". Tom Shippey makes the same point, but, instead of referring to Aquinas, says Tolkien was very familiar with Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxon translation of Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\", known as the \"Lays of Boethius\". Shippey contends that this Christian view of evil is most clearly stated by Boethius: \"evil is nothing\". He says Tolkien used the corollary that evil cannot create as the basis of Frodo's remark, \"the Shadow ... can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own\", and related remarks by Treebeard and Elrond. He goes on to argue that in \"The Lord of the Rings\" evil does sometimes seem to be an independent force, more than merely the absence of good, and suggests that Alfred's additions to his translation of Boethius may have inspired that view.\n\nStratford Caldecott also interpreted the Ring in theological terms: \"The Ring of Power exemplifies the dark magic of the corrupted will, the assertion of self in disobedience to God. It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly 'thin' and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly hard to give up and corrupting in the long run.\"\n\nAs well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic \"Beowulf\" by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. \"Beowulf\" is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" being adapted from the poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of \"Beowulf\" which Tolkien found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final third of the poem:\n\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.\n\nTolkien focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.\n\nIn addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as \"The Father Christmas Letters\"). Other works included \"Mr. Bliss\" and \"Roverandom\" (for children), and \"Leaf by Niggle\" (part of \"Tree and Leaf\"), \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", \"Smith of Wootton Major\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\". \"Roverandom\" and \"Smith of Wootton Major\", like \"The Hobbit\", borrowed ideas from his \"legendarium\".\n\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called \"The Hobbit\", which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication. When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.\n\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic novel \"The Lord of the Rings\" (originally published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for \"The Lord of the Rings\", during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". Both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" are set against the background of \"The Silmarillion\", but in a time long after it.\n\nTolkien at first intended \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be a children's tale in the style of \"The Hobbit\", but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to \"The Hobbit\", it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in \"The Silmarillion\" and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\n\"The Lord of the Rings\" became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted by the BBC, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was found to be the UK's \"Best-loved Novel\". Australians voted \"The Lord of the Rings\" \"My Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, \"The Lord of the Rings\" was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\". In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd \"greatest Briton\" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the SABC3's Great South Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK's \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be their favourite work of literature.\n\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and Lúthien and of Túrin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the \"Quenta Silmarillion\", an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with \"The Lord of the Rings\", but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring \"The Lord of the Rings\" to be published in three volumes. The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series \"The History of Middle-earth\", edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of \"The Fall of Númenor\", which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis.\n\nTolkien had appointed his son Christopher to be his literary executor, and he (with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as \"The Silmarillion\" in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.\n\nIn 1980, Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title \"Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth\". In subsequent years (1983–1996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called \"The History of Middle-earth\". They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\", the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing \"The Hobbit\" for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose.\n\nOne of Tolkien's least-known short works is the children's storybook \"Mr. Bliss\", published in 1982. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of \"The Hobbit\". The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.\n\nMore recently, in 2007, \"The Children of Húrin\" was published by HarperCollins (in the UK and Canada) and Houghton Mifflin (in the US). The novel tells the story of Túrin Turambar and his sister Nienor, children of Húrin Thalion. The material was compiled by Christopher Tolkien from \"The Silmarillion\", \"Unfinished Tales\", \"The History of Middle-earth\", and unpublished manuscripts.\n\n\"The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún\", which was released worldwide on 5 May 2009 by HarperCollins and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, retells the legend of Sigurd and the fall of the Niflungs from Germanic mythology. It is a narrative poem composed in alliterative verse and is modelled after the Old Norse poetry of the Elder Edda. Christopher Tolkien supplied copious notes and commentary upon his father's work.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, it is no longer possible to trace the exact date of the work's composition. On the basis of circumstantial evidence, he suggests that it dates from the 1930s. In his foreword he wrote, \"He scarcely ever (to my knowledge) referred to them. For my part, I cannot recall any conversation with him on the subject until very near the end of his life, when he spoke of them to me, and tried unsuccessfully to find them.\" In a 1967 letter to W. H. Auden, Tolkien wrote,\n\n\"The Fall of Arthur\", published on 23 May 2013, is a long narrative poem composed by Tolkien in the early-1930s. It is alliterative, extending to almost 1,000 lines imitating the Old English \"Beowulf\" metre in Modern English. Though inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction, the historical setting of the poem is during the Post-Roman Migration Period, both in form (using Germanic verse) and in content, showing Arthur as a British warlord fighting the Saxon invasion, while it avoids the high medieval aspects of the Arthurian cycle (such as the Grail, and the courtly setting); the poem begins with a British \"counter-invasion\" to the Saxon lands (\"Arthur eastward in arms purposed\").\n\n\"\", published on 22 May 2014, is a prose translation of the early medieval epic poem \"Beowulf\" from Old English to modern English. Translated by Tolkien from 1920 to 1926, it was edited by his son Christopher. The translation is followed by over 200 pages of commentary on the poem; this commentary was the basis of Tolkien's acclaimed 1936 lecture \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\". The book also includes the previously unpublished \"Sellic Spell\" and two versions of \"The Lay of Beowulf\". The former is a fantasy piece on Beowulf's biographical background, while the latter is a poem on the Beowulf theme.\n\n\"The Story of Kullervo\", first published in \"Tolkien Studies\" in 2010 and reissued with additional material in 2015, is a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem. It was written in 1915 while Tolkien was studying at Oxford.\n\n\"The Tale of Beren and Lúthien\" is one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien's legendarium. The story is one of three contained within \"The Silmarillion\" which Tolkien believed to warrant their own long-form narratives. It was published as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien, under the title \"Beren and Lúthien\" in 2017.\n\n\"The Fall of Gondolin\" is a tale of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces, which Tolkien called \"the first real story\" of Middle-earth, was published on 30 August 2018 as a standalone book, edited by Christopher Tolkien and illustrated by Alan Lee.\n\nBefore his death, Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works—including \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\"—to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien's \"Silmarillion\" mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. The Library held an exhibition of his work in 2018, including more than 60 items which had never been seen in public before.\n\nIn 2009, a partial draft of \"Language and Human Nature\", which Tolkien had begun co-writing with C. S. Lewis but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.\n\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject. He worked on the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including \"walrus\", over which he struggled mightily. In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\". He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.\n\nPrivately, Tolkien was attracted to \"things of racial and linguistic significance\", and in his 1955 lecture \"English and Welsh\", which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which he termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak. He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own \"native language\", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, \"I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).\"\n\nParallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages. The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's \"legendarium\". Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of esthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elvenlatin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek. A notable addition came in late 1945 with Adûnaic or Númenórean, a language of a \"faintly Semitic flavour\", connected with Tolkien's Atlantis legend, which by \"The Notion Club Papers\" ties directly into his ideas about the inability of language to be inherited, and via the \"Second Age\" and the story of Eärendil was grounded in the \"legendarium\", thereby providing a link of Tolkien's 20th-century \"real primary world\" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture \"A Secret Vice\", \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"Volapük, Esperanto, Ido, Novial, &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings \"dwarves\" and \"dwarvish\" (alongside \"dwarfs\" and \"dwarfish\"), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been \"dwarrows\" or \"dwerrows\".) He also coined the term \"eucatastrophe\", though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.\n\nTolkien was an accomplished artist, who learned to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his life. From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in \"Mr Bliss\" and \"Roverandom\", and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of \"The Hobbit\". Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: \"\". The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work.\n\nIn a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895–1976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\". The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\" and \"Farmer Giles of Ham\") and Donald Swann (who set the music to \"The Road Goes Ever On\"). Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to \"The Lord of the Rings\" in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.\n\nHowever, Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving. In 1946, he rejected suggestions for illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of \"The Hobbit\" as \"too Disnified ... Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of\".\n\nTolkien was sceptical of the emerging Tolkien fandom in the United States, and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of \"The Lord of the Rings\":\nHe had dismissed dramatic representations of fantasy in his essay \"On Fairy-Stories\", first presented in 1939:\nTolkien scholar James Dunning coined the word \"Tollywood\", a portmanteau derived from \"Tolkien Hollywood\", to describe attempts to create a cinematographic adaptation of the stories in Tolkien's legendarium aimed at generating good box office results, rather than at fidelity to the idea of the original.\n\nOn receiving a screenplay for a proposed film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" by Morton Grady Zimmerman, Tolkien wrote:\nTolkien went on to criticize the script scene by scene (\"yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings\"). He was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" to United Artists in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\" was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of \"The Lord of the Rings\". In 1977, an animated musical television film of \"The Hobbit\" was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film \"The Return of the King\", which covered some of the portions of \"The Lord of the Rings\" that Bakshi was unable to complete.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, New Line Cinema released \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by Peter Jackson. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous Oscars.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema released \"The Hobbit\", a series of three films based on \"The Hobbit\", with Peter Jackson serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer. The first instalment, \"\", was released in December 2012; the second, \"\", in December 2013; and the last instalment, \"\", in December 2014.\n\nA biographical film \"Tolkien\" was released on 10 May 2019. It focused on Tolkien's early life and war experiences. The Tolkien family and estate have stated that they did not \"approve of, authorise or participate in the making of\" the film.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, it was announced that Amazon had acquired the global television rights to \"The Lord of the Rings\". The series will not be a direct adaptation of the books, but will instead introduce new stories that are set before \"The Fellowship of the Ring.\" The press release referred to \"previously unexplored stories based on J. R. R. Tolkien's original writings\". Amazon will be the producer in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and The Tolkien Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema.\n\nTolkien and the characters and places from his works have become eponyms of various things around the world. These include street names, mountains, companies, and species of animals and plants as well as other notable objects.\n\nBy convention, certain classes of features on Saturn's moon Titan are named after elements from Middle-earth. \"Colles\" (small hills or knobs) are named for characters, while \"montes\" (mountains) are named for mountains of Middle-earth. There are also asteroids named for Bilbo Baggins and Tolkien himself.\n\nThree mountains in the Cadwallader Range of British Columbia, Canada, have been named after Tolkien's characters. These are Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn. Nearby Tolkien Peak is named for him. On 1 December 2012, it was announced in the New Zealand press that a bid was launched for the New Zealand Geographic Board to name a mountain peak near Milford Sound after Tolkien for historical and literary reasons and to mark Tolkien's 121st birthday.\n\nThe \"Tolkien Road\" in Eastbourne, East Sussex, was named after Tolkien whereas the \"Tolkien Way\" in Stoke-on-Trent is named after Tolkien's eldest son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains. In the Hall Green and Moseley areas of Birmingham there are a number of parks and walkways dedicated to J. R. R. Tolkien—most notably, the Millstream Way and Moseley Bog. Collectively the parks are known as the Shire Country Parks. Also in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England there are a collection of roads in the 'Weston Village' named after locales of Middle Earth, namely Hobbiton Road, Bree Close, Arnor Close, Rivendell, Westmarch Way and Buckland Green.\n\nIn the Dutch town of Geldrop, near Eindhoven, the streets of an entire new neighbourhood are named after Tolkien himself (\"Laan van Tolkien\") and some of the best-known characters from his books.\n\nIn the Silicon Valley towns of Saratoga and San Jose in California, there are two housing developments with street names drawn from Tolkien's works. About a dozen Tolkien-derived street names also appear scattered throughout the town of Lake Forest, California. The Columbia, Maryland, neighbourhood of Hobbit's Glen and its street names (including Rivendell Lane, Tooks Way, and Oakenshield Circle) come from Tolkien's works.\n\nIn the field of taxonomy, over 80 taxa (genera and species) have been given scientific names honouring, or deriving from, characters or other fictional elements from \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"The Hobbit\", and other works set in Middle-earth.\nSeveral taxa have been named after the character Gollum (also known as Sméagol), as well as for various hobbits, the small humanlike creatures such as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. Various elves, dwarves, and other creatures that appear in his writings, as well as Tolkien himself, have been honoured in the names of several species, including the amphipod \"Leucothoe tolkieni\", and the wasp \"Shireplitis tolkieni\". In 2004, the extinct hominid \"Homo floresiensis\" was described, and quickly earned the nickname \"hobbit\" due to its small size. In 1978, paleontologist Leigh Van Valen named over 20 taxa of extinct mammals after Tolkien lore in a single paper. In 1999, entomologist Lauri Kaila described 48 new species of \"Elachista\" moths and named 37 of them after Tolkien mythology. It has been noted that \"Tolkien has been accorded formal taxonomic commemoration like no other author.\"\n\nSince 2003, The Tolkien Society has organized Tolkien Reading Day, which takes place on 25 March in schools around the world.\n\nIn 2013, Pembroke College, Oxford University established an annual lecture on fantasy literature in Tolkien's honour.\n\nThere are seven blue plaques in England that commemorate places associated with Tolkien: one in Oxford, one in Bournemouth, four in Birmingham and one in Leeds. One of the Birmingham plaques commemorates the inspiration provided by Sarehole Mill, near which he lived between the ages of four and eight, while two mark childhood homes up to the time he left to attend Oxford University and the other marks a hotel he stayed at before leaving for France during World War I. The plaque in West Park, Leeds, commemorates the five years Tolkien enjoyed at Leeds as Reader and then Professor of English Language at the University. The Oxford plaque commemorates the residence where Tolkien wrote \"The Hobbit\" and most of \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\n! Address !! Commemoration !! Date unveiled !! Issued by\n\nAnother two plaques marking buildings associated with Tolkien are:-\nBULLET::::- On a residence in Harrogate where Tolkien convalesced from trench fever in 1917.\nBULLET::::- On 76 Sandfield Road, Headington, Oxford, his home from 1953 to 1968.\n\nIn 2012, Tolkien was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\n\nUnlike other authors of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his individual writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may occur on the market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of \"The Hobbit\" from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, the Oxford Oratory, Tolkien's parish church during his time in Oxford, offered its first Mass for the intention of Tolkien's cause for beatification to be opened.\n\nA prayer was written for his cause:\n\nBULLET::::- J.

{"id": "15879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15879", "title": "James Branch Cabell", "text": "James Branch Cabell\n\nJames Branch Cabell (; April 14, 1879  – May 5, 1958) was an American author of fantasy fiction and \"belles-lettres\". Cabell was well-regarded by his contemporaries, including H. L. Mencken, Edmund Wilson, and Sinclair Lewis. His works were considered escapist and fit well in the culture of the 1920s, when they were most popular. For Cabell, veracity was \"the one unpardonable sin, not merely against art, but against human welfare.\"\n\nAlthough escapist, Cabell's works are ironic and satirical. H. L. Mencken disputed Cabell's claim to romanticism and characterized him as \"really the most acidulous of all the anti-romantics. His gaudy heroes ... chase dragons precisely as stockbrockers play golf.\" Cabell saw art as an escape from life, but once the artist creates his ideal world, he finds that it is made up of the same elements that make the real one.\n\nInterest in Cabell declined in the 1930s, a decline that has been attributed in part to his failure to move out of his fantasy niche despite the onset of World War II. Alfred Kazin said that \"Cabell and Hitler did not inhabit the same universe\".\n\nCabell was born into an affluent and well-connected Virginian family, and lived most of his life in Richmond. The first Cabell settled in Virginia in 1664; Cabell's paternal great-grandfather, William H. Cabell, was Governor of the Commonwealth from 1805 to 1808. Cabell County in West Virginia is named after the Governor. James Branch Cabell's grandfather, Robert Gamble Cabell, was a physician; his father, Robert Gamble Cabell II (1847–1922), had an MD, but practiced as a druggist; his mother, Anne Harris (1859–1915), was the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel James R. Branch, of the Army of the Confederate States of America. James was the oldest of three boys—his brothers were Robert Gamble Cabell III (1881–1968) and John Lottier Cabell (1883–1946). His parents separated and were later divorced in 1907. His aunt was the suffragist and educationist Mary-Cooke Branch Munford.\n\nAlthough Cabell's surname is often mispronounced \"Ka-BELL\", he himself pronounced it \"CAB-ble.\" To remind an editor of the correct pronunciation, Cabell composed this rhyme: \"Tell the rabble my name is Cabell.\"\n\nCabell matriculated at the College of William and Mary in 1894 at the age of fifteen and graduated in June 1898. While an undergraduate, Cabell taught French and Greek at the College. According to his close friend and fellow author Ellen Glasgow, Cabell developed a friendship with a professor at the college which was considered by some to be \"too intimate\" and, as a result Cabell was dismissed, although he was subsequently readmitted and finished his degree. Following his graduation, he worked from 1898 to 1900 as a newspaper reporter in New York City, but returned to Richmond in 1901, where he worked several months on the staff of the \"Richmond News\".\n\n1901 was an eventful year for Cabell: his first stories were accepted for publication, and he was suspected of the murder of John Scott, a wealthy Richmonder. It was rumored that Scott was involved romantically with Cabell's mother. Cabell's supposed involvement in the Scott murder and his college \"scandal\" were both mentioned in Ellen Glasgow's posthumously published (1954) autobiography \"The Woman Within\". In 1902, seven of Cabell's first stories appeared in national magazines and over the next decade he wrote many short stories and articles, contributing to nationally published magazines including \"Harper's Monthly Magazine\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\", as well as carrying out extensive research on his family's genealogy.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1913, he was employed by his uncle in the office of the Branch coal mines in West Virginia. On November 8, 1913, he married Priscilla Bradley Shepherd, a widow with five children from her previous marriage. In 1915, son Ballard Hartwell Cabell was born. Priscilla died in March 1949; Cabell was remarried in June 1950 to Margaret Waller Freeman.\n\nDuring his life, Cabell published fifty-two books, including novels, genealogies, collections of short stories, poetry, and miscellanea. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937.\n\nCabell died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1958 in Richmond, and was buried in the graveyard of the Emmanuel Church at Brook Hill. The following year the remains of Cabell and his first wife were reinterred in Hollywood Cemetery.\n\nSignificant Cabell collections are housed at various repositories, including Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Virginia.\n\nIn 1970, Virginia Commonwealth University, also located in Richmond, named its main campus library \"James Branch Cabell Library\" in his honor. In the 1970s, Cabell's personal library and personal papers were moved from his home on Monument Avenue to the James Branch Cabell Library. Consisting of some 3,000 volumes, the collection includes manuscripts; notebooks and scrapbooks; periodicals in which Cabell's essays, reviews and fiction were published; his correspondence with noted writers including H. L. Mencken, Ellen Glasgow, Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser; correspondence with family, friends, editors and publishers, newspaper clippings, photographs, periodicals, criticisms, printed material; publishers' agreements; and statements of sales. The collection resides in the Special Collections and Archives department of the library. \nThe VCU undergraduate literary journal at the university is named \"Poictesme\" after the fictional province in his cycle \"Biography of the Life of Manuel\".\n\nMore recently, VCU spent over $50 million to expand and modernize the James Branch Cabell Library to further entrench it as the premier library in the Greater Richmond Area and one of the top landmark libraries in the United States. In 2016 Cabell Library won the New Landmark Library Award.\nThe Library Journal's website provides a virtual walking tour of the new James Branch Cabell Library.\n\nCabell's best-known book, \"Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice\" (1919), was the subject of a celebrated obscenity case shortly after its publication. The eponymous hero, who considers himself a \"monstrous clever fellow,\" embarks on a journey through ever more fantastic realms, even to hell and heaven. Everywhere he goes, he winds up seducing the local women, even the Devil's wife.\n\nThe novel was denounced by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice; they attempted to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publisher, Robert M. McBride, won: the \"indecencies\" were double entendres that also had a perfectly decent interpretation, though it appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal infallibility. The presiding judge, Charles Cooper Nott, Jr., wrote in his decision that \"... the most that can be said against the book is that certain passages therein may be considered suggestive in a veiled and subtle way of immorality, but such suggestions are delicately conveyed\" and that because of Cabell's writing style \"... it is doubtful if the book could be read or understood at all by more than a very limited number of readers.\"\n\nCabell took an author's revenge: the revised edition of 1926 included a previously \"lost\" passage in which the hero is placed on trial by the Philistines, with a large dung-beetle as the chief prosecutor. He also wrote a short book, \"Taboo\", in which he thanks John H. Sumner and the Society for Suppression of Vice for generating the publicity that gave his career a boost. Due to the notoriety of the suppression of \"Jurgen\", Cabell became a figure of international fame. In the early 1920s, he became associated by some critics with a group of writers referred to as, \"The James Branch Cabell School,\" which included such figures as H. L. Mencken, Carl Van Vechten and Elinor Wylie.\n\nA great deal of Cabell's work has focused on \"The Biography of the Life of Manuel\", the story of a character named Dom Manuel and his descendants through many generations. The biography includes a total of 25 works that were written over a 23-year period. Cabell stated that he considered the \"Biography\" to be a single work, and supervised its publication in a single uniform edition of 18 volumes, known as the \"Storisende Edition\", published from 1927 to 1930. A number of the volumes of the Biography were also published in editions illustrated by Frank C. Papé between 1921 and 1926.\n\nThe themes and characters from \"Jurgen\" make appearances in many works included in the Biography. \"Figures of Earth\" tells the story of Manuel the swineherd, a morally ambiguous protagonist who rises to conquer a realm by playing on others' expectations—his motto being Mundus Vult Decipi, meaning \"the world wishes to be deceived.\" \"The Silver Stallion\" is a loose sequel to \"Figures of Earth\" that deals with the creation of the legend of Manuel the Redeemer, in which Manuel is pictured as an infallible hero, an example to which all others should aspire; the story is told by Manuel's former knights, who remember how things really were and take different approaches to reconciling the mythology with the actuality of Manuel.\n\nMany of these books take place in the fictional country eventually ruled by Manuel, known as \"Poictesme\", (pronounced \"pwa-tem\"). It was the author's intention to situate Poictesme roughly in the south of France. The name suggests the two real French cities of Poitiers (medieval Poictiers) and Angoulême (medieval Angoulesme). Several other books take place in the fictional town of Lichfield, Virginia.\n\nAfter concluding the \"Biography\" in 1932, Cabell shortened his professional name to \"Branch Cabell\". The truncated name was used for all his new, \"post-\"Biography\"\" publications until the printing of \"There Were Two Pirates\" (1946).\n\nThough Cabell is best known as a fantasist, the plots and characters of his first few novels, \"The Eagle's Shadow\" (1904), \"The Cords of Vanity\" (1909), and \"The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck\" (1915) (later all adapted for inclusion into the \"Biography\"), do not wander out of the everyday society of Virginia's beleaguered gentry. But Cabell's signature droll style is clearly in evidence, and in later printings each book would bear a characteristically Cabellian subtitle: \"A Comedy of Purse-Strings\", \"A Comedy of Shirking\", and \"A Comedy of Limitations\", respectively.\n\nHis later novel, \"The First Gentleman of America: A Comedy of Conquest\" (1942), retells the strange career of an American Indian from the shores of the Potomac who sailed away with Spanish explorers, later to return, be made chief of his tribe, and kill all the Spaniards in the new Virginia settlement. Cabell delivered a more concise, historical treatment of the novel's events in \"The First Virginian\", part one of his 1947 work of non-fiction, \"Let Me Lie\", a book on the history of Virginia.\n\nOther works include:\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Nightmare Has Triplets\" trilogy, comprising \"Smirt\" (1934), \"Smith\" (1935), and \"Smire\" (1937)\nBULLET::::- The \"Heirs and Assigns\" trilogy, comprising \"Hamlet Had an Uncle\" (1940), \"The King Was in His Counting House\" (1938), and \"The First Gentleman of America\" (1942)\nBULLET::::- The \"It Happened in Florida\" trilogy, comprising \"The St. Johns\" (written in collaboration with A.

L. Mencken, Joseph Hergesheimer, and Jack Woodford. Although now largely forgotten by the general public, his work was remarkably influential on later authors of fantasy fiction. James Blish was a fan of Cabell's works, and for a time edited \"Kalki,\" the journal of the Cabell Society. Robert A. Heinlein was greatly inspired by Cabell's boldness, and originally described his book \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" as \"a Cabellesque satire.\" A later work, \"\" derived its title from \"Jurgen\" and contains appearances by Jurgen and the Slavic god Koschei.\nFritz Leiber's \"Swords of Lankhmar\" was influenced by \"Jurgen\". Charles G. Finney's fantasy \"The Circus of Dr. Lao\" was influenced by Cabell's work. The Averoigne stories of Clark Ashton Smith are, in background, close to those of Cabell's Poictesme. Jack Vance's Dying Earth books show considerable stylistic resemblances to Cabell; Cugel the Clever in those books bears a strong resemblance, not least in his opinion of himself, to Jurgen. Cabell was also a major influence on Neil Gaiman, acknowledged as such in the rear of Gaiman's novels \"Stardust\" and \"American Gods\". This thematic and stylistic influence is highly evident in the multi-layered pantheons of Gaiman's work, \"The Sandman\", which have many parallels in Cabell's work, particularly \"Jurgen\".\n\nCabell maintained a close and lifelong friendship with well-known Richmond writer Ellen Glasgow, whose house on West Main Street was only a few blocks from Cabell's family home on East Franklin Street. They corresponded extensively between 1923 and Glasgow's death in 1945 and over 200 of their letters survive. Cabell dedicated his 1927 novel \"Something About Eve\" to her, and she in turn dedicated her book \"They Stooped to Folly: A Comedy of Morals\" (1929) to Cabell. In her autobiography, Glasgow also gave considerable thanks to Cabell for his help in the editing of her Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"In This Our Life\" (1941). However, late in their lives, friction developed between the two writers as a result of Cabell's critical 1943 review of Glasgow's novel \"A Certain Measure\".\n\nCabell also admired the work of the Atlanta-based writer Frances Newman, though their correspondence was cut short by her premature death in 1928. In 1929, Cabell supplied the preface to Newman's collected letters.\n\nFrom 1969 through 1972, the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series returned six of Cabell's novels to print, and elevated his profile in the fantasy genre. Today, many more of his works are available from Wildside Press.\n\nCabell's three-character one-act play \"The Jewel Merchants\" was used for the libretto of an opera by Louis Cheslock which premiered in 1940.\n\nMichael Swanwick published a critical monograph on Cabell's work, which argues for the continued value of a few of Cabell's works—notably \"Jurgen\", \"The Cream of the Jest\", and \"The Silver Stallion\"—while acknowledging that some of his writing has dated badly. Swanwick places much of the blame for Cabell's obscurity on Cabell himself, for authorizing the 18-volume Storisende uniform edition of the \"Biography of the Life of Manuel\", including much that was of poor quality and ephemeral. This alienated admirers and scared off potential new readers. \"There are, alas, an infinite number of ways for a writer to destroy himself,\" Swanwick wrote. \"James Branch Cabell chose one of the more interesting. Standing at the helm of the single most successful literary career of any fantasist of the twentieth century, he drove the great ship of his career straight and unerringly onto the rocks.\"\n\nOther book-length studies on Cabell were written during the period of his fame by Hugh Walpole, W. A. McNeill, and Carl van Doren. Edmund Wilson tried to rehabilitate his reputation with a long essay in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nBULLET::::- Lin Carter \"The World's Edge, and Beyond: The Fiction of Dunsany, Eddison and Cabell\" in \"Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy\".

{"id": "15881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15881", "title": "Java (programming language)", "text": "Java (programming language)\n\nJava is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. , Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, \nparticularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.\n\nJava was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\n\nThe latest versions are Java 13, released in September 2019, and Java 11, a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release.\n\nJames Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called \"Oak\" after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name \"Green\" and was finally renamed \"Java\", from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.\n\nSun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as \"Java EE\", \"Java ME\", and \"Java SE\", respectively.\n\nIn 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a \"de facto\" standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.\n\nSun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an \"evangelist\". Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency. This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the \"Android\" section). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.\n\nIn January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.\n\nThere were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:\nBULLET::::1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.\nBULLET::::2. It must be robust and secure.\nBULLET::::3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.\nBULLET::::4. It must execute with high performance.\nBULLET::::5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.\n, Java 8 is supported; and both Java 8 and 11 as Long Term Support (LTS) versions. Major release versions of Java, along with their release dates:\n\nBULLET::::- JDK 1.0 (January 23, 1996)\nBULLET::::- JDK 1.1 (February 19, 1996)\nBULLET::::- J2SE 1.2 (December 8, 1998)\nBULLET::::- J2SE 1.3 (May 8, 2000)\nBULLET::::- J2SE 1.4 (February 6, 2002)\nBULLET::::- J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 6 (December 11, 2006)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 7 (July 28, 2011)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 8 (March 18, 2014)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 9 (September 21, 2017)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 10 (March 20, 2018)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 11 (September 25, 2018)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 12 (March 19, 2019)\nBULLET::::- Java SE 13 (September 17, 2019)\n\nSun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:\n\nBULLET::::- Java Card for smart-cards.\nBULLET::::- Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) – targeting environments with limited resources.\nBULLET::::- Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) – targeting workstation environments.\nBULLET::::- Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.\n\nThe classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes, and exceptions. Refer to the separate platforms for a description of the packages available. \n\nSun also provided an edition called Personal Java that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.\n\nOne design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support.\nThis is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.\n\nStandard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.\n\nThe use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.\n\nPrograms written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++. However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including lock free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.\n\nSome platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine, and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.\n\nJava uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown.\n\nOne of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case, the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent logical memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.\n\nGarbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.\n\nJava does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.\n\nAs in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.\n\nJava contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the parallel scavenge garbage collector. However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For 90% of applications in Java, the Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) garbage collector is sufficient. Oracle aims to replace CMS with the Garbage-First Collector (G1).\n\nHaving solved the memory management problem does not relieve the programmer of the burden of handling properly other kind of resources, like network or database connections, file handles, etc., especially in the presence of exceptions. \n\nThe syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside classes, and every data item is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types, (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not objects for performance reasons. Java reuses some popular aspects of C++ (such as the method).\n\nUnlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for classes, though multiple inheritance is supported for interfaces.\n\nJava uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (codice_1), a multiple line style opened with codice_2 and closed with codice_3, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with codice_4 and closed with codice_3. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create documentation for the program and can be read by some integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.\n\nThe traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:\n\nSource files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix codice_6, for example, codice_7. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file named codice_8. Only then can it be executed, or launched. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with a non-public access modifier and any number of public inner classes. When the source file contains multiple classes, it is necessary to make one class (introduced by the codice_9 keyword) public (preceded by the codice_10 keyword) and name the source file with that public class name.\n\nA class that is not declared public may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with \".class\" appended. For class file generation, anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a \"$\", and an integer.\n\nThe keyword codice_10 denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located. This is called an access level modifier. Other access level modifiers include the keywords codice_12 and codice_13.\n\nThe keyword codice_14 in front of a method indicates a static method, which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static. Methods that are not designated static are instance methods and require a specific instance of a class to operate.\n\nThe keyword codice_15 indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.\n\nThe method name codice_16 is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and Enterprise JavaBeans do not use or need a codice_17 method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have codice_16 methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.\n\nThe main method must accept an array of objects. By convention, it is referenced as codice_19 although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use variable arguments, in the form of codice_20, allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of codice_21 arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (to the codice_19 parameter which is still an array of codice_21 objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.\n\nThe Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a JAR) and starting its codice_24 method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The codice_25 parameter is an array of objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to codice_16 are often passed by means of a command line.\n\nPrinting is part of a Java standard library: The ' class defines a public static field called '. The codice_27 object is an instance of the class and provides many methods for printing data to standard out, including which also appends a new line to the passed string.\n\nThe string codice_28 is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.\n\nJava applets were programs that were embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser. The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 8 in 2017.\n\nJava servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses (typically HTML pages) to requests (typically HTTP requests) from clients.\n\nThe Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services:\n\nBULLET::::- the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and\nBULLET::::- the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services.\n\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters codice_29 and codice_30. A JSP is compiled to a Java \"servlet\", a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.\n\nSwing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.\n\nJavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich Internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but both will be included for the foreseeable future. JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.\n\nIn 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually codice_31, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors (codice_32's) from occurring, it would be type safe.\n\nIn 2016, the type system of Java was proven unsound.\n\nCriticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics, speed, the handling of unsigned numbers, the implementation of floating-point arithmetic, and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.\n\nThe Java Class Library is the standard library, developed to support application development in Java. It is controlled by Sun Microsystems in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy during the 2010s. The class library contains features such as:\n\nBULLET::::- The core libraries, which include:\nBULLET::::- IO/NIO\nBULLET::::- Networking\nBULLET::::- Reflection\nBULLET::::- Concurrency\nBULLET::::- Generics\nBULLET::::- Scripting/Compiler\nBULLET::::- Functional programming (Lambda, Streaming)\nBULLET::::- Collection libraries that implement data structures such as lists, dictionaries, trees, sets, queues and double-ended queue, or stacks\nBULLET::::- XML Processing (Parsing, Transforming, Validating) libraries\nBULLET::::- Security\nBULLET::::- Internationalization and localization libraries\nBULLET::::- The integration libraries, which allow the application writer to communicate with external systems. These libraries include:\nBULLET::::- The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for database access\nBULLET::::- Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) for lookup and discovery\nBULLET::::- RMI and CORBA for distributed application development\nBULLET::::- JMX for managing and monitoring applications\nBULLET::::- User interface libraries, which include:\nBULLET::::- The (heavyweight, or native) Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), which provides GUI components, the means for laying out those components and the means for handling events from those components\nBULLET::::- The (lightweight) Swing libraries, which are built on AWT but provide (non-native) implementations of the AWT widgetry\nBULLET::::- APIs for audio capture, processing, and playback\nBULLET::::- JavaFX\nBULLET::::- A platform dependent implementation of the Java virtual machine that is the means by which the bytecodes of the Java libraries and third party applications are executed\nBULLET::::- Plugins, which enable applets to be run in web browsers\nBULLET::::- Java Web Start, which allows Java applications to be efficiently distributed to end users across the Internet\nBULLET::::- Licensing and documentation\n\nJavadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems, used by many Java developers. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are codice_4 and codice_3, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the delimiters codice_2 and codice_3.\n\nOracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.\n\nThe Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger. Oracle has also released GraalVM, a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter.\n\nOpenJDK is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.\n\nThe goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be \"compatible\". This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI or JNI and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun. As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows.\n\nPlatform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.\n\nThe Java programming language requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed.\n\nOracle supplies the Java platform for use with Java. The Android SDK is an alternative software platform, used primarily for developing Android applications with its own GUI system.\n\nThe Java language is a key pillar in Android, an open source mobile operating system. Although Android, built on the Linux kernel, is written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications but does not use any of its standard GUI, SE, ME or other established Java standards. The bytecode language supported by the Android SDK is incompatible with Java bytecode and runs on its own virtual machine, optimized for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Depending on the Android version, the bytecode is either interpreted by the Dalvik virtual machine or compiled into native code by the Android Runtime.\n\nAndroid does not provide the full Java SE standard library, although the Android SDK does include an independent implementation of a large subset of it. It supports Java 6 and some Java 7 features, offering an implementation compatible with the standard library (Apache Harmony).\n\nThe use of Java-related technology in Android led to a legal dispute between Oracle and Google. On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices. District Judge William Haskell Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted, but this was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2014. On May 26, 2016, the district court decided in favor of Google, ruling the copyright infringement of the Java API in Android constitutes fair use. On March 2018, this ruling was overturned by the Appeals Court, which sent down the case of determining the damages to federal court in San Francisco.\nGoogle filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in January 2019 to challenge the two rulings that were made by the Appeals Court towards Oracle's favor.\n\nBULLET::::- C#\nBULLET::::- C++\nBULLET::::- Dalvik, used in old Android versions, replaced by non-JIT Android Runtime\nBULLET::::- Deterministic Parallel Java\nBULLET::::- List of Java virtual machines\nBULLET::::- List of Java APIs\nBULLET::::- List of JVM languages\n\nBULLET::::- Comparison of C# and Java\nBULLET::::- Comparison of Java and C++\n\n"}

{"id": "15885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15885", "title": "Jason", "text": "Jason\n\nJason ( ; , ) was an ancient Greek mythological hero and leader of the Argonauts, whose quest for the Golden Fleece featured in Greek literature. He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of Iolcos. He was married to the sorceress Medea. He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side.\n\nJason appeared in various literary works in the classical world of Greece and Rome, including the epic poem \"Argonautica\" and the tragedy \"Medea\". In the modern world, Jason has emerged as a character in various adaptations of his myths, such as the 1963 film \"Jason and the Argonauts\" and the 2000 TV miniseries of the same name.\n\nJason's father is invariably Aeson, but there is great variation as to his mother's name. According to various authors, she could be:\nBULLET::::- Alcimede, daughter of Phylacus\nBULLET::::- Polymede, or Polymele, or Polypheme, a daughter of Autolycus\nBULLET::::- Amphinome\nBULLET::::- Theognete, daughter of Laodicus\nBULLET::::- Rhoeo\nBULLET::::- Arne or Scarphe\n\nJason was also said to have had a younger brother Promachus.\n\nBy Medea:\nBULLET::::- Alcimenes, murdered by Medea.\nBULLET::::- Thessalus, twin of Alcimenes and king of Iolcus.\nBULLET::::- Tisander, murdered by Medea\nBULLET::::- Mermeros killed either by the Corinthians or by Medea\nBULLET::::- Pheres, as above\nBULLET::::- Eriopis, their only daughter\nBULLET::::- Medus or Polyxemus, otherwise son of Aegeus\nBULLET::::- Argus\nBULLET::::- seven sons and seven daughters\n\nBy Hypsipyle:\nBULLET::::- Euneus, King of Lemnos and his twin\nBULLET::::- Nebrophonus or\nBULLET::::- Deipylus or\nBULLET::::- Thoas\n\n+Comparative table of Jason's family\n! rowspan=\"2\" Relation\n! rowspan=\"2\" Name\n! colspan=\"13\" Source\n\n\"(Sch. on) Homer\"\n\"(Sch. on) Apollonius\"\n\"Diodorus\"\n\"Valerius\"\n\"Ptolemy\"\n\"Pausanias\"\n\"Tzetzes\"\n\"Smith\"\nAeson and Polymele or\n\nAeson and Polypheme or\n\nAeson and Polymede\n\nAeson and Alcimede\n\nAeson and Theognete\n\nAeson and Amphinome\n✓\n\nAeson and Rhoe\n\nAeson and Arne\n\nAeson and Scarphe\n\n\"Sibling\"\nPromachus\n✓\n\nMedea\n✓\n\n✓\n\n✓\nHypsipyle\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nMermeros\n✓\n\nPheres\n✓\n\nAlcimenes\n\nThessalus\n\nTisandrus\n\n7 sons & 7 daughters\n\nEriopis\n\n✓\n\nMedus or Polyxemus\n\n✓\n\nArgus\n\n✓\nEuneus\n\n✓\n\n✓\n\nNebrophonus\n\n✓\n\nDeipylus\n\n✓\n\nThoas\n\nPelias (Aeson's half-brother) was power-hungry and sought to gain dominion over all of Thessaly. Pelias was the progeny of a union between their shared mother, Tyro (\"high born Tyro\"), the daughter of Salmoneus, and the sea god Poseidon. In a bitter feud, he overthrew Aeson (the rightful king), killing all the descendants of Aeson that he could. He spared his half-brother for unknown reasons. Aeson's wife Alcimede I had a newborn son named Jason whom she saved from Pelias by having female attendants cluster around the infant and cry as if he were still-born. Fearing that Pelias would eventually notice and kill her son, Alcimede sent him away to be reared by the centaur Chiron,; she claimed that she had been having an affair with him all along. Pelias, fearing that his ill-gotten kingship might be challenged, consulted an oracle, who warned him to beware of a man wearing only one sandal.\n\nMany years later, Pelias was holding games in honor of Poseidon when the grown Jason arrived in Iolcus, having lost one of his sandals in the river Anauros (\"wintry Anauros\") while helping an old woman (actually the Goddess Hera in disguise) to cross. She blessed him for she knew, as goddesses do, what Pelias had planned. When Jason entered Iolcus (present-day city of Volos), he was announced as a man wearing only one sandal. Jason, aware that he was the rightful king, so informed Pelias. Pelias replied, \"To take my throne, which you shall, you must go on a quest to find the Golden Fleece.\" Jason readily accepted this condition.\n\nJason assembled for his crew, a number of heroes, known as the Argonauts after their ship, the \"Argo\". The group of heroes included the Boreads (sons of Boreas, the North Wind) who could fly, Heracles, Philoctetes, Peleus, Telamon, Orpheus, Castor and Pollux, Atalanta, Meleager and Euphemus.\n\nThe isle of Lemnos is situated off the Western coast of Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). The island was inhabited by a race of women who had killed their husbands. The women had neglected their worship of Aphrodite, and as a punishment the goddess made the women so foul in stench that their husbands could not bear to be near them. The men then took concubines from the Thracian mainland opposite, and the spurned women, angry at Aphrodite, killed all the male inhabitants while they slept. The king, Thoas, was saved by Hypsipyle, his daughter, who put him out to sea sealed in a chest from which he was later rescued. The women of Lemnos lived for a while without men, with Hypsipyle as their queen.\nDuring the visit of the Argonauts the women mingled with the men creating a new \"race\" called Minyae. Jason fathered twins with the queen. Heracles pressured them to leave as he was disgusted by the antics of the Argonauts. He had not taken part, which is truly unusual considering the numerous affairs he had with other women. \n\nAfter Lemnos the Argonauts landed among the Doliones, whose king Cyzicus treated them graciously. He told them about the land beyond Bear Mountain, but forgot to mention what lived there. What lived in the land beyond Bear Mountain were the Gegeines, which are a tribe of Earthborn giants with six arms and wore leather loincloths. While most of the crew went into the forest to search for supplies, the Gegeines saw that few Argonauts were guarding the ship and raided it. Heracles was among those guarding the ship at the time and managed to kill most them before Jason and the others returned. Once some of the other Gegeines were killed, Jason and the Argonauts set sail.\n\nThe Argonauts departed, losing their bearings and landing again at the same spot that night. In the darkness, the Doliones took them for enemies and they started fighting each other. The Argonauts killed many of the Doliones, among them the king Cyzicus. Cyzicus' wife killed herself. The Argonauts realized their horrible mistake when dawn came and held a funeral for him.\n\nSoon Jason reached the court of Phineus of Salmydessus in Thrace. Zeus had sent the harpies to steal the food put out for Phineas each day. Jason took pity on the emaciated king and killed the Harpies when they returned; in other versions, Calais and Zetes chase the harpies away. In return for this favor, Phineas revealed to Jason the location of Colchis and how to pass the Symplegades, or The Clashing Rocks, and then they parted.\n\nThe only way to reach Colchis was to sail through the Symplegades (Clashing Rocks), huge rock cliffs that came together and crushed anything that traveled between them. Phineas told Jason to release a dove when they approached these islands, and if the dove made it through, to row with all their might. If the dove was crushed, he was doomed to fail. Jason released the dove as advised, which made it through, losing only a few tail feathers. Seeing this, they rowed strongly and made it through with minor damage at the extreme stern of the ship. From that time on, the clashing rocks were forever joined leaving free passage for others to pass.\n\nJason arrived in Colchis (modern Black Sea coast of Georgia) to claim the fleece as his own. It was owned by King Aeetes of Colchis. The fleece was given to him by Phrixus. Aeetes promised to give it to Jason only if he could perform three certain tasks. Presented with the tasks, Jason became discouraged and fell into depression. However, Hera had persuaded Aphrodite to convince her son Eros to make Aeetes' daughter, Medea, fall in love with Jason. As a result, Medea aided Jason in his tasks. First, Jason had to plow a field with fire-breathing oxen, the Khalkotauroi, that he had to yoke himself. Medea provided an ointment that protected him from the oxen's flames. Then, Jason sowed the teeth of a dragon into a field. The teeth sprouted into an army of warriors (spartoi). Medea had previously warned Jason of this and told him how to defeat this foe. Before they attacked him, he threw a rock into the crowd. Unable to discover where the rock had come from, the soldiers attacked and defeated one another. His last task was to overcome the sleepless dragon which guarded the Golden Fleece. Jason sprayed the dragon with a potion, given by Medea, distilled from herbs. The dragon fell asleep, and Jason was able to seize the Golden Fleece. He then sailed away with Medea. Medea distracted her father, who chased them as they fled, by killing her brother Apsyrtus and throwing pieces of his body into the sea; Aeetes stopped to gather them. In another version, Medea lured Apsyrtus into a trap. Jason killed him, chopped off his fingers and toes, and buried the corpse. In any case, Jason and Medea escaped.\n\nOn the way back to Iolcus, Medea prophesied to Euphemus, the Argo's helmsman, that one day he would rule Cyrene. This came true through Battus, a descendant of Euphemus. Zeus, as punishment for the slaughter of Medea's own brother, sent a series of storms at the \"Argo\" and blew it off course. The \"Argo\" then spoke and said that they should seek purification with Circe, a nymph living on the island of Aeaea. After being cleansed, they continued their journey home.\n\nChiron had told Jason that without the aid of Orpheus, the Argonauts would never be able to pass the Sirens—the same Sirens encountered by Odysseus in Homer's epic poem the \"Odyssey\". The Sirens lived on three small, rocky islands called Sirenum scopuli and sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors to come to them, which resulted in the crashing of their ship into the islands. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his lyre and played music that was more beautiful and louder, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs.\n\nThe \"Argo\" then came to the island of Crete, guarded by the bronze man, Talos. As the ship approached, Talos hurled huge stones at the ship, keeping it at bay. Talos had one blood vessel which went from his neck to his ankle, bound shut by only one bronze nail (as in metal casting by the lost wax method). Medea cast a spell on Talos to calm him; she removed the bronze nail and Talos bled to death. The \"Argo\" was then able to sail on.\n\nThomas Bulfinch has an antecedent to the interaction of Medea and the daughters of Pelias. Jason, celebrating his return with the Golden Fleece, noted that his father was too aged and infirm to participate in the celebrations. He had seen and been served by Medea's magical powers. He asked Medea to take some years from his life and add them to the life of his father. She did so, but at no such cost to Jason's life. Medea withdrew the blood from Aeson's body and infused it with certain herbs; putting it back into his veins, returning vigor to him. Pelias' daughters saw this and wanted the same service for their father.\n\nMedea, using her sorcery, claimed to Pelias' daughters that she could make their father smooth and vigorous as a child by chopping him up into pieces and boiling the pieces in a cauldron of water and magical herbs. She demonstrated this remarkable feat with the oldest ram in the flock, which leapt out of the cauldron as a lamb. The girls, rather naively, sliced and diced their father and put him in the cauldron. Medea did not add the magical herbs, and Pelias was dead. Pelias' son, Acastus, drove Jason and Medea into exile for the murder, and the couple settled in Corinth.\n\nIn Corinth, Jason became engaged to marry Creusa (sometimes referred to as Glauce), a daughter of the King of Corinth, to strengthen his political ties. When Medea confronted Jason about the engagement and cited all the help she had given him, he retorted that it was not she that he should thank, but Aphrodite who made Medea fall in love with him. Infuriated with Jason for breaking his vow that he would be hers forever, Medea took her revenge by presenting to Creusa a cursed dress, as a wedding gift, that stuck to her body and burned her to death as soon as she put it on. Creusa's father, Creon, burned to death with his daughter as he tried to save her. Then Medea killed the two boys that she bore to Jason, fearing that they would be murdered or enslaved as a result of their mother's actions. When Jason came to know of this, Medea was already gone; she fled to Athens in a chariot of dragons sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios.\n\nLater Jason and Peleus, father of the hero Achilles, attacked and defeated Acastus, reclaiming the throne of Iolcus for himself once more. Jason's son, Thessalus, then became king.\n\nAs a result of breaking his vow to love Medea forever, Jason lost his favor with Hera and died lonely and unhappy. He was asleep under the stern of the rotting \"Argo\" when it fell on him, killing him instantly.\n\nThough some of the episodes of Jason's story draw on ancient material, the definitive telling, on which this account relies, is that of Apollonius of Rhodes in his epic poem \"Argonautica\", written in Alexandria in the late 3rd century BC.\n\nAnother \"Argonautica\" was written by Gaius Valerius Flaccus in the late 1st century AD, eight books in length. The poem ends abruptly with the request of Medea to accompany Jason on his homeward voyage. It is unclear if part of the epic poem has been lost, or if it was never finished. A third version is the \"Argonautica Orphica\", which emphasizes the role of Orpheus in the story.\n\nJason is briefly mentioned in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" in the poem \"Inferno\". He appears in the Canto XVIII. In it, he is seen by Dante and his guide Virgil being punished in Hell's Eighth Circle (Bolgia 1) by being driven to march through the circle for all eternity while being whipped by devils. He is included among the panderers and seducers (possibly for his seduction and subsequent abandoning of Medea).\n\nThe story of Medea's revenge on Jason is told with devastating effect by Euripides in his tragedy \"Medea\".\n\nThe mythical geography of the voyage of the Argonauts has been connected to specific geographic locations by Livio Stecchini but his theories have not been widely adopted.\n\nJason appeared in the \"Hercules\" episode \"Hercules and the Argonauts\" voiced by William Shatner. He is shown to have been a student of Philoctetes and takes his advice to let Hercules travel with him.\n\nIn \"The Heroes of Olympus\" story \"The Lost Hero,\" there was a reference to the mythical Jason when Jason Grace and his friends encounter Medea.\n\nBULLET::::- Cape Jason\nBULLET::::- Jason in popular culture\nBULLET::::- Mermeros and Pheres\n\nBULLET::::- Publius Ovidius Naso.

{"id": "15889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15889", "title": "Judah ha-Nasi", "text": "Judah ha-Nasi\n\nJudah ha-Nasi (, Yehudah HaNasi or Judah the Prince) or Judah I, was a second-century rabbi (a tanna of the fifth generation) and chief redactor and editor of the \"Mishnah\". He lived from approximately 135 to 217 CE. He was a key leader of the Jewish community during the Roman occupation of Judea.\n\nThe title \"nasi\" was used for presidents of the Sanhedrin. He was the first \"nasi\" to have this title added permanently to his name; in traditional literature he is usually called \"Rabbi Yehuda ha-Nasi.\" Often though (and always in the Mishnah), he is simply called \"Rabbi\" (), the master par excellence. He is occasionally called \"Rabbenu\" (= \"our master\"). He is also called \"Rabbenu HaQadosh\" (, \"our holy Master\") due to his deep piety.\n\nJudah the Prince was born in 135 CE to Simeon ben Gamliel II. According to the Talmud he was of the Davidic line. He is said to have been born on the same day that Rabbi Akiva died as a martyr. The Talmud suggests that this was a result of Divine Providence: God had granted the Jewish people another leader of great stature to succeed Rabbi Akiva. His place of birth is unknown.\n\nJudah spent his youth in the city of Usha. His father presumably gave him the same education that he himself had received, including the Greek language. This knowledge of Greek enabled him to become the Jews' intermediary with the Roman authorities. He favored Greek as the language of the country over Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. In Judah's house, only the Hebrew language was spoken, and the maids of the house became known for their use of obscure Hebrew terminology.\n\nJudah devoted himself chiefly to the study of the traditional and of the written law. In his youth he had close relations with most of the great students of Akiba; and as their student and in converse with other prominent men who gathered about his father at Usha and later at Shefar'am, he laid the foundations of that wide scholarship which enabled him to undertake his life-work, the redaction of the Mishnah.\n\nHis teacher at Usha was R' Judah bar Ilai, who was officially employed in the house of the patriarch as judge in religious and legal questions. In later years, Judah described how in his childhood he read the Book of Esther at Usha in the presence of Judah bar Ilai.\n\nJudah felt especial reverence for R' Jose ben Halafta, the student of Akiva's who had the closest relations with Simon ben Gamaliel. When, in later years, Judah raised objections to Jose's opinions, he would say: \"We poor ones undertake to attack Jose, though our time compares with his as the profane with the holy!\" Judah hands down a halakhah by Jose in Menachot 14a.\n\nJudah studied from R' Shimon bar Yochai in \"Tekoa\", a place some have identified with Meron. He also studied with Eleazar ben Shammua. Judah did not study with Rabbi Meir, evidently in consequence of the conflicts which distanced Meir from the house of the patriarch. However, he considered himself lucky even to have seen Meir from behind.\n\nAnother of Judah's teachers was Nathan the Babylonian, who also took a part in the conflict between Meir and the patriarch; Judah confessed that once, in a fit of youthful ardor, he had failed to treat Nathan with due reverence. In both halakhic and aggadic tradition, Judah's opinion is often opposed to Nathan's.\n\nIn the Palestinian tradition, Judah ben Korshai (the halakhic specialist mentioned as assistant to Simon ben Gamaliel) is designated as Judah's real teacher. Jacob ben Hanina (possibly the R. Jacob whose patronymic is not given and in whose name Judah quotes halakhic sentences) is also mentioned as one of Judah's teachers, and is said to have asked him to repeat halakhic sentences.\n\nJudah was also taught by his father (Simon ben Gamaliel); when the two differed on a halakhic matter, the father was generally stricter. Judah himself says: \"My opinion seems to me more correct than that of my father\"; and he then proceeds to give his reasons. Humility was a virtue ascribed to Judah, and he admired it greatly in his father, who openly recognized Shimon bar Yochai's superiority, thus displaying the same modesty as the Bnei Bathyra when they gave way to Hillel, and as Jonathan when he voluntarily gave precedence to his friend David.\n\nNothing is known regarding the time when Judah succeeded his father as leader of the Palestinian Jews. According to Rashi, Judah's father, Rabbi Simon ben Gamliel, had served as the \"nasi\" of the Sanhedrin in Usha, before it transferred to Shefar'am. According to a tradition, the country at the time of Simon ben Gamaliel's death not only was devastated by a plague of locusts, but suffered many other hardships. From Shefar'am, the Sanhedrin transferred to Beit Shearim, where the Sanhedrin was headed by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. Here he officiated for a long time. Eventually, Judah moved with the court from Beit Shearim to Sepphoris, where he spent at least 17 years of his life. He had chosen Sepphoris chiefly because of his ill-health, and being induced to go there because of the place's high altitude and pure air. However, Judah's memorial as a leader is principally associated with Bet She'arim: \"To Bet She'arim must one go in order to obtain Rabbi's decision in legal matters.\"\n\nAmong Judah's contemporaries in the early years of his activity were Eleazar ben Simeon, Ishmael ben Jose, Jose ben Judah, and Simeon ben Eleazar. His better-known contemporaries and students include Simon b. Manasseh, Phinehas ben Jair, Eleazar ha-Kappar and his son Bar Kappara, Hiyya the Great, Shimon ben Halafta, and Levi ben Sisi. Among his students who taught as the first generation of Amoraim after his death are: Hanina bar Hama and Hoshaiah in Palestine, Rav and Samuel in Babylon.\n\nOnly scattered records of Judah's official activity exist. These include: the ordination of his students; the recommendation of students for communal offices; orders relating to the announcement of the new moon; amelioration of the law relating to the Sabbatical year; and to decrees relating to tithes in the frontier districts of Palestine. The last-named he was obliged to defend against the opposition of the members of the patriarchal family. The ameliorations he intended for Tisha B'av were prevented by the college. Many religious and legal decisions are recorded as having been rendered by Judah together with his court, the college of scholars.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, Rabbi Judah HaNasi was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with \"Antoninus\", possibly the Emperor Antoninus Pius, though it is more likely his famous friendship was with either Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus or Antoninus who is also called Caracalla and who would consult Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters. Jewish sources tell of various discussions between Judah and Antoninus. These include the parable of the blind and the lame (illustrating the judgment of the body and the soul after death), and a discussion of the impulse to sin.\n\nThe authority of Judah's office was enhanced by his wealth, which is referred to in various traditions. In Babylon, the hyperbolic statement was later made that even his stable-master was wealthier than King Shapur. His household was compared to that of the emperor. Simeon ben Menasya praised Judah by saying that he and his sons united in themselves beauty, power, wealth, wisdom, age, honor, and the blessings of children. During a famine, Judah opened his granaries and distributed corn among the needy. But he denied himself the pleasures procurable by wealth, saying: \"Whoever chooses the delights of this world will be deprived of the delights of the next world; whoever renounces the former will receive the latter\".\n\nThe year of Judah's death is deduced from the statement that his student Rav left Palestine for good not long before Judah's death, in year 530 of the Seleucid era (219 CE). He assumed the office of patriarch during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (c. 165). Hence Judah, having been born about 135, became patriarch at the age of 30, and died at the age of about 85. The Talmud notes that Rabbi Judah the Prince lived for at least 17 years in Sepphoris, and that he applied unto himself the biblical verse, \"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years\" .\n\nAccording to a different calculation, he died on 15 Kislev, AM 3978 (around December 1, 217 CE), in Sepphoris, and his body was interred in the necropolis of Beit Shearim, distant from Sepphoris, during whose funeral procession they made eighteen stops at different stations along the route to eulogize him.\n\nIt is said that when Judah died, no one had the heart to announce his demise to the anxious people of Sepphoris, until the clever Bar Ḳappara broke the news in a parable, saying: \"The heavenly host and earth-born men held the tablets of the covenant; then the heavenly host was victorious and seized the tablets.\"\n\nJudah's eminence as a scholar, who gave to this period its distinctive impression, was characterized at an early date by the saying that since the time of Moses, the Torah and greatness (i.e. knowledge and rank) were united in no one to the same extent as in Judah I.\n\nVarious stories are told about Judah, illustrating different aspects of his character.\n\nIt is said that once he saw a calf being led to the slaughtering-block, which looked at him with tearful eyes, as if seeking protection. He said to it: \"Go; for you were created for this purpose!\" Due to this unkind attitude toward the suffering animal, he was punished with years of illness. Later, when his daughter was about to kill a small animal which was in her way, he said to her: \"Let it live, for it is written: '[God's] tender mercies are over all his works'.\" After this demonstration of compassion, his illness ceased. Judah also once said, \"One who is ignorant of the Torah should not eat meat.\" The prayer he prescribed upon eating meat or eggs also indicates an appreciation of animal life: \"Blessed be the Lord who has created many souls, in order to support by them the soul of every living being.\"\n\nJudah was easily moved to tears. He exclaimed, sobbing, in reference to three different stories of martyrs whose deaths made them worthy of future life: \"One man earns his world in an hour, while another requires many years\". He began to weep when Elisha ben Abuyah's daughters, who were soliciting alms, reminded him of their father's learning. In a legend relating to his meeting with Pinchas ben Yair, he is described as tearfully admiring the pious Pinchas' unswerving steadfastness, protected by a higher power. He was frequently interrupted by tears when explaining Lamentations 2:2 and illustrating the passage by stories of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple. While explaining certain passages of Scripture, he was reminded of divine judgment and of the uncertainty of acquittal, and began to cry. Hiyya found him weeping during his last illness because death was about to deprive him of the opportunity of studying the Torah and of fulfilling the commandments.\n\nOnce, when at a meal his students expressed their preference for soft tongue, he made this an opportunity to say, \"May your tongues be soft in your mutual intercourse\" (i.e., \"Speak gently without disputing\").\n\nBefore he died, Judah said: \"I need my sons! ... Let the lamp continue to burn in its usual place; let the table be set in its usual place; let the bed be made in its usual place.\"\n\nWhile teaching Torah, Judah would often interrupt the lesson to recite the Shema Yisrael. He passed his hand over his eyes as he said it.\n\nWhen 70-year-old wine cured him of a protracted illness, he prayed: \"Blessed be the Lord, who has given His world into the hands of guardians\".\n\nHe privately recited daily the following supplication on finishing the obligatory prayers: \"May it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, to protect me against the impudent and against impudence, from bad men and bad companions, from severe sentences and severe plaintiffs, whether a son of the covenant or not.\"\n\nRabbi Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg relates that the spirit of Rebbi Judah used to visit his home, wearing Shabbat clothes, every Friday evening at dusk. He would recite Kiddush, and others would thereby discharge their obligation to hear Kiddush. One Friday night there was a knock at the door. \"Sorry,\" said the maid, \"I can't let you in just now because Rabbeinu HaKadosh is in the middle of Kiddush.\" From then on Judah stopped coming, since he did not want his coming to become public knowledge.\n\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral law to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages (rabbinic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral traditions might be forgotten, Judah undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the \"Mishnah\". This completed a project which had been mostly clarified and organized by his father and Nathan the Babylonian.\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the \"Talmud.\" According to Abraham ben David, the \"Mishnah\" was compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince in anno mundi 3949, or the year 500 of the Seleucid era, which corresponds to 189 CE.\n\nThe Mishnah contains many of Judah's own sentences, which are introduced by the words, \"Rabbi says.\"\n\nThe Mishna was Judah's work, though it includes a few sentences by his son and successor, Gamaliel III, perhaps written after Judah's death. Both the Talmuds assume as a matter of course that Judah is the originator of the Mishnah—\"our Mishnah,\" as it was called in Babylon—and the author of the explanations and discussions relating to its sentences. However, Judah is more correctly consider redactor of the Mishna, rather than its author. The Mishna is based on the systematic division of the halakhic material as formulated by Rabbi Akiva; Judah following in his work the arrangement of the halakot as taught by Rabbi Meir (Akiva's foremost student). Judah's work in the Mishnah appears both in what he included and in what he rejected. The volume of tannaitic statements not included in the Mishna (but recorded in the Tosefta and in the baraitot of both Talmuds) shows that Judah had no small task in selecting the material that he included in his work. Also, the formulating of halakic maxims on controverted points required both his unusual technical knowledge and his undisputed authority; and the fact that he did not invariably lay down the rule, but always admitted divergent opinions and traditions both of the pre-Hadrianic time and, more especially, of Akiba's eminent students, demonstrates his circumspection and his consciousness of the limits imposed upon his authority by tradition and by its recognized representatives.\n\nUsing the precedent of Rabbi Meir's reported actions, Judah ruled the Beit Shean region to be exempt from the requirements of tithing and shmita regarding produce grown there. He also did the same for the cities of Kefar Tzemach, Caesarea and Beit Gubrin.\n\nHe forbade his students to study in the marketplace, basing his prohibition on his interpretation of Song of Songs 7:2, and censured one of his students who violated this restriction.\n\nHis exegesis includes many attempts to harmonize conflicting Biblical statements. Thus he harmonizes the contradictions between Genesis 15:13 (\"400 years\") and 15:16 (\"the fourth generation\"); Exodus 20:16 and Deuteronomy 5:18; Numbers 9:23, 10:35 and ib., Deuteronomy 14:13 and Leviticus 11:14. The contradiction between Genesis 1:25 (which lists 3 categories of created beings) and 1:24 (which adds a fourth category, the \"living souls\") Judah explains by saying that this expression designates the demons, for whom God did not create bodies because the Sabbath had come.\n\nNoteworthy among the other numerous Scriptural interpretations which have been handed down in Judah's name are his clever etymological explanations, for example: Exodus 19:8-9; Leviticus 23:40; Numbers 15:38; II Samuel 17:27; Joel 1:17; Psalms 68:7.\n\nHe interpreted the words \"to do the evil\" in II Samuel 12:9 to mean that David did not really sin with Bathsheba, but only intended to do so. Rav, Judah's student, ascribes this apology for King David to Judah's desire to justify his ancestor. A sentence praising King Hezekiah and an extenuating opinion of King Ahaz have also been handed down in Judah's name. Characteristic of Judah's appreciation of aggadah is his interpretation of the word \"vayagged\" (Exodus 19:9) to the effect that the words of Moses attracted the hearts of his hearers, like the aggadah does. Once when the audience was falling asleep in his lecture, he made a ludicrous statement in order to revive their interest, and then explained the statement to be accurate in a metaphorical sense.\n\nJudah was especially fond of the Book of Psalms. He paraphrased the David's wish \"Let the words of my mouth ... be acceptable in thy sight,\" thus: \"May the Psalms have been composed for the coming generations; may they be written down for them; and may those that read them be rewarded like those that study halakhic sentences\". He said that the Book of Job was important if only because it presented the sin and punishment of the generations of the Flood. He proves from Exodus 16:35 that there is no chronological order in the Torah. Referring to the prophetic books, he says: \"All the Prophets begin with denunciations and end with comfortings\". Even the genealogical portions of the Book of Chronicles must be interpreted.\n\nIt appears that there was an aggadic collection containing Judah's answers to exegetical questions. Among these questions may have been the one which Judah's son Simeon addressed to him.\n\nBULLET::::- What is the right way for man to choose? That which is honorable in his own eyes (i.e. approved by his conscience), and, at the same time, honorable in the eyes of his fellow-men.\nBULLET::::- Be as careful with a light mitzvah as a serious one, for you do not know the reward given for mitzvot. Calculate the loss of a mitzvah against its gain, and the gain of a sin against its loss. Look at three things and you will not come to sin: Know what is above you, an eye seeing and an ear listening, and all your deeds are written in a book.\nBULLET::::- Look not at the jar, but upon what is inside; many a new jug is full of old wine; and many an old jug does not even contain new wine.\nBULLET::::- Much have I learned from my teachers; more from my colleagues; but most from my students.\nBULLET::::- Why is the story of the Nazirite juxtaposed to the story of the suspected adulteress? In order to tell you that anyone who sees a suspected adulteress in her corrupted state, he should put himself under a vow never again to drink wine.\nBULLET::::- Let your secret be known only to yourself; and do not tell your neighbor anything which you perceive may not fitly be listened to.\nBULLET::::- Great is work, for whoever does not work, people speak about him: From what does that man eat? From what does he drink? ... Great is work, for whoever works, his hand is never missing a prutah.\n"}
{"id": "15890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15890", "title": "Jack Kerouac", "text": "Jack Kerouac\n\nJack Kerouac (; born Jean-Louis Kérouac (though he called himself Jean-Louis Lebris de Kérouac); March 12, 1922 – October 21, 1969) was an American novelist and poet of French-Canadian ancestry.\n\nHe is considered a literary iconoclast and, alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation. Kerouac is recognized for his method of spontaneous prose. Thematically, his work covers topics such as Catholic spirituality, jazz, promiscuity, Buddhism, drugs, poverty, and travel. He became an underground celebrity and, with other beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.\n\nIn 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking. Since his death, Kerouac's literary prestige has grown, and several previously unseen works have been published. All of his books are in print today, including \"The Town and the City\", \"On the Road\", \"Doctor Sax\", \"The Dharma Bums\", \"Mexico City Blues\", \"The Subterraneans\", \"Desolation Angels\", \"Visions of Cody\", \"The Sea Is My Brother\", \"Satori In Paris\", and \"Big Sur\".\n\nJack Kerouac was born on March 12, 1922 in Lowell, Massachusetts, to French Canadian parents, Léo-Alcide Kéroack (1899–1946) and Gabrielle-Ange Lévesque (1895–1973).\n\nThere is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of Kerouac, and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac. His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac. Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as Jean Louis Kirouac, the most common spelling of the name in Quebec. Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in Brittany, and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de Kervoac, whose sons married French Canadians.\n\nKerouac's father Leo had been born into a family of potato farmers in the village of Saint-Hubert-de-Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec. Jack also had various stories on the etymology of his surname, usually tracing it to Irish, Breton, Cornish or other Celtic roots.\n\nIn one interview he claimed it was from the name of the Cornish language (\"Kernewek\") and that the Kerouacs had fled from Cornwall to Brittany. Another version was that the Kerouacs had come to Cornwall from Ireland before the time of Christ and the name meant \"language of the house\". In still another interview he said it was an Irish word for \"language of the water\" and related to \"Kerwick\". Kerouac, derived from \"Kervoach\", is the name of a town in Brittany in Lanmeur, near Morlaix.\n\nJack Kerouac later referred to 34 Beaulieu Street as \"sad Beaulieu\". The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of rheumatic fever, aged nine. This deeply affected four-year-old Jack, who would later say that Gerard followed him in life as a guardian angel. This is the Gerard of Kerouac's novel \"Visions of Gerard\". He had one other sibling, an older sister named Caroline. Kerouac was referred to as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.\n\nKerouac spoke French until he began learning English at age six; he did not speak English confidently until his late teens. He was a serious child who was devoted to his mother, who played an important role in his life. She was a devout Catholic, who instilled this deep faith into both her sons. Kerouac would later say that his mother was the only woman he ever loved. After Gerard died, his mother sought solace in her faith, while his father abandoned it, wallowing in drinking, gambling, and smoking.\n\nSome of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend Allen Ginsberg towards the end of his life, he expressed a desire to speak his parents' native tongue again. In 2016, a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in French by Kerouac was published as \"La vie est d'hommage\".\n\nOn May 17, 1928, while six years old, Kerouac had his first Confession. For penance, he was told to say a rosary, during which he heard God tell him that he had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and die in pain and horror, but would in the end receive salvation. This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the Virgin Mary (as the nuns fawned over him, convinced he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.\n\nKerouac once told Ted Berrigan, in an interview for \"The Paris Review\", of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of New York. He recalled \"a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm ... teedah- teedah – teedah ... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so my father went POOM! and knocked a rabbi right in the gutter.\" Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.\n\nKerouac's athletic skills as a running back in football for Lowell High School earned him scholarship offers from Boston College, Notre Dame, and Columbia University. He entered Columbia University after spending a year at Horace Mann School, where he earned the requisite grades for entry to Columbia. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach Lou Little, who kept him benched. While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the \"Columbia Daily Spectator\", and joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He also studied at The New School.\n\nWhen his football career at Columbia ended, Kerouac dropped out of the university. He continued to live for a time in New York's Upper West Side with his girlfriend and future first wife, Edie Parker. It was during this time that he met the Beat Generation people—now famous—with whom he would always be associated, and who as characters formed the basis of many of his novels, including Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, John Clellon Holmes, Herbert Huncke, Lucien Carr and William S. Burroughs.\n\nKerouac joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1942 and in 1943 joined the United States Navy, but served only eight days of active duty before arriving on the sick list. According to his medical report, Kerouac said he \"asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me dementia praecox and sent me here.\" The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: \"I just can't stand it; I like to be by myself.\" Two days later he was honorably discharged on psychiatric grounds (he was of \"indifferent character\" with a diagnosis of \"schizoid personality\").\n\nWhile serving in the United States Merchant Marine, Kerouac wrote his first novel \"The Sea Is My Brother\". Although written in 1942, the book was not published until 2011, some 42 years after Kerouac's death and 70 years after it was written. Kerouac described the work as being about \"man's simple revolt from society as it is, with the inequalities, frustration, and self-inflicted agonies.\" He viewed the work as a failure, calling it a \"crock as literature\", and he never actively sought to publish it.\n\nIn 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a material witness in the murder of David Kammerer, who had been stalking Kerouac's friend Lucien Carr since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis. William Burroughs was also a native of St. Louis, and it was through Carr that Kerouac came to know both Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. According to Carr, Kammerer's homosexual obsession turned aggressive, finally provoking Carr to stab him to death in self-defense. Carr dumped the body in the Hudson River. Afterwards, Carr sought help from Kerouac. Kerouac disposed of the murder weapon and buried Kammerer's eyeglasses. Carr, encouraged by Burroughs, turned himself in to the police. Kerouac and Burroughs were later arrested as material witnesses. Kerouac's father refused to pay his bail. Kerouac then agreed to marry Edie Parker if her parents would pay the bail. (Their marriage was annulled in 1948.) Kerouac and Burroughs collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer killing entitled \"And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks\". Though the book was not published during their lifetimes, an excerpt eventually appeared in \"Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader\" (and as noted below, the novel was finally published late 2008). Kerouac also later wrote about the killing in his novel \"Vanity of Duluoz\".\n\nLater, Kerouac lived with his parents in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, after they had also moved to New York. He wrote his first published novel, \"The Town and the City\", and began the famous \"On the Road\" around 1949 when living there. His friends jokingly called him \"The Wizard of Ozone Park\", alluding to Thomas Edison's nickname, \"the Wizard of Menlo Park\", and to the film \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\n\"The Town and the City\" was published in 1950 under the name \"John Kerouac\" and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly. Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of Thomas Wolfe, it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger life of the city. The book was heavily edited by Robert Giroux, with around 400 pages taken out.\nFor the next six years, Kerouac continued to write regularly. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled \"The Beat Generation\" and \"Gone on the Road,\" Kerouac completed what is now known as \"On the Road\" in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty. The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with Neal Cassady in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends. He completed the first version of the novel during a three-week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. Kerouac wrote the final draft in 20 days, with Joan, his wife, supplying him with benzedrine, cigarettes, bowls of pea soup and mugs of coffee to keep him going. Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a long roll which he then fed into the machine. This allowed him to type continuously without the interruption of reloading pages. The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published. Though \"spontaneous,\" Kerouac had prepared long in advance before beginning to write. In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.\n\nThough the work was completed quickly, Kerouac had a long and difficult time finding a publisher. Before \"On the Road\" was accepted by Viking Press, Kerouac got a job as a \"railroad brakeman and fire lookout\" (see Desolation Peak (Washington)) traveling between the East and West coasts of the United States to earn money, frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother. While employed in this way he met and befriended Abe Green, a young freight train jumper who later introduced Kerouac to Herbert Huncke, a Times Square street hustler and favorite of many Beat Generation writers. During this period of travel, Kerouac wrote what he considered to be \"his life's work\": \"Vanity of Duluoz\". Between 1955-1956, he lived on and off with his sister, whom he called \"Nin,\" and her husband, Paul Blake, at their home outside of Rocky Mount, N.C. (\"Testament, Va.\" in his works) where he meditated on, and studied, Buddhism. He wrote \"Some of the Dharma\", an imaginative treatise on Buddhism, while living there.\n\nPublishers rejected \"On the Road\" because of its experimental writing style and its sexual content. Many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were, for the era, graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior—a move that could result in obscenity charges being filed, a fate that later befell Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\" and Ginsberg's \"Howl\".\n\nAccording to Kerouac, \"On the Road\" \"was really a story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him. I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God sweating out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about.\" According to his biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, \"On the Road\" has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but the most important thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.\n\nIn the spring of 1951, while pregnant, Joan Haverty left and divorced Kerouac. In February 1952, she gave birth to Kerouac's only child, Jan Kerouac, though he refused to acknowledge her as his daughter until a blood test confirmed it 9 years later. For the next several years Kerouac continued writing and traveling, taking long trips through the U.S. and Mexico. He often experienced episodes of heavy drinking and depression. During this period, he finished drafts of what would become ten more novels, including \"The Subterraneans\", \"Doctor Sax\", \"Tristessa\", and \"Desolation Angels\", which chronicle many of the events of these years.\n\nIn 1953, he lived mostly in New York City, having a brief but passionate affair with an African-American woman. This woman was the basis for the character named \"Mardou\" in the novel \"The Subterraneans\". At the request of his editors, Kerouac changed the setting of the novel from New York to San Francisco.\nIn 1954, Kerouac discovered Dwight Goddard's \"A Buddhist Bible\" at the San Jose Library, which marked the beginning of his study of Buddhism. However, Kerouac had earlier taken an interest in Eastern thought. In 1946 he read Heinrich Zimmer's \"Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization\". In 1955, Kerouac wrote a biography of Siddhartha Gautama, titled \"Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha\", which was unpublished during his lifetime, but eventually serialized in \"\", 1993–95. It was published by Viking in September 2008.\n\nKerouac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum, the right disdaining his association with drugs and sexual libertinism and the left contemptuous of his anti-communism and Catholicism; characteristically, he watched the 1954 Senate McCarthy hearings smoking marijuana and rooting for the anti-communist crusader, Senator Joseph McCarthy. In \"Desolation Angels\" he wrote, \"when I went to Columbia all they tried to teach us was Marx, as if I cared\" (considering Marxism, like Freudianism, to be an illusory tangent).\n\nIn 1957, after being rejected by several other publishers, \"On the Road\" was finally purchased by Viking Press, which demanded major revisions prior to publication. Many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and, fearing libel suits, pseudonyms were used for the book's \"characters.\" These revisions have often led to criticisms of the alleged spontaneity of Kerouac's style.\n\nIn July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house at 1418½ Clouser Avenue in the College Park section of Orlando, Florida, to await the release of \"On the Road\". Weeks later, a review of the book by Gilbert Millstein appeared in \"The New York Times\" proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation. Kerouac was hailed as a major American writer. His friendship with Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso, among others, became a notorious representation of the Beat Generation. The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac during a conversation held with fellow novelist Herbert Huncke. Huncke used the term \"beat\" to describe a person with little money and few prospects. \"I'm beat to my socks\", he had said. Kerouac's fame came as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing.\n\nKerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II Beat Generation and Kerouac came to be called \"the king of the beat generation,\" a term with which he never felt comfortable. He once observed, \"I'm not a beatnik. I'm a Catholic\", showing the reporter a painting of Pope Paul VI and saying, \"You know who painted that? Me.\"\n\nThe success of \"On the Road\" brought Kerouac instant fame. His celebrity status brought publishers desiring unwanted manuscripts that were previously rejected before its publication. After nine months, he no longer felt safe in public. He was badly beaten by three men outside the San Remo Cafe at 189 Bleecker Street in New York City one night. Neal Cassady, possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.\n\nIn response, Kerouac chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with Gary Snyder and other San Francisco-area poets, in \"The Dharma Bums\", set in California and Washington and published in 1958. It was written in Orlando between November 26 and December 7, 1957. To begin writing \"Dharma Bums\", Kerouac typed onto a ten-foot length of teleprinter paper, to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes, as he had done six years previously for \"On the Road\".\n\nKerouac was demoralized by criticism of \"Dharma Bums\" from such respected figures in the American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts. He wrote to Snyder, referring to a meeting with D.T. Suzuki, that \"even Suzuki was looking at me through slitted eyes as though I was a monstrous imposter.\" He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen \"I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit. I'm not a Buddhist any more.\" In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's café recitation, \"Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul\": \"A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light.\" Many consider that this clearly indicated Kerouac's journey on an emotional roller coaster of unprecedented adulation and spiritual demoralization.\n\nKerouac also wrote and narrated a beat movie titled \"Pull My Daisy\" (1959), directed by Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie. It starred poets Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso, musician David Amram and painter Larry Rivers among others. Originally to be called \"The Beat Generation\", the title was changed at the last moment when MGM released a film by the same name in July 1959 that sensationalized beatnik culture.\n\nThe television series \"Route 66\" (1960–1964), featuring two untethered young men \"on the road\" in a Corvette seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary jobs in the various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, gave the impression of being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for \"On the Road\". Even the leads, Buz and Todd, bore a resemblance to the dark, athletic Kerouac and the blonde Cassady/Moriarty, respectively. Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by \"Route 66\" creator Stirling Silliphant and sought to sue him, CBS, the Screen Gems TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action.\n\nJohn Antonelli's 1985 documentary \"Kerouac, the Movie\" begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from \"On the Road\" and \"Visions of Cody\" on \"The Steve Allen Plymouth Show\" in November 1959. Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. \"Are you nervous?\" asks Steve Allen. \"Naw,\" says Kerouac, sweating and fidgeting.\n\nIn 1965, he met the poet Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends. Gwernig used to translate his Breton language poems in English so that Kerouac could read and understand them : \"Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really like to read them ! ... ' So I wrote an Diri Dir – Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English.\"\n\nIn the following years, Kerouac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1966. In 1968, Neal Cassady also died while in Mexico.\n\nDespite the role which his literary work played in inspiring the counterculture movement of the 1960s, Kerouac was not fond of the movement and also openly criticized it. Arguments over the movement, which Kerouac believed was only an excuse to be \"spiteful,\" also resulted in him splitting with Ginsberg by 1968.\n\nAlso in 1968, he appeared on the television show \"Firing Line\" produced and hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. (a friend of Kerouac's from his college years). Kerouac talked about the counterculture of the 1960s in what would be his last appearance on television.\n\nAt eleven o'clock, on the morning of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his favorite chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, working on a book about his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts. He suddenly felt nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an esophageal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse. A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier. He is buried at Edson Cemetery, Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was living with his third wife, Stella Sampas Kerouac, and his mother Gabrielle. Kerouac's mother inherited most of his estate.\n\nHe was honored posthumously with a Doctor of Letters degree from his hometown University of Massachusetts Lowell on June 2, 2007.\n\nKerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although he actively disliked such labels. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of\njazz, especially the Bebop genre established by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and others. Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his Buddhist studies that began with Gary Snyder. He often referred to his style as \"spontaneous prose.\" Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or \"roman à clef\") based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted.\nMany of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including \"On the Road\", \"Visions of Cody\", \"Visions of Gerard\", \"Big Sur\", and \"The Subterraneans\". The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of breath was the elimination of the period, substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble improvisational jazz licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.\n\nKerouac greatly admired and was influenced by Gary Snyder. \"The Dharma Bums\" contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder. While living with Snyder outside Mill Valley, California, in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling \"Visions of Gary\". (This eventually became \"Dharma Bums\", which Kerouac described as \"mostly about [Snyder].\") That summer, Kerouac took a job as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascades in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters. On Desolation Peak he'd hoped to \"come face to face with God or Tathagata and find out once and for all what is the meaning of all this existence. But instead I'd come face to face with myself ... and many's the time I thought I'd die of boredom or jump off the mountain.\" Kerouac described the experience in \"Desolation Angels\" and later in \"The Dharma Bums\".\n\nKerouac would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method. Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem \"Howl\". It was at about the time of \"The Subterraneans\" that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style. Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was \"Belief and Technique for Modern Prose\", a list of 30 \"essentials\".\n\nSome believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. Truman Capote famously said about Kerouac's work \"That's not writing, it's typing\". According to Carolyn Cassady and others, he constantly rewrote and revised his work.\n\nAlthough the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has shown that, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. The existence of his two novels written in French, \"La nuit est ma femme\" and \"Sur le chemin\" was revealed to the general public in a series of articles published by journalist Gabriel Anctil, in the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir in 2007 and 2008. All these works, including \"La nuit est ma femme\", \"Sur le chemin\", and large sections of \"Maggie Cassidy\" (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled \"La vie est d'hommage\" (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the \"Nouvelle Revue Française\" had already published excerpts and an article on \"La nuit est ma femme\", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography \"Kerouac: His Life and Work', \" discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French. Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become \"Old Bull in the Bowery\" (now published in \"The Unknown Kerouac\" from the Library of America). \"The Unknown Kerouac,\" edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of \"La nuit est ma femme\" and the completed translation of \"Sur le Chemin\" under the title \"Old Bull in the Bowery\". \"La nuit est ma femme\" was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of \"On the Road\", as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, Gabriel Anctil , and Yannis Livadas have pointed out. \n\nKerouac's early writing, particularly his first novel \"The Town and the City\", was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of Thomas Wolfe. The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by jazz, especially Bebop, and later, Buddhism, as well as the famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady. The Diamond Sutra was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and \"probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read\". In 1955, he began an intensive study of this sutra, in a repeating weekly cycle, devoting one day to each of the six Pāramitās, and the seventh to the concluding passage on Samādhi. This was his sole reading on Desolation Peak, and he hoped by this means to condition his mind to emptiness, and possibly to have a vision.\n\nAn often overlooked literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes to more than any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding \"On the Road\", he wrote in a letter to Ginsberg, \"I can tell you now as I look back on the flood of language. It is like \"Ulysses\" and should be treated with the same gravity.\" Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel \"Visions of Cody\", which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.\n\nJack Kerouac and his literary works had a major impact on the popular rock music of the 1960s. Artists including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, the Grateful Dead, and The Doors all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles. This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel \"On the Road\" as one of the band's greatest influences. In his book \"Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors\", Ray Manzarek (keyboard player of The Doors) wrote \"I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written \"On the Road\", The Doors would never have existed.\" The alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs wrote a song bearing his name, \"Hey Jack Kerouac\" on their 1987 album \"In My Tribe\". The 2000 Barenaked Ladies song, Baby Seat, from the album Maroon, references Kerouac.\n\nIn 1974, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at Naropa University, a private Buddhist university in Boulder, Colorado. The school offers a BA in Writing and Literature, MFAs in Writing & Poetics and Creative Writing, and a summer writing program.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1992, Joy Walsh published 28 issues of a magazine devoted to Kerouac, \"Moody Street Irregulars\".\n\nKerouac's French-Canadian origins inspired a 1987 National Film Board of Canada docudrama \"Jack Kerouac's Road: A Franco-American Odyssey\", directed by Acadian poet Herménégilde Chiasson.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Kerouac Park was placed in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nA street, \"rue de Jack Kérouac\", is named after him in Quebec City, as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, Lanmeur, Brittany. An annual Kerouac festival was established in Lanmeur in 2010. In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco named a one-way street, Jack Kerouac Alley, in his honor in Chinatown.\n\nIn 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where \"The Dharma Bums\" was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc. This group provides opportunities for aspiring writers to live in the same house in which Kerouac was inspired, with room and board covered for three months. In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist Oscar J. Corral that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia. The article, citing legal documents, showed that Kerouac's estate, worth only $91 at the time of his death, was worth $10 million in 1998.\n\nIn 2007, Kerouac was awarded a posthumous honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.\n\nIn 2009, the movie \"One Fast Move or I'm Gone – Kerouac's Big Sur\" was released. It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel \"Big Sur\", with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book. The movie also describes the people and places on which Kerouac based his characters and settings, including the cabin in Bixby Canyon. An album released to accompany the movie, \"One Fast Move or I'm Gone\", features Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jay Farrar (Son Volt) performing songs based on Kerouac's \"Big Sur\".\n\nIn 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival \"Lowell Celebrates Kerouac\" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of Lowell, Massachusetts. It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.\n\nIn the 2010s, there was a surge in films based on the Beat Generation. Kerouac has been depicted in the films \"Howl\" and \"Kill Your Darlings\". A feature film version of \"On the Road\" was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by Walter Salles and produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Independent filmmaker Michael Polish directed \"Big Sur\", based on the novel, with Jean-Marc Barr cast as Kerouac. The film was released in 2013.\n\nA species of Indian platygastrid wasp that is phoretic (hitch-hiking) on grasshoppers is named after him as \"Mantibaria kerouaci\".\n\nWhile he is best known for his novels, Kerouac is also noted for his poetry. Kerouac said that he wanted \"to be considered as a jazz poet blowing a long blues in an afternoon jazz session on Sunday.\". Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism. \"Mexico City Blues,\" a collection of poems published in 1959, is made up of 242 choruses following the rhythms of jazz. In much of his poetry, to achieve a jazz-like rhythm, Kerouac made use of the long dash in place of a period. Several examples of this can be seen in \"Mexico City Blues\":\n\nOther well-known poems by Kerouac, such as \"Bowery Blues,\" incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of Saṃsāra, the cycle of life and death, and Samadhi, the concentration of composing the mind. Also, following the jazz / blues tradition, Kerouac's poetry features repetition and themes of the troubles and sense of loss experienced in life.\n\nIn 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of \"On the Road\"'s publishing, Viking issued two new editions: \"On the Road: The Original Scroll,\" and \"On the Road: 50th Anniversary Edition\". By far the more significant is \"Scroll,\" a transcription of the original draft typed as one long paragraph on sheets of tracing paper which Kerouac taped together to form a scroll. The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay paid $2.43 million for the original scroll and allowed an exhibition tour that concluded at the end of 2009. The other new issue, \"50th Anniversary Edition,\" is a reissue of the 40th anniversary issue under an updated title.\n\nThe Kerouac/Burroughs manuscript, \"And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks\" was published for the first time on November 1, 2008 by Grove Press. Previously, a fragment of the manuscript had been published in the Burroughs compendium, \"Word Virus\".\n\nLes Éditions du Boréal, a Montreal-based publishing house, obtained rights from Kerouac's estate to publish a collection of works titled \"La vie est d'hommage\" (it was released in April 2016). It includes 16 previously unpublished works, in French, including a novella, \"Sur le chemin\", \"La nuit est ma femme,\" and large sections of \"Maggie Cassidy\" originally written in French. Both \"Sur le chemin\" and \"La nuit est ma femme\" have also been translated to English by Jean-Christophe Cloutier, in collaboration with Kerouac, and were published in 2016 by the Library of America in \"The Unknown Kerouac\".\n\nBULLET::::- \"Poetry for the Beat Generation\" (with Steve Allen) (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"Blues and Haikus\" (with Al Cohn and Zoot Sims) (1959)\nBULLET::::- \"Readings by Jack Kerouac on the Beat Generation\" (1960)\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Jack Kerouac Collection\" (1990) [Box] (Audio CD collection of three studio albums)\nBULLET::::- \"Jack Kerouac Reads On the Road\" (1999)\n\n\nBULLET::::- Amburm, Ellis. \"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac\".

{"id": "15893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15893", "title": "Jeff Mills", "text": "Jeff Mills\n\nJeff Mills (born June 18, 1963, in Detroit, Michigan) is an American DJ, record producer and composer. Thanks to his technical abilities as a DJ, Mills became known as \"The Wizard\" in the early to mid 1980s. In the late 1980s Mills founded the techno collective Underground Resistance with fellow Detroit techno producers 'Mad' Mike Banks and Robert Hood but left the group to pursue a career as a solo artist in the early 90s. Mills founded Axis Records in 1992. The label is based in Chicago, Illinois and is responsible for the release of much of his solo work.\n\nMills has received international recognition for his work both as a DJ and producer. Mills was also featured in \"Man From Tomorrow\", a documentary about techno music that he produced along with French filmmaker Jacqueline Caux. He continued working in film, releasing \"Life to Death and Back\", a film he shot in the Egyptian wing of the Louvre Museum where he also had a four-month residency. In 2017 the French Minister of Culture Jack Lang awarded Mills the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his services to the arts.\n\nA 1981 graduate of Mackenzie High School, Mills started his career in the early 1980s using the name \"The Wizard.\" He performed DJ tricks like beat juggling and scratching during his sets, some of which were pre-recorded. He had a nightly show called The Wizard at WDRQ and later at WJLB under the same name. He would highlight local techno artists, giving light to artists such as Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and Juan Atkins.\n\nIn his early career, Mills managed numerous residencies in the Detroit area. He credits The Necto as the residency where he was able to experiment with new ideas in techno music. Mills played The Necto where he began incorporating concepts such as different equipment setups, including positioning himself on the dance floor with the people. For his radio DJ spots, Mills had a music spending budget to use for his sets. Mills would also drive as far as Toronto or Chicago in order to purchase newly released music.\n\nMills is a founding member of Underground Resistance, a techno collective that he started with former Parliament bass player 'Mad' Mike Banks. The group embraced revolutionary rhetoric and only appeared in public dressed in ski masks and black combat suits. Mills never \"officially\" left the group, but did begin to pursue his own ventures outside of the collective. Many of Underground Resistance's labelmate's early releases were the product of various experiments by Banks and Mills, both solo and in collaboration, before Mills left the collective in 1991 to achieve international success as a solo artist and DJ. The collective continues to be a mainstay of Detroit's music scene.\n\nUR related the aesthetics of early Detroit Techno to the complex social, political, and economic circumstances which followed on from Reagan-era inner-city economic recession, producing uncompromising music geared toward promoting awareness and facilitating political change. UR's songs created a sense of self-exploration, experimentation and the ability to change yourself and circumstances. Additionally, UR wanted to establish a means of identification beyond traditional lines of race and ethnicity. Another form of UR's rebellion concerns the rejection of the commercialization of techno. This is evident in the messages scratched in UR's records, lyrics and sounds expressing economic independence from major record labels.\n\nMills left Underground Resistance in 1991 to pursue his own ventures. He relocated from Detroit, first to New York, then Berlin (as a resident at the Tresor club), and then Chicago. There in 1992, with fellow Detroit native Robert Hood, he set up the record label Axis, and later, sub-labels Purpose Maker, Tomorrow, and 6277, all aiming for a more minimal sound than most of the techno being produced in those years.\n\nMills released \"Blue Potential\" in 2006, a live album of him playing with the 70 piece Montpelier Philharmonic Orchestra in 2005. The album was a remix for classical interpretation, following musical acts such as Radiohead. In 2013, he released Where Light Ends, an album inspired by the Japanese astronaut Mamoru Mohri and his first trip to space.\nIn 2018, Mills recorded E.P. \"Tomorrow Comes The Harvest\" with legendary afro-jazz drummer Tony Allen.\n\nMills performed a live set in January 2015 at the Jewish Community Center in San Francisco, California. The set was performed with four turntables to create a cinemix soundtrack for Woman in the Moon, the 1929 silent film from Fritz Lang. The set was performed during a screening of the film at the center. Mills has previously completed work highlighting Lang's career, including composing, performing, and releasing a soundtrack to Lang's 1927 silent film Metropolis, releasing the soundtrack in 2000.\n\nMills became involved in film with the help of French filmmaker Jacqueline Caux. He helped Caux produce the film \"Man From Tomorrow\", a documentary about techno music that featured Mills. He continued in the film industry with the release of the independent film \"Life to Death and Back\" which he shot in the Egyptian wing of the Louvre Museum in France, the same museum where he had a four-month residency.\n\nIn his DJ sets, Mills usually uses three decks, a Roland TR-909 drum-machine, and up to seventy records in one hour. Mills' \"Exhibitionist\" DVD, from 2004, features him mixing live on three decks and CD player in a studio. In 2011, Mills switched to using three or four CD decks for most of his club appearances, instead of the usual Technics turntables.\n\nHe was mentioned by Detroit rapper Eminem in his song \"Groundhog Day\", from his album \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\". Eminem says: \"...and discovered this DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizzard, you ain't have a fu**ing clue what you was missing...\"\n\nMills is also an artist and has shown his works at exhibits internationally. His works have included \"Man of Tomorrow,\" a portrait of Mills that shows his perception of the future as well as \"Critical Arrangements\" exhibited at Pompidou Centre in 2008 as a part of \"Le Futurisme à Paris – une avant-garde explosive.\" One of his most notable works was exhibited in 2015.

{"id": "15898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15898", "title": "John Major", "text": "John Major\n\nSir John Major (born 29 March 1943) is a British politician who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1997. Previously the foreign secretary and then chancellor of the Exchequer in the Thatcher Government from 1989 to 1990, he was member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of Margaret Thatcher in 2013, Major has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all living former prime ministers.\n\nBorn in St Helier, Surrey, Major grew up in Brixton. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the London Electricity Board, before becoming an executive at Standard Chartered. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1979 general election as MP for Huntingdon. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the Gulf War in March 1991, and negotiated the Maastricht Treaty in December 1991. He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14 million votes at the 1992 general election, albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as Black Wednesday (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the Northern Ireland peace process, by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by John Redwood but was easily re-elected. By this time, the Labour Party had moved toward the centre under the leadership of Tony Blair and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996. Major went on to lose the 1997 general election five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the Great Reform Act of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by William Hague as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the 2001 general election. In 1999, a BBC Radio 4 poll ranked him 17th of 19 among 20th-century British prime ministers; in 2016, a University of Leeds survey ranked him 6th of 13 among post-war prime ministers.\n\nMajor was born on 29 March 1943 at St Helier Hospital and Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in St Helier, Surrey, the son of Gwen Major ( Coates, 1905–1970) and former music hall performer Tom Major-Ball (1879–1962), who was sixty-three years old when Major was born. He was christened \"John Roy Major\" but only \"John Major\" was recorded on his birth certificate. He used his middle name until the early 1980s. Major grew up in Longfellow Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, where he attended primary school at Cheam Common and from 1954, he attended Rutlish School, a grammar school in the London Borough of Merton.\n\nIn 1955, with his father's garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to Brixton. The following year, Major watched his first debate in the House of Commons, where Harold Macmillan presented his only Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and has attributed his political ambitions to that event. He also credited a chance meeting with former Prime Minister Clement Attlee on the King's Road shortly afterwards.\n\nMajor left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with three O-levels in History, English Language and English Literature. He later gained three more O-levels by correspondence course, in the British Constitution, Mathematics and Economics.\n\nMajor's first job was as a clerk in the London-based insurance brokerage firm Pratt & Sons in 1959. Disliking this job, he resigned. Major joined the Young Conservatives in Brixton at this time. Major was almost nineteen years old when his father died, at the age of 82 on 27 March 1962. His mother died eight years later in September 1970, at the age of 65.\n\nAfter Major became Prime Minister, it was misreported that his failure to get a job as a bus conductor resulted from his failing to pass a maths test. He had in fact passed all of the necessary tests but had been passed over owing to his height.\n\nAfter a period of unemployment, Major started working at the London Electricity Board in 1963 which is where incidentally his successor as Prime Minister, Tony Blair, also worked when he was young. He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the Standard Chartered Bank in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks. He was sent to work in Jos, Nigeria, by the bank in 1967 and he nearly died in a car accident there.\n\nMajor was interested in politics from an early age. Encouraged by fellow Conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a soap-box in Brixton Market. He stood as a candidate for Lambeth London Borough Council at the age of 21 in 1964, and was elected in the Conservative landslide in 1968. While on the Council he was Chairman of the Housing Committee, being responsible for overseeing the building of several large council housing estates. He lost his seat in 1971.\n\nMajor was an active Young Conservative, and according to his biographer Anthony Seldon brought \"youthful exuberance\" to the Tories in Brixton, but was often in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing. Also according to Seldon, the formative political influence on Major was Jean Kierans, a divorcée 13 years his elder, who became his political mentor and his lover, too. Seldon writes \"She ... made Major smarten his appearance, groomed him politically, and made him more ambitious and worldly.\" Their relationship lasted from 1963 to sometime after 1968.\n\nMajor stood for election to Parliament in St Pancras North in general elections in February and October 1974, but was unsuccessful each time. In November 1976, Major was selected to be the candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Huntingdonshire. He won the seat in the 1979 general election. Following boundary changes, Major became the MP for the newly formed seat of Huntingdon in 1983, and retained the seat in 1987, 1992 and 1997. He retired from Parliament in 2001.\n\nHe was appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary in January 1981, becoming an assistant whip in 1983. He was later made Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in 1985, before being promoted to become Minister of State in the same department in September 1986, first attracting national media attention over cold weather payments to the elderly in January 1987, when Britain was in the depths of a severe winter.\n\nFollowing the 1987 election, Major was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded Geoffrey Howe as Foreign Secretary. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer after the sudden resignation of Nigel Lawson. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the Great Offices of State.\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as \"a budget for savings\" and announced the Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household savings ratio that had been apparent during the previous financial year. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard ecu\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and Douglas Hurd, Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.\n\nAfter Michael Heseltine challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party in November 1990, Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign – it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and Michael Heseltine to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since Stanley Baldwin (under George V between 1935 and 1936).\n\nThe UK economy entered a recession during 1990, which deepened in 1991, with unemployment rising rapidly. The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first Gulf War, playing a key role in persuading US President George H. W. Bush to support no-fly zones. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an IRA assassination attempt by mortar attack. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since Harold Macmillan in the early 1960s.\n\nIn spite of Labour Leader Neil Kinnock's repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting negative campaign advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win – or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a hung parliament or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14 million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged. Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking Norman Lamont as Chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing him with Kenneth Clarke. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in Newbury. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the Maastricht dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily. The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible exchange rates, allowing lower interest rates and devaluation, thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7 million.\n\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" – by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the Maastricht Treaty, and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the Eurosceptic wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the Maastricht Rebels, voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a vote of confidence. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to ITN's Michael Brunson. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18 ... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's Lyndon B. Johnson's maxim?\" Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\", but many journalists suggested that the three were Peter Lilley, Michael Portillo and Michael Howard, three of the more prominent \"Eurosceptics\" within his Cabinet. Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with John Redwood's name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the \"Daily Mirror\" and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of Margaret Thatcher – while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, Anthony Eden – who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, Jacques Santer, instead. Around this time Major – who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader John Smith as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" – tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue Tony Marlow called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with mad cow disease – the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the Beef war. By April 2013, vCJD – the human form of the disease had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor Ken Clarke, favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire Sir James Goldsmith had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in Bosnia. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that air strikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The Clinton administration, by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting air strikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" (Douglas Hurd and others strongly opposed this policy).\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable. To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.\n\nMajor opened talks with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with Mr Adams and the Provisional IRA ... would turn my stomach\", Sinn Féin gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The Downing Street Declaration was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and Albert Reynolds, the Irish Taoiseach, with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"Mitchell Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President Bill Clinton for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the White House for St Patrick's Day.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major privatised British Rail, splitting it up into franchises to be run by the private sector. The process was controversial at the time, and the effect of privatising the railway is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy and concern about foreign companies running British railways.\n\nAt the 1993 Conservative Party Conference, Major began the \"Back to Basics\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and family values that they associated with the Conservative Party.\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by tabloid newspapers such as \"The Sun\". In 1992, David Mellor, a cabinet minister, had been exposed as having an extramarital affair and for accepting hospitality from the daughter of a leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The wife of Lord Caithness committed suicide amongst rumours of the peer committing adultery. Stephen Milligan was found dead having apparently auto-asphyxiated whilst performing a solitary sex act (his Eastleigh seat was lost in what was to be an ongoing stream of heavy by-election defeats). David Ashby was \"outed\" by his wife after sleeping with men. A string of other Conservative MPs, including Alan Amos, Tim Yeo, and Michael Brown, were involved in sexual scandals.\n\nOther debilitating scandals included \"Arms to Iraq\" – the ongoing inquiry into how government ministers including Alan Clark (also involved in an unrelated scandal involving the revelation of his affair with the wife and both daughters of a South African judge) had encouraged businesses to supply arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, in breach of the official arms embargo, and how senior ministers had, on legal advice, attempted to withhold evidence of this official connivance when directors of Matrix Churchill were put on trial for breaking the embargo.\n\nAnother scandal was \"Cash for Questions\", in which first Graham Riddick, and David Tredinnick accepted money to ask questions in the House of Commons in a newspaper \"sting\", and later Tim Smith and Neil Hamilton were found to have received money from Mohamed Al-Fayed, also to ask questions in the House. Later, David Willetts resigned as Paymaster General after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with \"Cash for Questions\".\n\nDefence Minister Jonathan Aitken was accused by the ITV investigative journalism series \"World in Action\" and \"The Guardian\" newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against \"The Guardian\" and the producers of \"World in Action\" Granada Television. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries – the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.\n\nAlthough Tim Smith stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter Martin Bell, who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s) ... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"\n\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting leadership election – he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. John Redwood resigned as Secretary of State for Wales to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.\n\n\"The Sun\" newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".\n\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, in order to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even \"The Sun\" newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for Tony Blair's \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the worst electoral defeat by a ruling party since the Reform Act 1832. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until 2010, and did not win a parliamentary majority until 2015, which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to Buckingham Palace to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside 10 Downing Street in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage—and that is what I propose to do.\" Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to The Oval to watch Surrey play cricket.\n\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. Lord Cranborne, his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, Alastair Goodlad, both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor. Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"\n\nMajor served as Leader of the Opposition for seven weeks while the leadership election to replace him was underway. He formed a temporary Shadow Cabinet, but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs. Major himself served as Shadow Foreign Secretary and Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, and the office of Shadow Scotland Secretary was left vacant until after the 2001 general election as the party had no MPs from Scotland. Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of William Hague. His Resignation Honours were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates. He stood down from the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, having announced his retirement live on BBC One's breakfast television show with David Frost in October 2000.\n\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher, and made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the European Union. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by Bill Cash and Margaret Thatcher inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which Margaret Thatcher had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of Tony Blair as Labour leader in July 1994.\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990–1992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75 million when I took office, and at 1.6 million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from £0.5 billion to nearly £46 billion at its peak before falling to £1 billion\". Ken Clarke stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that Tony Blair's legacy appeared to be in decline.\n\nThe former Labour MP Tony Banks said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council. Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, 'What on earth is Councillor Major doing?' I can't believe he's here and sometimes I think he can't either.\" Paddy Ashdown, the Leader of the Liberal Democrats during Major's term of office, once described him in the House of Commons as a \"decent and honourable man\". Few observers doubted that he was an honest man, or that he made sincere and sometimes successful attempts to improve life in Britain and to unite his deeply divided party. He was also perceived as a weak and ineffectual figure, and his approval ratings for most of his time in office were low, particularly after \"Black Wednesday\" in September 1992. Conversely on occasions he attracted criticism for pursuing schemes favoured by the right of his party, notably the privatisation of British Rail.\n\nSince leaving office, Major has maintained a low profile, indulging his love of cricket as President of Surrey County Cricket Club until 2002 (and Honorary Life Vice-President since 2002) and commentating on political developments in the manner of an elder statesman. He has been a member of the Carlyle Group's European Advisory Board since 1998 and was appointed Chairman of Carlyle Europe in May 2001. He stood down in August 2004.\n\nLike some post-war former Prime Ministers (such as Ted Heath), Major turned down a peerage when he retired from the House of Commons in 2001. He said that he wanted a \"firebreak from politics\" and to focus on writing and his business, sporting and charity work. He now supports a number of charities, including sight loss and learning disability charity SeeAbility, for whom he has acted as Vice President since 2013.\n\nIn March 2001, he gave the tribute to Colin Cowdrey (Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge) at his memorial service in Westminster Abbey. In 2005, he was elected to the Committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), historically the governing body of the sport, and still guardian of the laws of the game. Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, Major was appointed a special guardian to Princes William and Harry, with responsibility for legal and administrative matters. As a result of this, Major was the only current or former Prime Minister out of the five still alive invited to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May 2018.\n\nAn oil painting of Major, painted in 1996 by June Mendoza, is part of the parliamentary collection, as is a bronze bust by Anne Curry.\n\nMajor is the author of three books:\nBULLET::::- \"John Major: The Autobiography\"\nBULLET::::- \"More than a Game\", a history of cricket\nBULLET::::- \"My Old Man\", a history of Music Hall\n\nMajor's low profile following his exit from parliament was disrupted by Edwina Currie's revelation in September 2002 that, prior to his promotion to the Cabinet, he had had a four-year extramarital affair with her. Commentators were quick to refer to Major's previous \"Back to Basics\" platform to throw charges of hypocrisy, and an obituary of Tony Newton in \"The Daily Telegraph\" claimed that if Newton had not kept the affair a closely guarded secret \"it is highly unlikely that Major would have become prime minister\".\n\nIn 1993, Major had also sued two magazines, \"New Statesman and Society\" and \"Scallywag\", as well as their distributors, for reporting rumours of an affair with a caterer, even though at least one of the magazines had said that the rumours were false. Both considered legal action to recover their costs when the affair with Currie was revealed.\n\nIn a press statement, Major said that he was \"ashamed\" by the affair and that his wife had forgiven him. In response, Currie said \"he wasn't ashamed of it at the time and he wanted it to continue.\"\n\nIn February 2005, it was reported that Major and Norman Lamont delayed the release of papers on Black Wednesday under the Freedom of Information Act. Major denied doing so, saying that he had not heard of the request until the scheduled release date and had merely asked to look at the papers himself. He told BBC News that he and Lamont had been the victims of \"whispering voices\" to the press. He later publicly approved the release of the papers.\n\nMajor has become an active after-dinner speaker. He earns over £25,000 per engagement for his \"insights and his own opinions\" according to his agency.\n\nIn December 2006, Major led calls for an independent inquiry into Tony Blair's decision to invade Iraq, following revelations made by Carne Ross, a former British senior diplomat, that contradict Blair's case for the invasion. He was touted as a possible Conservative candidate for the Mayor of London elections in 2008, but turned down an offer from Conservative leader David Cameron. A spokesperson for Major said \"his political career is behind him\".\n\nIn 2010, Major became a key loyalist to the Cameron–Clegg coalition, and stated that he hoped for a \"liberal conservative\" alliance beyond 2015, and criticised Ed Miliband and Labour for \"party games\" rather than helping in the national interest.\nIn February 2012, Major became chairman of the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. The trust was formed as part of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, and is intended to support charitable organisations and projects across the Commonwealth of Nations, focusing on areas such as cures for diseases and the promotion of culture and education. Later on in 2012, John Major became President of influential centre-right think tank the Bow Group.\n\nHe is currently a president of the Chatham House think tank and advises Credit Suisse.\n\nJohn Major supports a second referendum over Brexit. He said that the leave campaign put out a \"fantasy case\" during the 2016 referendum, to describe a second vote as undemocratic was \"a rather curious proposition\" and he could see no \"intellectual argument\" against redoing the ballot. Major fears Brexit will make the UK poorer and border problems in Ireland could endanger peace there.\n\nOn 21 April 2018, he attended the funeral of former US First Lady Barbara Bush at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas. On 5 December, he also attended the state funeral of former US President George H. W. Bush.\n\nOn 30 August 2019, it was announced by diverse media that Major intended to join a court case by Gina Miller against the proroguing of Parliament by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\n\nIn 2019 Major urged voters to vote tactically against candidates supporting Boris Johnson when those candidates wanted a hard Brexit. Major said Brexit is, “the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime. It will affect nearly every single aspect of our lives for many decades to come. It will make our country poorer and weaker. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom.”\n\nDuring his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest (\"Honest John\") but unable to rein in the philandering and bickering within his party. Major's appearance was noted in its greyness, his prodigious philtrum, and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in \"Spitting Image\", Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague Virginia Bottomley – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with Edwina Currie, which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\".\n\nThe media (particularly \"The Guardian\" cartoonist Steve Bell) used the allegation by Alastair Campbell that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to caricature him wearing his pants outside his trousers, as a pale grey echo of both Superman and Supermac, a parody of Harold Macmillan. Bell also used the humorous possibilities of the Cones Hotline, a means for the public to inform the authorities of potentially unnecessary traffic cones, which was part of the Citizen's Charter project established by John Major.\n\n\"Private Eye\" parodied Sue Townsend's \"The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, age 13¾\" to write \"\", in which Major was portrayed as naïve and childish, keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his \"Bastards Book\", and featuring \"my wife Norman\" and \"Mr Dr Mawhinney\" as recurring characters. The magazine still runs one-off specials of this diary (with the age updated) on occasions when Major is in the news, such as on the breaking of the Edwina Currie story or the publication of his autobiography. The magazine also ran a series of cartoons called \"101 Uses for a John Major\" (based on a comic book of some ten years earlier, called \"101 Uses for a Dead Cat\"), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak. \n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"\n\nMajor was often mocked for his nostalgic evocation of what sounded like the lost Britain of the 1950s (see Merry England). For example: \"Fifty years on from now, Britain will still be the country of long shadows on cricket grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers\". Major complained in his memoirs that these words (which drew upon a passage in the sociopolitical commentator and author George Orwell's \"\") had been misrepresented as being more naive and romantic than he had intended, and indeed his memoirs were dismissive of the common conservative viewpoint that there was once a time of moral rectitude; Major wrote that \"life has never been as simple as that\".\n\nWriting in 2011 the BBC's Home editor Mark Easton judged that \"Majorism\" had made little lasting impact. Peter Oborne, writing in 2012, asserts that Major's government looks ever more successful as time goes by. Major was also one of the prime ministers portrayed in the 2013 stage play \"The Audience\", played by Paul Ritter.\n\nMajor married Norma Johnson (now Dame Norma Major) on 3 October 1970 at St Matthew's Church, Brixton. She was a teacher and a member of the Young Conservatives. They met on polling day for the Greater London Council elections in London, and became engaged after only ten days. They had two children; a son, James, and a daughter, Elizabeth. They have a holiday home on the coast of north Norfolk, near Weybourne, which has round-the-clock police surveillance.\n\nMajor's elder brother, Terry, who died in 2007, became a minor media personality during Major's period in Downing Street, with a 1994 autobiography, \"Major Major\". He also wrote newspaper columns, and appeared on TV shows such as \"Have I Got News for You\". He faced criticism about his brother but always remained loyal.\n\nSir John's daughter Elizabeth married Luke Salter on 26 March 2000, having been in a relationship since 1988. Salter died on 22 November 2002 from cancer.\n\nHis son James, a former nightclub promoter and flooring contractor, married gameshow hostess Emma Noble and they have a son, Harrison. Following their divorce, James married Kate Postlethwaite (née Dorrell), the mother of his second son, on 31 March 2012.\n\nResearch conducted by Paul Penn-Simkins, a genealogist formerly employed as a researcher at the College of Arms and as a heraldic consultant at Christie's, and subsequently corroborated by Lynda Rippin, a genealogist employed by Lincolnshire Council, showed that John Major and Margaret Thatcher were fifth cousins once removed, both descending from the Crust family, who farmed at Leake, near Boston, Lincolnshire.\n\nMajor is the Patron of British Gymnastics, as well as an enthusiastic follower of cricket and motor racing; he is also a supporter of Chelsea F.C.\n\nBULLET::::- Member of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council (1987)\nBULLET::::- Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (1999)\nBULLET::::- Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter (2005)\n\nIn the 1999 New Year Honours List, Major was made a Companion of Honour for his work on the Northern Ireland peace process. In a 2003 interview, he spoke about his hopes for peace in the region.\n\nOn 23 April 2005, Major was bestowed with a knighthood as a Companion of the Order of the Garter by Queen Elizabeth II. He was installed at St George's Chapel, Windsor on 13 June. Membership of the Order of the Garter is limited in number to 24, and as a personal gift of the Queen is an honour traditionally bestowed on former Prime Ministers. Major had previously declined a life peerage on standing down from Parliament.\n\nOn 20 June 2008, Major was granted the Freedom of the City of Cork.\n\nOn 26 April 2010, Major gave a speech in the Cambridge Union, after which he was granted honorary membership of the society.\n\nOn 8 May 2012, Major was personally decorated at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo by the Emperor of Japan with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in recognition of his invaluable contributions to Japan–UK relations through his work in the political and economic arena, and also in promoting mutual understanding. While Prime Minister, Major had pursued energetic campaigns aimed at boosting bilateral trade: \"Priority Japan\" (1991–94) and \"Action Japan\" (1994–97).

{"id": "15904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15904", "title": "Jazz dance", "text": "Jazz dance\n\nJazz dance is a performance dance technique and style that first emerged in Brazil in the early twentieth century. Jazz dance may refer to vernacular jazz or to Broadway or theatrical jazz. Both genres build on African American vernacular styles of dancing that emerged with jazz music. Vernacular jazz dance includes ragtime dances, Charleston, Lindy hop, and mambo. Popular vernacular jazz dance performers include The Whitman Sisters, Florence Mills, Ethel Waters, Al & Leon, Frankie Manning, Norma Miller, Dawn Hampton, and Katherine Dunham. Theatrical jazz dance performed on the concert stage was popularized by Jack Cole, Bob Fosse, Eugene Louis Faccuito, and Gus Giordano.\n\nThe term 'jazz dance' has been used in ways that have little or nothing to do with jazz music. Since the 1940s, Hollywood movies and Broadway shows have used the term to describe the choreographies of Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins. In the 1990s, colleges and universities applied to the term to classes offered by physical education departments in which students dance to various forms of pop music, rarely jazz.\n\nThe origin of jazz dance can be traced to African ritual and celebratory dances from around the seventeenth century. These dances emphasized polyrhythm and improvisation. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, the transatlantic slave trade brought ten million enslaved Africans to the Americas. By 1817 in New Orleans, city laws \"restricted gatherings of enslaved people to Sunday afternoons in Congo Square, known as Place Publique\".\n\nIn 1917, jazz pianist Spencer Williams wrote a song called \"Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble\" which inspired a jazz dance called the shimmy. The shimmy is done by holding the body still \"except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth\". The dances that emerged during this period were the Charleston and the Lindy hop.The Charleston is \"characterized by its toes-in, heels-out twisting steps\". It can be done as a solo or with any number of people.\n\nThe Lindy hop was a wild and spontaneous partner dance that was extremely rhythmically conscious. When the Great Depression began in October of 1929, many people turned to dance. Because of this, the Aubrielle and the Lindy hop are now considered to be under the umbrella term \"swing dance stylized, continuously flowing movements that developed the technique and style for the combinations that followed\". Cole's style has been called hip, hard, and cool\". Fosse combined \"vaudeville, striptease, magic shows, nightclubs, film and Broadway musicals\".\n\nContemporary jazz became well known because of shows like \"So You Think You Can Dance\". Mia Michaels's earlier work exemplifies this style. Some other companies and choreographers that create contemporary jazz dance are Sonya Tayeh, Mandy Moore, and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. Commercial jazz, which has been popular since the 1980s, combines aspects of hip hop and jazz and is often done to pop music. This style can be seen in the music videos of Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul. Commercial jazz often includes more \"tricks.\" Commercial jazz and contemporary jazz are both seen at dance competitions. Another variety of jazz is Latin jazz. \"Maria Torres developed and popularized the fusion at Broadway Dance Center\". Latin jazz has an emphasis on the movement of hips and isolations. It can be seen in the films \"El Cantante\" and \"Dance with Me\", as well as on TV dance shows.\n\nBULLET::::- Jack Cole influenced Matt Mattox, Bob Fosse, Jerome Robbins, and Gwen Verdon, and is credited with popularizing the theatrical form of jazz dance with his great number of choreographic works on television and Broadway.\nBULLET::::- Katherine Dunham is an anthropologist, choreographer, and pioneer in black theatrical dance who introduced isolations jazz dance.\nBULLET::::- Eugene Louis Faccuito also known as Luigi, was an American jazz dancer, teacherm choreographer, and creator of the first codified jazz technique, the Luigi Technique.\nBULLET::::- Bob Fosse, choreographer and film director, revolutionized jazz dance with his sexually suggestive movements.

{"id": "15907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15907", "title": "Jabberwocky", "text": "Jabberwocky\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll about the killing of a creature named \"the Jabberwock\". It was included in his 1871 novel \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\", the sequel to \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The book tells of Alice's adventures within the back-to-front world of Looking-Glass Land.\n\nIn an early scene in which she first encounters the chess piece characters White King and White Queen, Alice finds a book written in a seemingly unintelligible language. Realizing that she is travelling through an inverted world, she recognises that the verses on the pages are written in mirror-writing. She holds a mirror to one of the poems and reads the reflected verse of \"Jabberwocky\". She finds the nonsense verse as puzzling as the odd land she has passed into, later revealed as a dreamscape.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is considered one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has given English nonsense words and neologisms such as \"galumphing\" and \"chortle\".\n\nA decade before the publication of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and the sequel \"Through the Looking-Glass\", Carroll wrote the first stanza to what would become \"Jabberwocky\" while in Croft on Tees, close to Darlington, where he lived as a child. It was printed in 1855 in \"Mischmasch\", a periodical he wrote and illustrated for the amusement of his family. The piece was titled \"Stanza of Anglo-Saxon Poetry\" and read:\n\n<poem>\nTwas bryllyg, and \"y\" slythy toves\nDid gyre and gymble in \"y\" wabe:\nAll mimsy were \"y\" borogoves;\nAnd \"y\" mome raths outgrabe.\n</poem>\n\nCarroll wrote the letter-combination \"y\" throughout the poem for the word \"the\" in order to approximate the Middle and Early Modern English scribal abbreviation - a variant of the letter Þ (thorn) in combination with the superscript E. The poem was printed first in mock-mediaeval lettering as a \"relic of ancient Poetry\" and printed again beneath \"in modern characters\".\n\nThe rest of the poem was written during Carroll's stay with relatives at Whitburn, near Sunderland. The story may have been partly inspired by the local Sunderland area legend of the Lambton Worm, and the tale of the Sockburn Worm while writing in Croft on Tees and Whitburn in Sockburn.\n\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll, who would have known of chapbooks such as \"The World Turned Upside Down\" and stories such as \"The Great Panjandrum\". Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well-known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or \"lügenmärchen\". Roger Lancelyn Green suggests that \"Jabberwocky\" is a parody of the old German ballad \"The Shepherd of the Giant Mountains\" in which a shepherd kills a griffin that is attacking his sheep. The ballad had been translated into English in blank verse by Carroll's cousin Menella Bute Smedley in 1846, many years before the appearance of the Alice books. Historian Sean B. Palmer suggests that Carroll was inspired by a section from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", citing the lines: \"The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead/Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets\" from Act I, Scene i.\nJohn Tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871, and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem. The illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the contemporary Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology. Stephen Prickett notes that in the context of Darwin and Mantell's publications and vast exhibitions of dinosaurs, such as those at the Crystal Palace from 1854, it is unsurprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long scaly neck and tail of a sauropod.\"\n\nMany of the words in the poem are playful nonce words of Carroll's own invention, without intended explicit meaning. When Alice has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions:\n\n\"It seems very pretty,\" she said when she had finished it, \"but it's rather hard to understand!\" (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) \"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate.\"\n\nThis may reflect Carroll's intention for his readership; the poem is, after all, part of a dream. In later writings he discussed some of his lexicon, commenting that he did not know the specific meanings or sources of some of the words; the linguistic ambiguity and uncertainty throughout both the book and the poem may largely be the point.\n\nIn \"Through the Looking-Glass\", the character of Humpty Dumpty, in response to Alice's request, explains to her the non-sense words from the first stanza of the poem; however, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. For example, following the poem, a \"rath\" is described by Humpty as \"a sort of green pig\". Carroll's notes for the original in \"Mischmasch\" suggest a \"rath\" is \"a species of Badger\" that \"lived chiefly on cheese\" and had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag. The appendices to certain \"Looking Glass\" editions, however, state that the creature is \"a species of land turtle\" that lived on swallows and oysters. Later critics added their own interpretations of the lexicon, often without reference to Carroll's own contextual commentary. An extended analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book \"The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner.\n\nIn 1868 Carroll asked his publishers, Macmillan, \"Have you any means, or can you find any, for printing a page or two in the next volume of Alice in reverse?\" It may be that Carroll was wanting to print the whole poem in mirror writing. Macmillan responded that it would cost a great deal more to do, and this may have dissuaded him.\n\nIn the author's note to the Christmas 1896 edition of \"Through the Looking-Glass\" Carroll writes, \"The new words, in the poem Jabberwocky, have given rise to some differences of opinion as to their pronunciation, so it may be well to give instructions on \"that\" point also. Pronounce 'slithy' as if it were the two words, 'sly, thee': make the 'g' \"hard\" in 'gyre' and 'gimble': and pronounce 'rath' to rhyme with 'bath.'\"\n\nIn the Preface to \"The Hunting of the Snark\", Carroll wrote, \"[Let] me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce \"slithy toves.\" The \"i\" in \"slithy\" is long, as in \"writhe\", and \"toves\" is pronounced so as to rhyme with \"groves.\" Again, the first \"o\" in \"borogoves\" is pronounced like the \"o\" in \"borrow.\" I have heard people try to give it the sound of the \"o\" in \"worry.\" Such is Human Perversity.\"\n\nBULLET::::- Bandersnatch: A swift moving creature with snapping jaws, capable of extending its neck. A 'bander' was also an archaic word for a 'leader', suggesting that a 'bandersnatch' might be an animal that hunts the leader of a group.\nBULLET::::- Beamish: Radiantly beaming, happy, cheerful. Although Carroll may have believed he had coined this word, usage in 1530 is cited in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nBULLET::::- Borogove: Following the poem Humpty Dumpty says: \" 'borogove' is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round, something like a live mop.\" In \"Mischmasch\" borogoves are described differently: \"An extinct kind of Parrot. They had no wings, beaks turned up, and made their nests under sun-dials: lived on veal.\" In \"Hunting of the Snark\", Carroll says that the initial syllable of \"borogove\" is pronounced as in \"borrow\" rather than as in \"worry\".\nBULLET::::- Brillig: Following the poem, the character of Humpty Dumpty comments: \" 'Brillig' means four o'clock in the afternoon, the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.\" According to \"Mischmasch\", it is derived from the verb to \"bryl\" or \"broil\".\nBULLET::::- Burbled: In a letter of December 1877, Carroll notes that \"burble\" could be a mixture of the three verbs 'bleat', 'murmur', and 'warble', although he did not remember creating it.\nBULLET::::- Chortled: \"Combination of 'chuckle' and 'snort'.\" (OED)\nBULLET::::- Frabjous: Possibly a blend of \"fair\", \"fabulous\", and \"joyous\". Definition from \"Oxford English Dictionary\", credited to Lewis Carroll.\nBULLET::::- Frumious: Combination of \"fuming\" and \"furious\". In the Preface to \"The Hunting of the Snark\" Carroll comments, \"[T]ake the two words 'fuming' and 'furious'. Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'.\"\nBULLET::::- Galumphing: Perhaps used in the poem as a blend of 'gallop' and 'triumphant'. Used later by Kipling, and cited by Webster as \"To move with a clumsy and heavy tread\"\nBULLET::::- Gimble: Humpty comments that it means: \"to make holes like a gimlet.\"\nBULLET::::- Gyre: \"To 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope.\" \"Gyre\" is entered in the OED from 1420, meaning a circular or spiral motion or form; especially a giant circular oceanic surface current. However, Carroll also wrote in \"Mischmasch\" that it meant to scratch like a dog. The \"g\" is pronounced like the /g/ in \"gold\", not like \"gem\" (since this was how \"gyroscope\" was pronounced in Carroll's day).\nBULLET::::- Jabberwock: When a class in the Girls' Latin School in Boston asked Carroll's permission to name their school magazine \"The Jabberwock\", he replied: \"The Anglo-Saxon word 'wocer' or 'wocor' signifies 'offspring' or 'fruit'. Taking 'jabber' in its ordinary acceptation of 'excited and voluble discussion', this would give the meaning of 'the result of much excited and voluble discussion'...\" It is often depicted as a monster similar to a dragon. In the above old image it has four legs and also bat-like wings. In \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010 film) it is shown with large back legs, small dinosaur-like front legs, and on the ground it uses its wings as front legs like a pterosaur, and it breathes out lightning flashes rather than flame.\nBULLET::::- Jubjub bird: 'A desperate bird that lives in perpetual passion', according to the Butcher in Carroll's later poem \"The Hunting of the Snark\". 'Jub' is an ancient word for a jerkin or a dialect word for the trot of a horse (OED). It might make reference to the call of the bird resembling the sound \"jub, jub\".\nBULLET::::- Manxome: Possibly 'fearsome'; Possibly a portmanteau of \"manly\" and \"buxom\", the latter relating to men for most of its history; or \"three-legged\" after the Triskelion emblem of the Manx people from the Isle of Man.\nBULLET::::- Mimsy: Humpty comments that \" 'Mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' \".\nBULLET::::- Mome: Humpty Dumpty is uncertain about this one: \"I think it's short for 'from home', meaning that they'd lost their way, you know\". The notes in \"Mischmasch\" give a different definition of 'grave' (via 'solemome', 'solemone' and 'solemn').\nBULLET::::- Outgrabe: Humpty says \" 'outgribing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle\". Carroll's book appendices suggest it is the past tense of the verb to 'outgribe', connected with the old verb to 'grike' or 'shrike', which derived 'shriek' and 'creak' and hence 'squeak'.\nBULLET::::- Rath: Humpty Dumpty says following the poem: \"A 'rath' is a sort of green pig\". Carroll's notes for the original in \"Mischmasch\" state that a 'Rath' is \"a species of land turtle. Head erect, mouth like a shark, the front forelegs curved out so that the animal walked on its knees, smooth green body, lived on swallows and oysters.\" In the 1951 animated film adaptation of the previous book, the raths are depicted as small, multi-coloured creatures with tufty hair, round eyes, and long legs resembling pipe stems.\nBULLET::::- Slithy: Humpty Dumpty says: \" 'Slithy' means 'lithe and slimy'. 'Lithe' is the same as 'active'. You see it's like a portmanteau, there are two meanings packed up into one word.\" The original in \"Mischmasch\" notes that 'slithy' means \"smooth and active\" The \"i\" is long, as in \"writhe\".\nBULLET::::- Snicker-snack: possibly related to the large knife, the snickersnee.\nBULLET::::- Tove: Humpty Dumpty says \" 'Toves' are something like badgers, they're something like lizards, and they're something like corkscrews. [...] Also they make their nests under sun-dials, also they live on cheese.\" Pronounced so as to rhyme with \"groves\". They \"gyre and gimble,\" i.e., rotate and bore. Toves are described slightly differently in \"Mischmasch\": \"a species of Badger [which] had smooth white hair, long hind legs, and short horns like a stag [and] lived chiefly on cheese\".\nBULLET::::- Tulgey: Carroll himself said he could give no source for Tulgey. Could be taken to mean thick, dense, dark. It has been suggested that it comes from the Anglo-Cornish word \"Tulgu\", 'darkness', which in turn comes from the Cornish language \"Tewolgow\" 'darkness, gloominess'.\nBULLET::::- Uffish: Carroll noted \"It seemed to suggest a state of mind when the voice is gruffish, the manner roughish, and the temper huffish\".\nBULLET::::- Vorpal: Carroll said he could not explain this word, though it has been noted that it can be formed by taking letters alternately from \"verbal\" and \"gospel\".\nBULLET::::- Wabe: The characters in the poem suggest it means \"The grass plot around a sundial\", called a 'wa-be' because it \"goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it\". In the original \"Mischmasch\" text, Carroll states a 'wabe' is \"the side of a hill (from its being soaked by rain)\".\n\nThough the poem contains many nonsensical words, English syntax and poetic forms are observed, such as the quatrain verses, the general ABAB rhyme scheme and the iambic meter. Linguist Peter Lucas believes the \"nonsense\" term is inaccurate. The poem relies on a distortion of sense rather than \"non-sense\", allowing the reader to infer meaning and therefore engage with narrative while lexical allusions swim under the surface of the poem.\n\nMarnie Parsons describes the work as a \"semiotic catastrophe\", arguing that the words create a discernible narrative within the structure of the poem, though the reader cannot know what they symbolise. She argues that Humpty tries, after the recitation, to \"ground\" the unruly multiplicities of meaning with definitions, but cannot succeed as both the book and the poem are playgrounds for the \"carnivalised aspect of language\". Parsons suggests that this is mirrored in the prosody of the poem: in the tussle between the tetrameter in the first three lines of each stanza and trimeter in the last lines, such that one undercuts the other and we are left off balance, like the poem's hero.\n\nCarroll wrote many poem parodies such as \"Twinkle, twinkle little bat\", \"You Are Old, Father William\" and \"How Doth the Little Crocodile?\" Some have become generally better known than the originals on which they are based, and this is certainly the case with \"Jabberwocky\". The poems' successes do not rely on any recognition or association of the poems that they parody. Lucas suggests that the original poems provide a strong container but Carroll's works are famous precisely because of their random, surreal quality. Carroll's grave playfulness has been compared with that of the poet Edward Lear; there are also parallels with the work of Gerard Manley Hopkins in the frequent use of soundplay, alliteration, created-language and portmanteau. Both writers were Carroll's contemporaries.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" has been translated into numerous languages, as the novel has been translated into 65 languages. The translation might be difficult because the poem holds to English syntax and many of the principal words of the poem are invented. Translators have generally dealt with them by creating equivalent words of their own. Often these are similar in spelling or sound to Carroll's while respecting the morphology of the language they are being translated into. In Frank L. Warrin's French translation, \"'Twas brillig\" becomes \"Il brilgue\". In instances like this, both the original and the invented words echo actual words of Carroll's lexicon, but not necessarily ones with similar meanings. Translators have invented words which draw on root words with meanings similar to the English roots used by Carroll. Douglas Hofstadter noted in his essay \"Translations of Jabberwocky\", the word 'slithy', for example, echoes the English 'slimy', 'slither', 'slippery', 'lithe' and 'sly'. A French translation that uses 'lubricilleux' for 'slithy', evokes French words like 'lubrifier' (to lubricate) to give an impression of a meaning similar to that of Carroll's word. In his exploration of the translation challenge, Hofstadter asks \"what if a word does exist, but it is very intellectual-sounding and Latinate ('lubricilleux'), rather than earthy and Anglo-Saxon ('slithy')? Perhaps 'huilasse' would be better than 'lubricilleux'? Or does the Latin origin of the word 'lubricilleux' not make itself felt to a speaker of French in the way that it would if it were an English word ('lubricilious', perhaps)? \".\n\nHofstadter also notes that it makes a great difference whether the poem is translated in isolation or as part of a translation of the novel. In the latter case the translator must, through Humpty Dumpty, supply explanations of the invented words. But, he suggests, \"even in this pathologically difficult case of translation, there seems to be some rough equivalence obtainable, a kind of rough isomorphism, partly global, partly local, between the brains of all the readers\".\n\nIn 1967, D.G. Orlovskaya wrote a popular Russian translation of \"Jabberwocky\" entitled \"Barmaglot\" (\"Бармаглот\"). She translated \"Barmaglot\" for \"Jabberwock\", \"Brandashmyg\" for \"Bandersnatch\" while \"myumsiki\" (\"мюмзики\") echoes \"mimsy\". Full translations of \"Jabberwocky\" into French and German can be found in \"The Annotated Alice\" along with a discussion of why some translation decisions were made. Chao Yuen Ren, a Chinese linguist, translated the poem into Chinese by inventing characters to imitate what Rob Gifford of National Public Radio refers to as the \"slithy toves that gyred and gimbled in the wabe of Carroll's original\". Satyajit Ray, a film-maker, translated the work into Bengali and concrete poet Augusto de Campos created a Brazilian Portuguese version. There is also an Arabic translation by Wael Al-Mahdi, and at least two into Croatian Language. Multiple translations into Latin were made within the first weeks of Carroll's original publication. In a 1964 article, M. L. West published two versions of the poem in Ancient Greek that exemplify the respective styles of the epic poets Homer and Nonnus.\n\nSources:\n\nscope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"Bulgarian(Lazar Goldman & Stefan Gechev)\nscope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"Danish 1(Mogens Jermiin Nissen)Jabberwocky\nscope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\"Danish 2(Arne Herløv Petersen)Kloppervok\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nEsperanto (Marjorie Boulton)La Ĵargonbesto\nTurkish (Nihal Yeğinobalı)Ejdercenkname\nFinnish 1(Kirsi Kunnas & Eeva-Liisa Manner, 1974)Pekoraali\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nstyle=\"vertical-align: top;\"\nFinnish 2(Matti Rosvall, 1999)Jabberwocky\nFinnish 3(Alice Martin, 2010)Monkerias\nFrench(Frank L.

(Performed in 1994)\n\nAccording to Chesterton and Green and others, the original purpose of \"Jabberwocky\" was to satirise both pretentious verse and ignorant literary critics. It was designed as verse showing how not to write verse, but eventually became the subject of pedestrian translation or explanation and incorporated into classroom learning. It has also been interpreted as a parody of contemporary Oxford scholarship and specifically the story of how Benjamin Jowett, the notoriously agnostic Professor of Greek at Oxford, and Master of Balliol, came to sign the \"Thirty-Nine Articles\", as an Anglican statement of faith, to save his job. The transformation of audience perception from satire to seriousness was in a large part predicted by G. K. Chesterton, who wrote in 1932, \"Poor, poor, little Alice! She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others.\"\n\nIt is often now cited as one of the greatest nonsense poems written in the English language, the source for countless parodies and tributes. In most cases the writers have changed the nonsense words into words relating to the parodied subject, as in Frank Jacobs's \"If Lewis Carroll Were a Hollywood Press Agent in the Thirties\" in \"Mad for Better or Verse\". Other writers use the poem as a form, much like a sonnet, and create their own words for it as in \"Strunklemiss\" by Shay K. Azoulay or the poem \"Oh Freddled Gruntbuggly\" recited by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz in Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", a 1979 book which contains numerous other references and homages to Carroll's work.\n\n<poem>\nOh freddled gruntbuggly thy micturations are to me\nAs plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\nGroop I implore thee my foonting turlingdromes\nAnd hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,\nOr I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my\nblurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\n</poem>\n\nSome of the words that Carroll created, such as \"chortled\" and \"galumphing\", have entered the English language and are listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". The word \"jabberwocky\" itself has come to refer to nonsense language.\n\nIn American Sign Language, Eric Malzkuhn invented the sign for \"chortled\" and it subsequently, and unintentionally, caught on and became a part of American Sign Language's lexicon as well.\n\nA song called \"Beware the Jabberwock\" was written for Disney's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951). The British group Boeing Duveen and The Beautiful Soup released a single (1968) called \"Jabberwock\" based on the poem.\n\nThe poem was a source of inspiration for Jan Švankmajer's 1971 short film \"Jabberwocky\", and Terry Gilliam's 1977 film of the same name. In 1972, the American composer Sam Pottle put the poem to music. The stage musical \"Jabberwocky\" (1973) by Andrew Kay, Malcolm Middleton and Peter Phillips, follows the basic plot of the poem.\n\nThe Jabberwock (mis-named as \"The Jabberwocky\") is a central character in Tim Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), voiced by Christopher Lee. An abridged version of the poem is spoken by the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp).\n\nIrish singer and songwriter Donovan has put the poem to music on his album ′HMS Donovan′ (1971).\n\nBULLET::::- Works based on \"Alice in Wonderland\"\nBULLET::::- Translations of \"Through the Looking-Glass\"\n\nBULLET::::- Carpenter, Humphrey (1985). \"Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children's Literature\".

{"id": "15908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15908", "title": "John Sparrow David Thompson", "text": "John Sparrow David Thompson\n\nSir John Sparrow David Thompson (November 10, 1845 – December 12, 1894) was a Canadian lawyer, judge, and politician who served as the fourth prime minister of Canada, in office from 1892 until his death. He had previously been premier of Nova Scotia for a brief period in 1882.\n\nThompson was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He trained as a lawyer, and was called to the bar in 1865. Thompson was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1877 as a representative of the Conservative Party. He became the provincial attorney general the following year, in Simon Holmes' government, replaced Holmes as premier in 1882. However, he served for only two months before losing the 1882 general election to the Liberal Party. After losing the premiership, he accepted an appointment to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1885, Thompson entered federal politics at the personal request of Sir John A. Macdonald, becoming Minister of Justice. In that role he was the driving force behind the enactment of the Canadian Criminal Code. Thompson became prime minister in 1892, following the retirement of John Abbott. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the position. On a trip to England in 1894, Thompson unexpectedly suffered a heart attack and died, aged 49. He is the second and most recent Canadian prime minister to have died in office, after Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nBorn in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to John Sparrow Thompson and Charlotte Pottinger, he was of Irish descent. Some sources say he was born on November 10, 1845, though others say 1844. Thompson married Annie Affleck (1842–1913) in 1870. Annie Thompson was strong-willed and had the same kind of spirit that had driven Agnes Macdonald (another prime minister's wife) to ride the cowcatcher of a Canadian Pacific Railway train through the British Columbia mountains. During their courtship, Thompson was forced to write love letters in shorthand because of his soon-to-be wife's disapproving parents. A daughter, Annie, died at 1, while youngest son David lived to be 2. Two other children died at birth, the Thompsons had five children survive childhood.\n\nThompson was called to the Nova Scotia Bar in July 1865, and from 1878 to 1882, he served as Attorney General in the provincial government of Simon H. Holmes. He briefly held the office of Nova Scotia premier in 1882, but his government was defeated in that year's election. Thompson was always a reluctant politician.\n\nAfter his resignation from government, Thompson was immediately appointed to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court by the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald. In this role, he was instrumental in founding the Dalhousie Law School in 1883. He taught law courses at Dalhousie in its early years.\n\nAfter several failed overtures, John A. Macdonald finally recruited Thompson to Ottawa in 1885. Macdonald generally thought highly of Thompson, remarking, \"My one great discovery was my discovery of Thompson\". Macdonald poked some fun at his recruit as well: \"Thompson is a little too fond of satire, and a little too much of a Nova Scotian.\" However, his rise in government was probably because of the influence of Lady Aberdeen, the wife of Governor General Aberdeen and Macdonald's mentoring. She had great admiration for Thompson and wrote frequently about him in her \"Canadian Journal\".\n\nThompson was sworn in as Minister of Justice in September 1885 and won a seat in Parliament in October, representing Antigonish.\n\nWhen he returned to Ottawa, the Louis Riel crisis was in full swing. The question of what to do with Louis Riel, who had been sentenced to hang for leading the 1885 North-West Rebellion, was now the responsibility of Thompson. Although Thompson was ill with kidney stones at the time of Riel's execution, Thompson made his first major speech to Parliament during the subsequent debate by arguing that anyone who encouraged Canadians to act against the state could not escape justice. The speech was notable and helped to popularize Thompson, and he quickly rose to become a leading member of the Conservative government.\n\nHis achievements as Minister of Justice included the first \"Criminal Code\", a consolidation and unification of the criminal law for Canada.\n\nThompson was the last minister to see Macdonald before his devastating stroke in May 1891. Following Macdonald's death a week later, there was a Cabinet crisis. The governor-general, Lord Stanley of Preston, requested for Thompson to form a government, but Thompson declined because of religious prejudice against the Roman Catholicism to which he had converted at his marriage. Thompson recommended John Abbott, who ultimately accepted.\n\nThompson assumed the office of Prime Minister in 1892, a year later, when Sir John Abbott retired. Thompson retained the post of Attorney General while he was prime minister.\n\nHe came very close to bringing Newfoundland into Confederation, but that would not be achieved until 1949.\n\nHis first major speech as Prime Minister was given in Toronto in January 1893 and covered the topics of tolerance and Canadian nationalism in conjunction with loyalty to the British crown. At the time, Thompson was concerned about the possibility of the annexation of Canada by the United States, a goal that was being pursued within Canada by the Continental Union Association, a group of Ontario and Quebec Liberals. Despite his concern, Thompson ultimately realized that the conspiracy to make Canada part of the United States was confined to a small and noisy minority within the opposition party.\n\nIn March 1893, Thompson travelled to Paris, France as one of the judges on the tribunal to settle the dispute over the seal harvest in the Bering Sea. The tribunal ruled there was no justification for the American claim that the Bering Sea was closed to all but American seal hunters.\n\nOther matters of concern during Thompson's tenure as Prime Minister included the reduction of trade tariffs and questions over schooling in Manitoba and in the North West Territories, where serious disputes existed over the role of Catholics and Protestants in administering the school system. The issue in the North West Territories would be resolved to Thompson's satisfaction but only after his death.\n\nWhile in office, Thompson chose the following jurists to sit as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada:\nBULLET::::- Sir Samuel Henry Strong (as Chief Justice, December 13, 1892 – November 18, 1902; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister Mackenzie, September 30, 1875)\nBULLET::::- Robert Sedgewick – (February 18, 1893 – August 4, 1906)\nBULLET::::- George Edwin King – (September 21, 1893 – May 8, 1901)\n\nSir John Thompson had been Prime Minister of Canada for only two years when he died suddenly from a heart attack at the age of 49 on December 12, 1894. He was at England's Windsor Castle, where Queen Victoria had just made him a member of her Privy Council. Thompson's physical condition had deteriorated during his time in Ottawa; he was significantly overweight when he died (standing , he weighed about ), and had always pushed himself very hard in his work.\n\nThompson was the second of two Canadian prime ministers to die in office (the first being Sir John A. Macdonald), and the first of three who did not die in Canada (the other two being Sir Charles Tupper and R. B. Bennett).\n\nAfter an elaborate funeral was staged for him in the United Kingdom by Queen Victoria, Thompson's remains were transported back to Canada aboard the armoured cruiser , which was painted black for the occasion. He was buried on January 3, 1895, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nDespite having held prime ministerial office, Thompson had little estate, so Parliament set up a fund to support his widow and children. The Canadian politician Margaret Mitchell, who died March 8, 2017, is considered the last of Thompson's descendants.\n\nThompson, then a young barrister, married in 1870 Annie E. Affleck, daughter of John Affleck, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and his wife, Catherine Saunders. Annie was born and educated in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The couple had nine children, only five of whom survived early childhood. After she was widowed December 12, 1894, a fund of $30,000 was raised for Lady Thompson, headed by Lord Strathcona with a subscription of $5,000; the Parliament of Canada contributed $25,000. The Governor-General, the Earl of Aberdeen undertook the education of the sons. Lady Thompson cofounded, with the Countess of Aberdeen, the National Council of Women, and served as one of its presidents. She served as a governor of the Victorian Order of Nurses. As a widow, she lived at Derwent Lodge, 631 Sherbourne Street in Toronto.\n\nThompson was designated a Person of National Historic Significance in 1937. His collected papers were donated in 1949 to the National Archives of Canada by his son, Colonel John Thompson.\n\nAlthough subjective, a ranking of the Canadian Prime Ministers was published by J.L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in 1997. A survey of 26 Canadian historians determined that Thompson was ranked #10 of the 20 people who had at that time served as Canadian PM. He was identified as \"The great \"might-have-been\" of Canadian Prime Ministers...\", whose potentially promising career was cut short by his early death. A follow-up article co-authored by Hillmer in 2011 broadened the survey to include survey responses of over 100 historians; in this survey, Thompson was ranked 14th out the 22 who had by then served as PM.\n\nThe high school in the Canadian sitcom Life with Derek, SJST, is named after Thompson. Sir John Thompson Catholic Junior High School in Edmonton is named for him. Thompson appears as a prominent character in Paul Marlowe's novel \"Knights of the Sea\" (set in 1887 when Thompson was Minister of Justice).\n\nSince 1996, Sir John Thompson's former home in Ottawa at 237 Metcalfe Street has served as the national office of the Canadian Soccer Association.\n\nNova Scotian artist William Valentine painted Thompson's portrait.\n\nBULLET::::- List of Canadian Prime Ministers\nBULLET::::- List of books about Prime Ministers of Canada\n\nBULLET::::- J.

{"id": "15910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15910", "title": "List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach", "text": "List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach composed cantatas, motets, masses, Magnificats, Passions, oratorios, four-part chorales, songs and arias. His instrumental music includes concertos, suites, sonatas, fugues, and other works for organ, harpsichord, lute, violin, cello, flute, chamber ensemble and orchestra.\n\nThere are over 1000 known compositions by Bach. Nearly all of them are listed in the \"\" (BWV), which is the best known and most widely used catalogue of Bach's compositions.\nThe earliest lists of Bach's compositions are given by his biographers, starting from his obituary which gives a list of instrumental works printed during the composer's lifetime (from Clavier-Übung I to \"The Art of Fugue\"), followed by a list which groups other types of compositions he wrote. The , by Johann Nikolaus Forkel, follows the same setup: its ninth chapter first lists printed works (adding four-part chorales that were published in the second half of the 18th century), followed by a rough overview of the unpublished ones. In the first half of the 19th century more works were published, so the next biographies (Schauer and Hilgenfeldt in 1850) had more elaborate appendices listing printed works, referring to these works by publisher, and the number or page number given to the works in these publications. So, for example, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major can be indicated as \"C. F. Peters Vol. III No. 1\", or any of the variants (\"Griepenkerl and Roitzsch Vol. 3 p. 2\", \"Peters Book 242 p. 2\", \"P. S. V., Cah. 3 (242), No. 1\", etc.)\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century the Bach-Gesellschaft (BG) published all of Bach's works in around 50 volumes, the so-called Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA). This offered a unique identification of all of Bach's known works, a system that was quickly adopted, for instance by the biographers: Philipp Spitta used it complementarily to the Peters edition numbering for the BG volumes that had appeared when he was writing his Bach-biography in the second half of the 19th century (e.g. \"B. G., III., p. 173\" for the above-mentioned Prelude in E-flat major), and Terry used it in the third Appendix to his 20th-century translation of Forkel's biography.\n\nBut there was still a lot of confusion: some authors preferred to list Bach's works according to Novello's editions, or Augener's, or Schirmer's... giving rise to various conversion tables at the end of books on Bach's compositions (e.g. Harvey Grace's in a 1922 book on Bach's organ compositions).\n\nIn 1900 the BG published its last volume, and dissolved itself, as its primary goal, publishing all of Bach's known works, was accomplished. The BG was succeeded by the Neue Bachgesellschaft (NBG), with a new set of goals (Bach yearbook, Bach festivals, and a Bach museum). Occasionally however the NBG published newly discovered works, or variants not published in the BGA. For instance the 1740s version of \"O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht\" was published in NBG XVII in 1916 (the 1730s version of the same piece, with a different orchestration, had been published in BG 24, pp. 185–192).\n\nIn 1950 the \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\" was published, allocating a unique number to every known composition by Bach. Wolfgang Schmieder, the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following BG for the collation (e.g. BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):\n\nBULLET::::1. Kantaten (Cantatas), BWV 1–224\nBULLET::::2. Motetten (Motets), BWV 225–231\nBULLET::::3. Messen, Messensätze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat), BWV 232–243\nBULLET::::4. Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios), BWV 244–249\nBULLET::::5. Vierstimmige Choräle (Four-part chorales), BWV 250–438\nBULLET::::6. Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet), BWV 439–524\nBULLET::::7. Werke für Orgel (Works for organ), BWV 525–771\nBULLET::::8. Werke für Klavier (Keyboard compositions), BWV 772–994\nBULLET::::9. Werke für Laute (Lute compositions), BWV 995–1000\nBULLET::::10. Kammermusik (Chamber music), BWV 1001–1040\nBULLET::::11. Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra), BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041–1065) and Overtures (BWV 1066–1071)\nBULLET::::12. Kanons (Canons), BWV 1072–1078\nBULLET::::13. Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue), BWV 1079–1080\n\nFor instance, the Prelude and Fugue in E-flat major now became BWV 552, situated in the range of the works for organ. In contrast to other catalogues such as the Köchel catalogue for Mozart's compositions there is no attempt at chronological organization in the BWV numbering, for instance BWV 992 is an early composition by Bach. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S. 225 = BWV 225).\n\nAnother consequence of the ordering principles of the BWV was that it tore known collections apart, for instance Clavier-Übung III was partly in the organ compositions range (BWV 552 and 669–689), with the four duets listed among the keyboard compositions (BWV 802–805).\n\nThe Anhang (Anh.), i.e. Appendix, of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:\nBULLET::::- I – lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived (Anh. 1–23)\nBULLET::::- II – works of dubious authenticity (Anh. 24–155)\nBULLET::::- III – works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him (Anh. 156–189)\nWithin each section of the Anhang the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.\n\nSchmieder published the BWV's second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the Anhang. A strict numerical collation was abandoned to insert additions, or when for another reason compositions were regrouped. For example, BWV 11, formerly listed as a Cantata, was moved to the fourth chapter of the main catalogue as an Oratorio. Rather than renumbering a composition, an arrow indicated where the composition was inserted: \"\" meaning \"BWV 11, inserted after BWV 249b\" (4th chapter). Similarly, meant BWV 1083, inserted after BWV 243a (3rd chapter). Also authenticity discriminations, based on new research, could lead to such repositionings within the catalogue, e.g. \"\" became \" indicating it was now considered a spurious work.\n\nIn 1998 Alfred Dürr and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.\n\nNew additions (Nachträge) to BWV/BWV included:\nBULLET::::- BWV 1081–1126\nBULLET::::- BWV Anh. 190–213\n\nA few exceptions to the principle that compositions weren't renumbered were when a composition from the Anhang could be recovered and/or authenticated as Bach's, so that it deserved a place in the main catalogue, in which case it was given a number above 1080. So, for example, BWV Anh. 205 (BWV) → BWV 1121 (BWV, where it is in section 7 as a work for organ).\n\nOther renumberings and additional numbers involved alternative or earlier versions of basically the same composition, which were indicated by adding a lower case letter to the BWV number. Examples:\nBULLET::::- BWV 243a: 1723 E major version of the 1733 Magnificat in D major BWV 243\nBULLET::::- BWV 1071 renumbered to BWV 1046a (early version of the first \"Brandenburg Concerto\")\nBULLET::::- BWV Anh. 198 renumbered to BWV 149/1a (earlier abandoned version of the opening movement of Cantata BWV 149)\n\nSome versions were completely removed from the catalogue, e.g. BWV 655b and c\n\nSlashes indicate movements: e.g. BWV 149/1 indicates the first movement of the Cantata BWV 149. Another example: the Agnus Dei of the Mass in B minor can be indicated as BWV 232/22 (22nd movement of the composition), or alternatively as BWV 232/4 (BWV 232, fourth movement of Part IV).\n\nNumbers above BWV 1126 were added in the 21st century.\n\nAn upper case R added to a BWV number indicates a reconstructed version, that is a conjectured earlier version of a known composition. One of such reconstructions, the Concerto for oboe and violin, as published in NBA VII/7 (Supplement) p. 75, based on the double harpsichord concerto BWV 1060, is known as BWV 1060R.\n\nAs of mid-2018 the Bach digital website started to implement the new numbers of the 3rd edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, which had been announced for publication in that year. For example, the Leipzig version of the \"Christ lag in Todes Banden\" cantata used to be BWV 4 in previous versions of the catalogue, and, in BWV, has become BWV 4.2.\n\nIn the meantime, the New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, abbreviated as NBA) was being published, offering a new system to refer to Bach's works, e.g. , which is Series IV, Volume 4, p. 2 (Prelude) and p. 105 (Fugue), for BWV 552.\n\nSome years after the completion of the NBA in 2007 its publisher Bärenreiter joined with the Bach Archive again to publish revised editions of some of Bach's scores. These revised editions, aligning with the NBA editions (format, layout), but outside that group of publications, were published under the name Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works – Revised Edition (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke – Revidierte Edition), in short: New Bach Edition – Revised (Neue Bach-Ausgabe – Revidierte Edition), abbreviated as NBArev. Where the original NBA editions were exclusively in German, the volumes of the Revised series have their introductions both in German and English. Its first volume, NBArev 1, was a new edition of the Mass in B minor, appearing in 2010.\n\nThe Bach Compendium (BC), a catalogue covering Bach's vocal works, was published in 1985. Occasionally works that have no BWV number can be identified by their BC number, e.g. BC C 8 for \"Der Gerechte kömmt um\" an arrangement attributed to Bach on stylistic grounds, however unmentioned in the BWV.\n\nBachs Notenbibliothek (BNB) is a list of works Bach had at his disposition. Works of other composers which were arranged by Bach and/or which he (had) copied for performance usually have a BNB number.\n\nThe Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin = SBB) holds an important collection of composition manuscripts relating to Bach. Some versions of works are best known by their principal manuscript in the SBB, for instance = , or according to the abbreviations used at the Bach-digital website .\n\nApart from indicating his first published keyboard composition as Opus 1, Bach didn't use opus numbers, so Bach's works can't be listed by opus number. Lists following publication chronologies are for example implied in the first list in Bach's obituary, and BG numbers (within the BGA sequence of publication) – overall lists covering all of Bach's compositions in order of first publication are however not a way Bach's compositions are usually presented.\n\nListing Bach's works according to their time of composition can't be done comprehensively: for many works the period in which they were composed is a very wide range. For Bach's larger vocal works (cantatas, Passions...) research has led to some more or less generally accepted chronologies, covering most of these works: a catalogue in this sense is Philippe (and Gérard) Zwang's list giving a chronological number to the cantatas BWV 1–215 and 248–249. This list was published in 1982 as \"Guide pratique des cantates de Bach\" in Paris, . A revised edition was published in 2005 ().\n\nVarious catalogues with works by other composers have intersections with collections of works associated with Bach:\nBULLET::::- BR-WFB (or) BR : Bach-Repertorium numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = BR A49\nBULLET::::- Fk (or) F : Falck catalogue numbers for works by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, e.g. BWV 970 = F 25/2\nBULLET::::- H : Helm numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = H 569\nBULLET::::- HWV : Works by George Frideric Handel, e.g. BWV Anh. 106 = HWV 605\nBULLET::::- TWV : Compositions by Georg Philipp Telemann, e.g. BWV 824 = TWV 32:14\nBULLET::::- Warb (or) W : Warburton numbers for works by Johann Christian Bach, e.g. = W A22 (or: )\nBULLET::::- Wq : Wotquenne numbers for works by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, e.g. BWV 1036 = Wq 145\n\nThere are over 1500 works that feature in a catalogue of works by Bach, like the \"Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis\", and/or in a collection of works associated with Bach (e.g. in one of the \"Notebooks for Anna Magdalena Bach\"). Of these around a thousand are original compositions by Bach, that is: more than a mere copy or transcription of an earlier work by himself or another composer.\n\n+ Table sections (collated as in BWV for BWV 1–1126 and Anhang)\n!

{"id": "15912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15912", "title": "John A. Macdonald", "text": "John A. Macdonald\n\nSir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815 – 6 June 1891) was the first prime minister of Canada (1867–1873, 1878–1891). The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century.\n\nMacdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada. By 1857, he had become premier under the colony's unstable political system.\n\nIn 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the British North America Act, 1867 and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867. Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served 19 years; only William Lyon Mackenzie King served longer.\n\nIn 1873, he resigned from office over the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. However, he was re-elected in 1878, continuing until he died in office in 1891. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and completing the railway. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many francophones from his Conservative Party. He died in 1891, still in office; he is respected today for his key role in the formation of Canada.\n\nMacdonald remains a controversial figure in Canadian Politics. He is criticized for his role in the Chinese Head Tax in Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Scandal. However, historical rankings have consistently placed Macdonald as one of the highest rated Prime Ministers in Canadian history.\n\nJohn Alexander Macdonald was born John Alexander Mcdonald in Ramshorn parish in Glasgow, Scotland, on the 10th (official record) or 11th (father's journal) of January 1815. His father was named Hugh, an unsuccessful merchant, who had married John's mother, Helen Shaw, on 21 October 1811. John Alexander Macdonald was the third of five children. After Hugh's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to Kingston, in Upper Canada (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of relatives and connections.\n\nThe family initially lived with another, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James died from a blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to look after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.\n\nJohn initially attended local schools. When he was aged 10, his family scraped together the money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.\n\nMacdonald's parents decided he should become a lawyer after leaving school. As Donald Creighton (who penned a two-volume biography of Macdonald in the 1950s) wrote, \"law was a broad, well-trodden path to comfort, influence, even to power\". It was also \"the obvious choice for a boy who seemed as attracted to study as he was uninterested in trade.\" Besides, Macdonald needed to start earning money immediately to support his family because his father's businesses were again failing. \"I had no boyhood,\" he complained many years later. \"From the age of 15, I began to earn my own living.\"\n\nMacdonald travelled by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as York), where he passed an examination set by The Law Society of Upper Canada, including mathematics, Latin, and history. British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when beginning and ending their tutelage. Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers. Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue. Macdonald was a promising student, and in the summer of 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in Lower Canada (today the southern portion of the province of Quebec). Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law office of a Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill.\n\nIn August 1834, George Mackenzie died of cholera. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald remained at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today Picton, Ontario). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients. Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, and Hugh Macdonald became a bank clerk.\n\nSoon after Macdonald was called to the Bar in February 1836, he arranged to take in two students; both became, like Macdonald, Fathers of Confederation. Oliver Mowat became premier of Ontario, and Alexander Campbell a federal cabinet minister and Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. One early client was Eliza Grimason, an Irish immigrant then aged sixteen, who sought advice concerning a shop she and her husband wanted to buy. Grimason would become one of Macdonald's richest and most loyal supporters, and may have also become his lover. Macdonald joined many local organisations, seeking to become well known in the town. He also sought out high-profile cases, representing accused child rapist William Brass. Brass was hanged for his crime, but Macdonald attracted positive press comments for the quality of his defence. According to his biographer, Richard Gwyn:\nAs a criminal lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed well beyond the narrow confines of the Kingston business community. He was operating now in the arena where he would spend by far the greatest part of his life – the court of public opinion. And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.\nAll male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60 years of age were members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the Rebellions of 1837. Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy.\n\nAlthough most of the trials resulting from the Upper Canada Rebellion took place in Toronto, Macdonald represented one of the defendants in the one trial to take place in Kingston. All the Kingston defendants were acquitted, and a local paper described Macdonald as \"one of the youngest barristers in the Province <nowiki>[who]</nowiki> is rapidly rising in his profession\".\n\nIn late 1838, Macdonald agreed to advise one of a group of American raiders who had crossed the border to liberate Canada from what they saw as the yoke of British colonial oppression. The inept invaders had been captured after the Battle of the Windmill (near Prescott, Ontario), in which 16 Canadians were killed and 60 wounded. Public opinion was inflamed against the prisoners, as they were accused of mutilating the body of a dead Canadian lieutenant. Macdonald biographer Donald Creighton wrote that Kingston was \"mad with grief and rage and horror\" at the allegations. Macdonald could not represent the prisoners, as they were tried by court-martial and civilian counsel had no standing. At the request of Kingston relatives of Daniel George, paymaster of the ill-fated invasion, Macdonald agreed to advise George, who, like the other prisoners, had to conduct his own defence. George was convicted and hanged. According to Macdonald biographer Donald Swainson, \"By 1838, Macdonald's position was secure. He was a public figure, a popular young man, and a senior lawyer.\"\n\nMacdonald continued to expand his practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and a lawyer for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.\n\nIn February 1843, Macdonald announced his candidacy for the post of alderman in Kingston's Fourth Ward. On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.\n\nThe British Parliament had merged Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada effective in 1841. Kingston became the initial capital of the new province; Upper Canada and Lower Canada became known as Canada West and Canada East. In March 1844, Macdonald was asked by local businessmen to stand as Conservative candidate for Kingston in the upcoming legislative election. Macdonald followed the contemporary custom of supplying the voters with large quantities of alcohol. In the era preceding the secret ballot when votes were publicly declared, Macdonald defeated his opponent, Anthony Manahan, by 275 \"shouts\" to 42 when the two-day election concluded on 15 October 1844. At that time, the Legislative Assembly met in Montreal. Macdonald was never an orator, and especially disliked the bombastic addresses of the time. Instead, he found a niche in becoming an expert on election law and parliamentary procedure.\n\nIn 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but the illness recurred the following year, and she became an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was able to return to Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.\n\nAlthough he was often absent due to his wife's illness, Macdonald was able to gain professional and political advancement. In 1846, he was made a Queen's Counsel. The same year, he was offered the non-cabinet post of Solicitor General, but declined it. In 1847, the Joint Premier, William Henry Draper, appointed Macdonald as Receiver General. Accepting the government post required Macdonald to give up his law firm income and spend most of his time in Montreal, away from Isabella. When elections were held in December 1848 and January 1849, Macdonald was easily reelected for Kingston, but the Conservatives lost seats and were forced to resign when the legislature reconvened in March 1848. Macdonald returned to Kingston when the legislature was not sitting, and Isabella joined him there in June. In August, the child John Jr. died suddenly. In March 1850, Isabella Macdonald gave birth to another boy, Hugh John Macdonald, and his father wrote, \"We have got Johnny back again, almost his image.\" Macdonald began to drink heavily around this time, both in public and in private, which Patricia Phenix, who studied Macdonald's private life, attributes to his family troubles.\n\nThe Liberals, or Grits, maintained power in the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did much of the work of putting the government together and served as Attorney General. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Though the most powerful man in the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché as premier.\n\nIn July 1857, Macdonald departed for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On his return to Canada, he was appointed premier in place of the retiring Taché, just in time to lead the Conservatives in a general election. Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189 votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; other Conservatives, however, did badly in Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.\n\nThe Assembly had voted to move the seat of government permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that Queen Victoria decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. Macdonald privately asked the Colonial Office to ensure that the Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election. In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of Ottawa.\n\nOn 28 July 1858, an opposition Canada East member proposed an address to the Queen informing her that Ottawa was an unsuitable place for a national capital. Macdonald's Canada East party members crossed the floor to vote for the address, and the government was defeated. Macdonald resigned, and the Governor General, Sir Edmund Walker Head, invited opposition leader George Brown to form a government. Under the law at that time, Brown and his ministers lost their seats in the Assembly by accepting office, and had to face by-elections. This gave Macdonald a majority pending the by-elections, and he promptly defeated the government. Head refused Brown's request for a dissolution of the Assembly, and Brown and his ministers resigned. Head then asked Macdonald to form a government. The law allowed anyone who had held a ministerial position within the last thirty days to accept a new position without needing to face a by-election; Macdonald and his ministers accepted new positions, then completed what was dubbed the \"Double Shuffle\" by returning to their old posts. In an effort to give the appearance of fairness, Head insisted that Cartier be titular premier, with Macdonald as his deputy.\n\nIn the late 1850s and early 1860s, Canada enjoyed a period of great prosperity. The railroad and telegraph improved communications. According to Macdonald biographer Richard Gwyn, \"In short, Canadians began to become a single community.\" At the same time, the provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage. An act affecting both Canada East and Canada West required a \"double majority\"—a majority of legislators from each of the two sections of the province. This led to increasing deadlock in the Assembly. The two sections each elected 65 legislators, even though Canada West had a larger population. One of Brown's major demands was \"rep by pop\", that is, representation by population, which would lead to Canada West having more seats, and was bitterly opposed by Canada East.\n\nThe American Civil War led to fears in Canada and in Britain that once the Americans had concluded their internal warfare, they would invade Canada again. Britain asked the Canadians to pay a part of the expense of defence, and a Militia Bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1862. The opposition objected to the expense, and Canada East representatives feared that French-Canadians would have to fight in a British-instigated war. At the time, Macdonald was drinking heavily, and he failed to provide much leadership on behalf of the bill. The government fell over the bill, and the Grits took over under the leadership of John Sandfield Macdonald (no relation to John A. Macdonald). John A. Macdonald did not remain out of power long; the parties remained closely matched, with a handful of independents able to destroy any government. The new government fell in May 1863, but Head allowed a new election, which made little change to party strength. In December 1863, Canada West MP Albert Norton Richards accepted the post of Solicitor-General, and so had to face a by-election. John A. Macdonald campaigned against Richards personally, and Richards was defeated by a Conservative. The switch in seats cost the Grits their majority, and they resigned in March. John A. Macdonald returned to office with Taché as titular premier. The Taché-Macdonald government was defeated in June. The parties were deadlocked to such an extent that, according to Swainson, \"It was clear to everybody that the constitution of the Province of Canada was dead\".\n\nAs his government had fallen again, Macdonald approached the new governor general, Lord Monck, and obtained a dissolution. Before he could act on it, he was approached by Brown through intermediaries; the Grit leader felt that the crisis gave the parties the opportunity to join together for constitutional reform. Brown had led a parliamentary committee on confederation among the British North American colonies, which had reported back just before the Taché-Macdonald government fell. Brown was more interested in representation by population; Macdonald's priority was a federation that the other colonies could join. The two compromised and agreed that the new government would support the \"federative principle\"—a conveniently elastic phrase. The discussions were not public knowledge and Macdonald stunned the Assembly by announcing that the dissolution was being postponed because of progress in negotiations with Brown—the two men were not only political rivals, but were known to hate each other.\n\nThe parties resolved their differences, joining in the Great Coalition, with only the Parti rouge of Canada East, led by Jean-Baptiste-Éric Dorion, remaining apart. A conference, called by the Colonial Office, was scheduled for 1 September 1864 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; the Maritimes were to consider a union. The Canadians obtained permission to send a delegation—led by Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown—to what became known as the Charlottetown Conference. At its conclusion, the Maritime delegations expressed a willingness to join a confederation if the details could be worked out.\n\nIn October 1864, delegates for confederation met in Quebec City for the Quebec Conference, where the Seventy-Two Resolutions were agreed to—they would form the basis of Canada's government. The Great Coalition was endangered by Taché's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown felt that he had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau.\n\nIn 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's legislative assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33. None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald and his colleagues financed pro-confederation candidates in the New Brunswick general election, resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, Nova Scotia's premier, Charles Tupper, pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature. A final conference, to be held in London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers. In December 1866, Macdonald both led the London Conference, winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, Agnes Bernard. Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, Hewitt Bernard; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference. In February, he married Agnes at St George's, Hanover Square. On 8 March, the British North America Act, 1867, which would thereafter serve as the major part of Canada's constitution, passed the House of Commons (it had previously passed the House of Lords). Queen Victoria gave the bill Royal Assent on 29 March 1867.\n\nMacdonald had favoured the union coming into force on 15 July, fearing that the preparations would not be completed any earlier. The British favoured an earlier date and, on 22 May, it was announced that Canada would come into existence on 1 July. Lord Monck appointed Macdonald as the new nation's first prime minister. With the birth of the new nation, Canada East and Canada West became separate provinces, known as Quebec and Ontario. Macdonald was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on that first observance of what came to be known as Canada Day, 1 July 1867.\n\nCanada's economic growth was quite slow at only 1% annually 1867–1896. Canada verged on stagnation so many residents emigrated to the United States, where growth was much more rapid. Macdonald's solution was to build the transcontinental railroad to stimulate growth, and to implement a \"National Policy\" of high tariffs that would protect the small Canadian firms from American competition.\n\nMacdonald and his government faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening to withdraw from the union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.\n\nIn August 1867, the new nation's first general election was held; Macdonald's party won easily, with strong support in both large provinces, and a majority from New Brunswick. Parliament convened in November, surprisingly without Brown, who was defeated in Ontario and never served as a member of the House of Commons of Canada. By 1869, Nova Scotia had agreed to remain part of Canada after a promise of better financial terms—the first of many provinces to negotiate concessions from Ottawa. Pressure from London and Ottawa failed to gain the accession of Newfoundland, whose voters rejected a Confederation platform in a general election in October 1869.\nIn 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It soon became apparent that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She was never able to walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.\n\nMacdonald had once been tepid on the question of westward expansion of the Canadian provinces; as Prime Minister he became a strong supporter of a bicoastal Canada. Immediately upon Confederation, he sent commissioners to London who in due course successfully negotiated the transfer of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to Canada. The Hudson's Bay Company received $1,500,000, and retained some trading posts as well as one-twentieth of the best farmland. Prior to the effective date of acquisition, the Canadian government faced unrest in the Red River Colony (today southeastern Manitoba, centred on Winnipeg). The local people, including the Métis, were fearful that rule would be imposed on them which did not take into account their interests, and rose in the Red River Rebellion led by Louis Riel. Unwilling to pay for a territory in insurrection, Macdonald had troops put down the uprising before 15 July 1870 formal transfer, but as a result of the unrest, the Red River Colony joined Confederation as the province of Manitoba, while the rest of the purchased lands became the North-West Territories. Following the North-West Rebellion of 1885 Macdonald implemented restrictions upon the movement of indigenous groups, requiring them to receive formal permission from an Indian Department Official in order to go off reserve.\nMacdonald also wished to secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was interest in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt that would have to be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.\n\nThere were continuing disputes with the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission was appointed to settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post he was reluctant to accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.\n\nIn the run-up to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet to formulate a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.\n\nIn early 1872, Macdonald submitted the treaty for ratification, and it passed the Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, for the most part, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.\n\nMacdonald had hoped to award the charter for the Canadian Pacific Railway in early 1872, but negotiations dragged on between the government and the financiers. Macdonald's government awarded the Allan group the charter in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award the charter. Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the Pacific Scandal. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States's Northern Pacific Railway, had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received the charter, and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time the charter was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 in contributions from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in Montreal East (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of Provencher). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with Bright's disease, which may have been causing his judgment to lapse; he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.\n\nEven before Cartier's death, Macdonald attempted to use delay to extricate the government. The Opposition responded by leaking documents to friendly newspapers. On 18 July, three papers published a telegram dated August 1872 from Macdonald requesting another $10,000 and promising \"it will be the last time of asking\". Macdonald was able to get a prorogation of Parliament in August by appointing a Royal Commission to look into the matter, but when Parliament reconvened in late October, the Liberals, feeling Macdonald could be defeated over the issue, applied immense pressure to wavering members.\n\nOn 3 November, Macdonald rose in the Commons to defend the government, and according to his biographer P.B. Waite, gave \"the speech of his life, and, in a sense, for his life\". He began his speech at 9 p.m., looking frail and ill, an appearance which quickly improved. As he spoke, he consumed glass after glass of gin and water. He denied that there had been a corrupt bargain, and stated that such contributions were common to both political parties. After five hours, Macdonald concluded,\nI leave it with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the decision of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, and it is no vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.\nMacdonald's speech was seen as a personal triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, Lord Dufferin on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, \"Well, that's got along with\", and when asked what he meant, told her of his resignation, and stated, \"It's a relief to be out of it.\" He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again. When Macdonald announced his resignation in the Commons, Conservative and Liberal MPs traded places on the benches of the House of Commons, though one Conservative MP, British Columbia's Amor De Cosmos remained in his place, thereby joining the Liberals.\n\nOn 6 November 1873, Macdonald offered his resignation as party leader to his caucus; it was refused. Mackenzie called an election for January 1874; the Conservatives were reduced to 70 seats out of the 206 in the Commons, giving Mackenzie a massive majority. The Conservatives bested the Liberals only in British Columbia; Mackenzie had called the terms by which the province had joined Confederation \"impossible\". Macdonald was returned in Kingston but was unseated on an election contest when bribery was proven; he won the ensuing by-election by 17 votes. According to Swainson, most observers viewed Macdonald as finished in politics, \"a used-up and dishonoured man\".\n\nMacdonald was content to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in opposition and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald had come to believe that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway—the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.\n\nBy 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives had adopted protection as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches at a number of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a chord with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14 seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.\nWhen Parliament convened in 1877, the Conservatives were confident and the Liberals defensive. After the Tories had a successful session in the early part of the year, another series of picnics commenced in a wide belt around Toronto. Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier. More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the \"National Policy\": high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railroad, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada. These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted—at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected.\n\nThe final days of the 3rd Canadian Parliament were marked by explosive conflict, as Macdonald and Tupper alleged that MP and railway financier Donald Smith had been allowed to build the Pembina branch of the CPR (connecting to American lines) as a reward for betraying the Conservatives during the Pacific Scandal. The altercation continued even after the Commons had been summoned to the Senate to hear the dissolution read, as Macdonald spoke the final words recorded in the 3rd Parliament: \"That fellow Smith is the biggest liar I ever saw!\"\n\nThe election was called for 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters tried to get him to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35 years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the election was to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.\n\nPart of the National Policy was implemented in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry—finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs for the remainder of his life.\nBy the 1880s, Macdonald was becoming more frail, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the \"Intoxicating Liquors Bill\" which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. \"The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety's of his middle years, were dwindling away now into memories.\" As the budget moved forward, Macdonald studied the railway issue, and found the picture unexpectedly good. Although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by George Stephen, willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, but because of the ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald. In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain's remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which would not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir Alexander Galt as High Commissioner to Britain. With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority in 1882. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of Carleton.\n\nThe transcontinental railroad project was heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted of land along the route of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for a nation with only 4.1 million people in 1881. Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the Rocky Mountains difficult, the route north of Lake Superior proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the muskeg. When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury—the bill authorizing it passed the Senate just before the firm would have become insolvent.\n\nThe Northwest again saw unrest. Many of the Manitoban Métis had moved into the territories. Negotiations between the Métis and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult, Riel had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, he journeyed to Regina with the connivance of Macdonald's government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with. Instead, the Métis rose the following year under Riel in the North-West Rebellion. Macdonald put down the rebellion with militia troops transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. The hanging of Riel proved bitterly controversial, and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally French Canadian) from the Conservatives—they soon realign themselves with the Liberals.\n\nThe CPR was almost bankrupt, but its essential role in rushing troops to the crisis proved its worth, and Parliament provided money for its completion. On 7 November 1885, CPR manager William Van Horne who wired Macdonald from Craigellachie, British Columbia that the last spike was driven home.\n\nIn 1885 Macdonald government enacted the \"Chinese Immigration Act, 1885\". Macdonald told the House of Commons that, if the Chinese were not excluded from Canada, \"the Aryan character of the future of British America should be destroyed \".\n\nIn the summer of 1886, Macdonald traveled for the only time to western Canada, traveling from town to town by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, and to get a better view, the two would sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.\n\nIn 1886, another dispute arose over fishing rights with the United States. Americans fishermen had been using treaty provisions allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing. Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, to the dismay of the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the Governor General, Lord Lansdowne, to reserve Royal Assent for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. After considerable discussion, the British government allowed Royal Assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.\n\nFearing continued loss of political strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned to hold an election by the end of 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when an Ontario provincial election was called by Macdonald's former student, Liberal Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority. Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for an election on 22 February. During the campaign, Macdonald suffered another blow when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after the October 1886 Quebec election), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new High Commissioner to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, Edward Blake, ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The Tories even took a narrow majority of Quebec's seats despite resentment over Riel's hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again. Even the younger ministers, such as future Prime Minister John Thompson, who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted the Prime Minister was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.\n\nBlake, whom Macdonald biographer Gwyn describes as the Liberal Party's \"worst campaigner until Stéphane Dion early in the twenty-first century\", resigned after the defeat, to be replaced by Wilfrid Laurier. Under Laurier's early leadership, the Liberals, who had accepted much of the National Policy under Blake while questioning details, rejected it entirely, calling for \"unrestricted reciprocity\", or free trade, with the United States. Advocates of Laurier's plan argued that north–south trade made more economic sense than trying to trade across the vast, empty prairies, using a CPR which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates. Macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with the United States, but was reluctant to lower many tariffs. American advocates of what they dubbed \"commercial union\" saw it as a prelude to political union, and did not scruple to say so, causing additional controversy in Canada.\n\nMacdonald called an election for 5 March 1891. The Liberals were heavily financed by American interests; the Conservatives drew much financial support from the CPR. The 76-year-old Prime Minister collapsed during the campaign, and conducted political activities from his brother-in-law's house in Kingston. The Conservatives gained slightly in the popular vote, but their majority was trimmed to 27. The parties broke even in the central part of the country but the Conservatives dominated in the Maritimes and Western Canada, leading Liberal MP Richard John Cartwright to claim that Macdonald's majority was dependent on \"the shreds and patches of Confederation\". After the election, Laurier and his Liberals grudgingly accepted the National Policy, and when Laurier himself later became Prime Minister, he adopted it with only minor changes.\n\nAfter the election, Macdonald suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralysed and unable to speak. \"The Old Chieftain\" lingered for days, remaining mentally alert, before dying in the late evening of Saturday, 6 June 1891. Thousands filed by his open casket in the Senate Chamber; his body was transported by funeral train to his hometown of Kingston, with crowds greeting the train at each stop. On arrival in Kingston, Macdonald lay in state again in City Hall, wearing the uniform of an Imperial Privy Counselor. He was buried in Cataraqui Cemetery in Kingston, his grave near that of his first wife, Isabella.\n\nWilfrid Laurier paid tribute to Macdonald in the House of Commons:\nIn fact the place of Sir John A. Macdonald in this country was so large and so absorbing that it is almost impossible to conceive that the politics of this country, the fate of this country, will continue without him. His loss overwhelms us.\nMacdonald served just under 19 years as Prime Minister, a length of service only surpassed by William Lyon Mackenzie King. In polls, Macdonald has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest Prime Ministers in Canadian history.\n\nUnlike his American counterpart, George Washington, no cities or political subdivisions are named for Macdonald (with the exception of a small Manitoba village), nor are there any massive monuments. A peak in the Rockies, Mount Macdonald (c. 1887) at Rogers Pass, is named for him. In 2001, Parliament designated 11 January as Sir John A. Macdonald Day, but the day is not a federal holiday and generally passes unremarked. He appears on Canadian ten-dollar notes printed between 1971 and 2018, and will be featured on either the $50 or $100 note when they are redesigned in the future. In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint featured Macdonald's face on the Canadian two dollar coin, the Toonie, to celebrate his 200th birthday. He also gives his name to Ottawa's Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (River Parkway before 2012), Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport (renamed in 1993) and Ontario Highway 401 (the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway c. 1968), though these facilities are rarely referred to using his name.\n\nA number of sites associated with Macdonald are preserved. His gravesite has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Bellevue House in Kingston, where the Macdonald family lived in the 1840s, is also a National Historic Site administered by Parks Canada, and has been restored to that time period. His Ottawa home, Earnscliffe, still stands and is today the official residence of the British High Commissioner to Canada. Statues have been erected to Macdonald across Canada; one stands on Parliament Hill in Ottawa (by Louis-Philippe Hebert c. 1895). A statue of Macdonald stands atop a granite plinth originally intended for a statue of Queen Victoria in Toronto's Queen's Park, looking south on University Avenue. Macdonald's statue also stands in Kingston's City Park; the Kingston Historical Society annually holds a memorial service in his honour.\n\nA square outside of Union Station (Toronto) will be named in his honour.\n\nA memorial was erected around 1895 on the front buttress of St David's Church on Ingram Street in Glasgow next to the Ramshorn Cemetery, near his birthplace in Glasgow. (His birthplace is most likely 20 Brunswick Street, demolished in 2017 in favour of a condo redevelopment.\n\nIn 2018 a statue of Macdonald was removed from outside Victoria City Hall, as part of the city's program for reconciliation with local First Nations. A biographical online article about Macdonald was deleted from the Scottish government's website in August 2018. A spokesperson for the Scottish government stated: \"We acknowledge controversy around Sir John A Macdonald’s legacy and the legitimate concerns expressed by Indigenous communities\". In 2017, The Canadian Historical Association voted to remove Macdonald's name from their prestigious 'Sir John A Macdonald' prize for best scholarly book about Canadian history. Historian James Daschuk acknowledges Sir John A Macdonald's contributions as a founding figure of Canada, but however he states 'He built the country. But he built the country on the backs of the Indigenous people'.\nConservative Senator Hugh Segal believes that Macdonald's true monument is Canada itself: \"Without Macdonald we'd be a country that begins somewhere at the Manitoba-Ontario border that probably goes throughout the east. Newfoundland would be like Alaska and I think that would also go for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. We'd be buying our oil from the United States. It would diminish our quality of life and range of careers, and our role in the world would have been substantially reduced.\" Macdonald's biographers note his contribution to establishing Canada as a nation. Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook: \"He not only helped to create Canada, but contributed immeasurably to its character.\" Gwyn said of Macdonald,\n\nMacdonald was awarded the following honorary degrees:\n! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Location !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Date !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:40%;\" School !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Degree\n\nBULLET::::- ; standard biography\nBULLET::::- ; essays by scholars\n\nBULLET::::- , essays by scholars\n\nBULLET::::- ; mostly drawn from debates in Parliament\n\nBULLET::::- Library and Archives Canada: gallery of papers\nBULLET::::- John A.

{"id": "15915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15915", "title": "John Diefenbaker", "text": "John Diefenbaker\n\nJohn George Diefenbaker (; September 18, 1895 – August 16, 1979) was the 13th prime minister of Canada from 1957 to 1963. He was the only Progressive Conservative (PC or Tory) leader after 1930 and before 1979 to lead the party to an election victory, doing so three times, although only once with a majority of seats in the House of Commons of Canada.\n\nDiefenbaker was born in southwestern Ontario in the small town of Neustadt in 1895. In 1903, his family migrated west to the portion of the North-West Territories which would shortly thereafter become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province, and was interested in politics from a young age. After brief service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until he was finally elected to the House of Commons in 1940.\n\nDiefenbaker was repeatedly a candidate for the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate. During his six years as Prime Minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered for his role in the 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project.\n\nFactionalism returned in full force as the Progressive Conservatives fell from power in 1963, and while Diefenbaker's performance as Opposition Leader was heralded, his second loss at the polls prompted opponents within the party force him to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party leader at the last moment, but only attracted minimal support and withdrew. He remained an MP until his death in 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the first Tory Prime Minister since Diefenbaker.\n\nDiefenbaker was born on September 18, 1895, in Neustadt, Ontario, to William Thomas Diefenbaker and the former Mary Florence Bannerman. His father was the son of German immigrants from Adersbach (near Sinsheim) in Baden; Mary Diefenbaker was of Scottish descent and Diefenbaker was Baptist. The family moved to several locations in Ontario in John's early years. William Diefenbaker was a teacher, and had deep interests in history and politics, which he sought to inculcate in his students. He had remarkable success doing so; of the 28 students at his school near Toronto in 1903, four, including his son, John, served as Conservative MPs in the 19th Canadian Parliament beginning in 1940.\n\nThe Diefenbaker family moved west in 1903, for William Diefenbaker to accept a position near Fort Carlton, then in the Northwest Territories (now in Saskatchewan). In 1906, William claimed a quarter-section, of undeveloped land near Borden, Saskatchewan. In February 1910, the Diefenbaker family moved to Saskatoon, the site of the University of Saskatchewan. William and Mary Diefenbaker felt that John and his brother Elmer would have greater educational opportunities in Saskatoon.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker had been interested in politics from an early age, and told his mother at the age of eight or nine that he would some day be Prime Minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John claimed that his first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the University's first building. The present and future Prime Ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Sir Wilfrid commented on the newsboy who had ended their conversation by saying, \"I can't waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work.\" The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Saskatoon, in 1912, Diefenbaker entered the University of Saskatchewan. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1915, and his Master of Arts the following year.\n\nDiefenbaker was commissioned a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF in May 1916. In September, Diefenbaker was part of a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.\n\nAfter leaving the military in 1917, Diefenbaker returned to Saskatchewan where he resumed his work as an articling student in law. He received his law degree in 1919, the first student to secure three degrees from the University of Saskatchewan. On June 30, 1919, he was called to the bar, and the following day, opened a small practice in the village of Wakaw, Saskatchewan.\n\nAlthough Wakaw had a population of only 400, it sat at the heart of a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.\n\nDiefenbaker won the local people over through his success; in his first year in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning approximately half of his cases. He rarely called defence witnesses, thereby avoiding the possibility of rebuttal witnesses for the Crown, and securing the last word for himself. In late 1920, he was elected to the village council to serve a three-year term.\n\nDiefenbaker would often spend weekends with his parents in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.\n\nAfter four years in Wakaw, Diefenbaker so dominated the local legal practice that his competitor left town. On May 1, 1924, Diefenbaker moved to Prince Albert, leaving a law partner in charge of the Wakaw office.\n\nSince 1905, when Saskatchewan entered Confederation, the province had been dominated by the Liberal Party, which practised highly effective machine politics. Diefenbaker was fond of stating, in his later years, that the only protection a Conservative had in the province was that afforded by the game laws.\n\nDiefenbaker's father, William, was a Liberal; however, John Diefenbaker found himself attracted to the Conservative Party. Free trade was widely popular throughout Western Canada, but Diefenbaker was convinced by the Conservative position that free trade would make Canada an economic dependent of the United States. However, he did not speak publicly of his politics. Diefenbaker recalled in his memoirs that, in 1921, he had been elected as secretary of the Wakaw Liberal Association while absent in Saskatoon, and had returned to find the association's records in his office. He promptly returned them to the association president. Diefenbaker also stated that he had been told that if he became a Liberal candidate, \"there was no position in the province which would not be open to him.\"\n\nIt was not until 1925 that Diefenbaker publicly came forward as a Conservative, a year in which both federal and Saskatchewan provincial elections were held. Journalist and historian Peter C. Newman, in his best-selling account of the Diefenbaker years, suggested that this choice was made for practical, rather than political reasons, as Diefenbaker had little chance of defeating established politicians and securing the Liberal nomination for either the House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly. The provincial election took place in early June; Liberals would later claim that Diefenbaker had campaigned for their party in the election. On June 19, however, Diefenbaker addressed a Conservative organizing committee, and on August 6, was nominated as the party's candidate for the federal riding of Prince Albert, a district in which the party's last candidate had lost his election deposit. A nasty campaign ensued, in which Diefenbaker was called a \"Hun\" because of his German-derived surname. The 1925 federal election was held on October 29; he finished third behind the Liberal and Progressive Party candidates, losing his deposit.\nThe winning candidate, Charles McDonald, did not hold the seat long, resigning it to open a place for the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had been defeated in his Ontario riding. The Tories ran no candidate against Mackenzie King in the by-election on February 15, 1926, and he won easily. Although in the 1925 federal election, the Conservatives had won the greatest number of seats, Mackenzie King continued as Prime Minister with the tacit support of the Progressives. Mackenzie King held office for several months until he finally resigned when the Governor General, Lord Byng, refused a dissolution. Conservative Party leader Arthur Meighen became Prime Minister, but was quickly defeated in the House of Commons, and Byng finally granted a dissolution of Parliament. Diefenbaker, who had been confirmed as Conservative candidate, stood against Mackenzie King in the 1926 election, a rare direct electoral contest between two Canadian Prime Ministers. Mackenzie King triumphed easily, and regained his position as Prime Minister.\n\nDiefenbaker stood for the Legislative Assembly in the 1929 provincial election. He was defeated, but Saskatchewan Conservatives formed their first government, with help from smaller parties. As the defeated Conservative candidate for Prince Albert City, he was given charge of political patronage there, and was created a King's Counsel. Three weeks after his electoral defeat, he married Saskatoon teacher Edna Brower.\n\nDiefenbaker chose not to stand for the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a majority in the election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister. Diefenbaker continued a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 ballots were cast.\n\nIn 1934, when the Crown prosecutor for Prince Albert resigned to become the Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not stand in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In the waning days of the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.\n\nSaskatchewan Conservatives eventually arranged a leadership convention for October 28, 1936. Eleven people were nominated, including Diefenbaker. The other ten candidates all deemed the provincial party in such hopeless shape that they withdrew, and Diefenbaker won the position by default. Diefenbaker asked the federal party for $10,000 in financial support, but the funds were refused, and the Conservatives were shut out of the legislature in the 1938 provincial elections for the second consecutive time. Diefenbaker himself was defeated in the Arm River riding by 190 votes. With the province-wide Conservative vote having fallen to 12%, Diefenbaker offered his resignation to a post-election party meeting in Moose Jaw, but it was refused. Diefenbaker continued to run the provincial party out of his law office, and paid the party's debts from his own pocket.\n\nDiefenbaker quietly sought the Conservative nomination for the federal riding of Lake Centre, but was unwilling to risk a divisive intra-party squabble. In what Diefenbaker biographer Smith states \"appears to have been an elaborate and prearranged charade\", Diefenbaker attended the nominating convention as keynote speaker, but withdrew when his name was proposed, stating a local man should be selected. The winner among the six remaining candidates, riding president W. B. Kelly, declined the nomination, urging the delegates to select Diefenbaker, which they promptly did. Mackenzie King called a general election for March 25, 1940. The incumbent in Lake Centre was the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, Liberal John Frederick Johnston. Diefenbaker campaigned aggressively in Lake Centre, holding 63 rallies and seeking to appeal to members of all parties. On election day, he defeated Johnston by 280 votes on what was otherwise a disastrous day for the Conservatives, who won only 39 seats out of the 245 in the House of Commons—their lowest total since Confederation.\n\nDiefenbaker joined a shrunken and demoralized Conservative caucus in the House of Commons. The Conservative leader, Robert Manion, failed to win a place in the Commons in the election, which saw the Liberals take 181 seats. The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons had only a slight role in the war effort; under the state of emergency, most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.\n\nDiefenbaker was appointed to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed arrest and detention without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden speech as an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. Diefenbaker described an unsuccessful fight against the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians in his memoirs, however, this is disputed.\n\nAccording to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his political skills. However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as \"a mob\". When Diefenbaker accompanied two other Conservative leaders to a briefing by Mackenzie King on the war, the Prime Minister exploded at Diefenbaker (a constituent of his), \"What business do you have to be here? You strike me to the heart every time you speak.\"\n\nThe Conservatives elected a floor leader, and in 1941 approached former Prime Minister Meighen, who had been appointed as a senator by Bennett, about becoming party leader again. Meighen agreed, and resigned his Senate seat, but lost a by-election for an Ontario seat in the House of Commons. He remained as leader for several months, although he could not enter the chamber of the House of Commons. Meighen sought to move the Tories to the left, in order to undercut the Liberals and to take support away from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)). To that end, he sought to draft the Liberal-Progressive premier of Manitoba, John Bracken, to lead the Conservatives. Diefenbaker objected to what he saw as an attempt to rig the party's choice of new leader and stood for the leadership himself at the party's 1942 leadership convention. Bracken was elected on the second ballot; Diefenbaker finished a distant third in both polls. At Bracken's request, the convention changed the party's name to \"Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.\" Bracken chose not to seek entry to the House through a by-election, and when the Conservatives elected a new floor leader, Diefenbaker was defeated by one vote.\n\nBracken was elected to the Commons in the 1945 general election, and for the first time in five years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals' 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats. Diefenbaker increased his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—but by a CCF candidate. The Prime Minister was returned in an Ontario by-election within months.\n\nDiefenbaker staked out a position on the populist left of the PC party. Though most Canadians were content to look to Parliament for protection of civil liberties, Diefenbaker called for a Bill of Rights, calling it \"the only way to stop the march on the part of the government towards arbitrary power\". He objected to the great powers used by the Mackenzie King government to attempt to root out Soviet spies after the war, such as imprisonment without trial, and complained about the government's proclivity for letting its wartime powers become permanent.\n\nIn early 1948, Mackenzie King, by now aged 73, announced his retirement; later that year Louis St. Laurent succeeded him. Although Bracken had nearly doubled the Tory representation in the House, prominent Tories were increasingly unhappy with his leadership, and pressured him to stand down. These party bosses believed that Ontario Premier George A. Drew, who had won three successive provincial elections and had even made inroads in francophone ridings, was the man to lead the Progressive Conservatives to victory. When Bracken resigned on July 17, 1948, Diefenbaker announced his candidacy. The party's backers, principally financiers headquartered on Toronto's Bay Street, preferred Drew's conservative political stances to Diefenbaker's Western populism. Tory leaders packed the 1948 leadership convention in Ottawa in favour of Drew, appointing more than 300 delegates at-large. One cynical party member commented, \"Ghost delegates with ghost ballots, marked by the ghostly hidden hand of Bay Street, are going to pick George Drew, and he'll deliver a ghost-written speech that'll cheer us all up, as we march briskly into a political graveyard.\" Drew easily defeated Diefenbaker on the first ballot. St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and the Tories were decimated, falling to 41 seats, only two more than the party's 1940 nadir. Despite intense efforts to make the Progressive Conservatives appeal to Quebecers, the party won only two seats in the province.\n\nNewman argued that but for Diefenbaker's many defeats, he would never have become Prime Minister:\nIf, as a neophyte lawyer, he had succeeded in winning the Prince Albert seat in the federal elections of 1925 or 1926, ... Diefenbaker would probably have been remembered only as an obscure minister in Bennett's Depression cabinet ... If he had carried his home-town mayoralty in 1933, ... he'd probably not be remembered at all ... If he had succeeded in his bid for the national leadership in 1942, he might have taken the place of John Bracken on his six-year march to oblivion as leader of a party that had not changed itself enough to follow a Prairie radical ... <nowiki>[If he had defeated Drew in 1948, he]</nowiki> would have been free to flounder before the political strength of Louis St. Laurent in the 1949 and 1953 campaigns.\nThe governing Liberals repeatedly attempted to deprive Diefenbaker of his parliamentary seat. In 1948, Lake Centre was redistricted to remove areas which strongly supported Diefenbaker. In spite of that, he was returned in the 1949 election, the only PC member from Saskatchewan. In 1952, a redistricting committee dominated by Liberals abolished Lake Centre entirely, dividing its voters among three other ridings. Diefenbaker stated in his memoirs that he had considered retiring from the House; with Drew only a year older than he was, the Westerner saw little prospect of advancement, and had received tempting offers from Ontario law firms. However, the gerrymandering so angered him that he decided to fight for a seat. Diefenbaker's party had taken Prince Albert only once, in 1911, but he decided to stand in that riding for the 1953 election, and was successful. He would hold that seat for the rest of his life. Even though Diefenbaker campaigned nationally for party candidates, the Progressive Conservatives gained little, rising to 51 seats as St. Laurent led the Liberals to a fifth successive majority. In addition to trying to secure his departure from Parliament, the government opened a home for unwed Indian mothers next door to Diefenbaker's home in Prince Albert.\n\nDiefenbaker continued practising law. In 1951, he gained national attention by accepting the \"Atherton\" case, in which a young telegraph operator had been accused of negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.\n\nAlthough Edna Diefenbaker had been devoted to advancing her husband's career, in the mid-1940s she began to suffer mental illness, and was placed in a private mental hospital for a time. She later fell ill from leukemia, and died in 1951. In 1953, Diefenbaker married Olive Palmer (formerly Olive Freeman), whom he had courted while living in Wakaw. Olive Diefenbaker became a great source of strength to her husband. There were no children born of either marriage.\n\nDiefenbaker won Prince Albert in 1953, even as the Tories suffered a second consecutive disastrous defeat under Drew. Speculation arose in the press that the leader might be pressured to step aside. Drew was determined to remain, however, and Diefenbaker was careful to avoid any action that might be seen as disloyal. However, Diefenbaker was never a member of the \"Five O'clock Club\" of Drew intimates who met the leader in his office for a drink and gossip each day. By 1955, there was a widespread feeling among Tories that Drew was not capable of leading the party to a victory. At the same time, the Liberals were in flux as the aging St. Laurent tired of politics. Drew was able to damage the government in a weeks-long battle over the TransCanada pipeline in 1956—the so-called Pipeline Debate—in which the government, in a hurry to obtain financing for the pipeline, imposed closure before the debate even began. The Tories and the CCF combined to obstruct business in the House for weeks before the Liberals were finally able to pass the measure. Diefenbaker played a relatively minor role in the Pipeline Debate, speaking only once.\nBy 1956, the Social Credit Party was becoming a potential rival to the Tories as Canada's main right-wing party. Canadian journalist and author Bruce Hutchison discussed the state of the Tories in 1956:\nWhen a party calling itself Conservative can think of nothing better than to outbid the Government's election promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results ... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years ... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.\nIn August 1956, Drew fell ill and many within the party urged him to step aside, feeling that the Progressive Conservatives needed vigorous leadership with an election likely within a year. He resigned in late September, and Diefenbaker immediately announced his candidacy for the leadership. A number of Progressive Conservative leaders, principally from the Ontario wing of the party, started a \"Stop Diefenbaker\" movement, and wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a possible candidate. When Smith declined, they could find no one of comparable stature to stand against Diefenbaker. At the leadership convention in Ottawa in December 1956, Diefenbaker won on the first ballot, and the dissidents reconciled themselves to his victory. After all, they reasoned, Diefenbaker was now 61 and unlikely to lead the party for more than one general election, an election they believed would be won by the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.\n\nIn January 1957, Diefenbaker took his place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent informed him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, and a lack of aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.\n\nDiefenbaker ran on a platform which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged to work with the provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform \"a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance\". Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in seeing people than in talking to cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.\n\nDiefenbaker characterized the Tory program in a nationwide telecast on April 30:\nIt is a program ... for a united Canada, for one Canada, for Canada first, in every aspect of our political and public life, for the welfare of the average man and woman. That is my approach to public affairs and has been throughout my life ... A Canada, united from Coast to Coast, wherein there will be freedom for the individual, freedom of enterprise and where there will be a Government which, in all its actions, will remain the servant and not the master of the people.\nThe final Gallup poll before the election showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just before the election, \"Maclean's\" magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale the morning after the vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have attempted to form a government, however, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with the Progressive Conservatives, he would have likely faced a quick defeat at the Commons. St. Laurent instead resigned, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister.\n\nWhen John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957, only one Progressive Conservative MP, Earl Rowe, had served in federal governmental office, for a brief period under Bennett in 1935. Rowe was no friend of Diefenbaker, and was given no place in his government. Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as Secretary of State for Canada, the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet post, and Michael Starr as Minister of Labour, the first Canadian of Ukrainian descent to serve in Cabinet.\n\nAs the Parliament buildings had been lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker was forced to wait until the fall to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II – the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch – the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions. The Liberals were ineffective in opposition, with the party in the midst of a leadership race after St. Laurent's resignation as party leader.\n\nWith the Conservatives leading in the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a new election, hopeful that his party would gain a majority of seats. The strong Liberal presence meant that the Governor General could refuse a dissolution request early in a parliament's term and allow them to form government if Diefenbaker resigned. Diefenbaker sought a pretext for a new election.\n\nSuch an excuse presented itself when former Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester Pearson attended his first parliamentary session as Leader of the Opposition on January 20, 1958, four days after becoming the Liberal leader. In his first speech as leader, Pearson (recently returned from Oslo where he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize), moved an amendment to supply, and called, not for an election, but for the Progressive Conservatives to resign, allowing the Liberals to form a government. Pearson stated that the condition of the economy required \"a Government pledged to implement Liberal policies\". Government MPs laughed at Pearson, as did members of the press who were present. Pearson later recorded in his memoirs that he knew that his \"first attack on the government had been a failure, indeed a fiasco\". Diefenbaker spoke for two hours and three minutes, and devastated his Liberal opposition. He mocked Pearson, contrasting the party leader's address at the Liberal leadership convention with his speech to the House:\nOn Thursday there was shrieking defiance, on the following Monday there is shrinking indecision ... The only reason that this motion is worded as it is [\"sic\"] is that my honourable friends opposite quake when they think of what will happen if an election comes ... It is the resignation from responsibility of a great party.\nDiefenbaker read from an internal report provided to the St. Laurent government in early 1957, warning that a recession was coming, and stated:\nAcross the way, Mr. Speaker, sit the purveyors of gloom who would endeavour for political purposes, to panic the Canadian people ... They had a warning ... Did they tell us that? No. Mr. Speaker, why did they not reveal this? Why did they not act when the House was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information ... You concealed the facts, that is what you did.\nAccording to the Minister of Finance, Donald Fleming, \"Pearson looked at first merry, then serious, then uncomfortable, then disturbed, and finally sick.\" Pearson recorded in his memoirs that the Prime Minister \"tore me to shreds\". Prominent Liberal frontbencher Paul Martin called Diefenbaker's response \"one of the greatest devastating speeches\" and \"Diefenbaker's great hour\". On February 1, Diefenbaker asked the Governor General, Vincent Massey, to dissolve Parliament, alleging that though St. Laurent had promised cooperation, Pearson had made it clear he would not follow his predecessor's lead. Massey agreed to the dissolution, and Diefenbaker set an election date of March 31, 1958.\n\nThe 1958 election campaign saw a huge outpouring of public support for the Progressive Conservatives. At the opening campaign rally in Winnipeg on February 12 voters filled the hall until the doors had to be closed for safety reasons. They were promptly broken down by the crowd outside. At the rally, Diefenbaker called for \"<nowiki>[a]</nowiki> new vision. A new hope. A new soul for Canada.\" He pledged to open the Canadian North, to seek out its resources and make it a place for settlements. The conclusion to his speech expounded on what became known as \"The Vision\",\nThis is the vision: One Canada. One Canada, where Canadians will have preserved to them the control of their own economic and political destiny. Sir John A. Macdonald saw a Canada from east to west: he opened the west. I see a new Canada—a Canada of the North. This is the vision!\nPierre Sévigny, who would be elected an MP in 1958, recalled the gathering, \"When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, I saw people kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after.\" When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words \"\"Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!\"\" (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton \"thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy.\" Michael Starr remembered, \"That was the most fantastic election ... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed ... The halls would be filled with people and sitting there in the front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work ... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces ... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on.\"\n\nPearson and his Liberals faltered badly in the campaign. The Liberal Party leader tried to make an issue of the fact that Diefenbaker had called a winter election, generally disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson's objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker's northern plans as \"igloo-to-igloo\" communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done. By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.\n\nOn March 31, 1958, the Tories won what is still the largest majority (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit wiped out. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority of the votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's \"Union Nationale\" political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, \"Union Nationale\" boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.\n\nAn economic downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because of tax cuts instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648 million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led to an increase in the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.\n\nAs a trial lawyer, and in opposition, Diefenbaker had long been concerned with civil liberties. On July 1, 1960, Dominion Day, he introduced the Canadian Bill of Rights in Parliament, and the bill rapidly passed and was proclaimed on August 10, fulfilling a lifetime goal of Diefenbaker's. The document purported to guarantee fundamental freedoms, with special attention to the rights of the accused. However, as a mere piece of federal legislation, it could be amended by any other law, and the question of civil liberties was to a large extent a provincial matter, outside of federal jurisdiction. One lawyer remarked that the document provided rights for all Canadians, \"so long as they don't live in any of the provinces\". Diefenbaker had appointed the first First Nations member of the Senate, James Gladstone in January 1958, and in 1960, his government extended voting rights to all native people.\n\nDiefenbaker pursued a \"One Canada\" policy, seeking equality of all Canadians. As part of that philosophy, he was unwilling to make special concessions to Quebec's francophones. Thomas Van Dusen, who served as Diefenbaker's executive assistant and wrote a book about him, characterized the leader's views on this issue:\nThere must be no compromise with Canada's existence as a nation. Opting out, two flags, two pension plans, associated states, Two Nations and all the other baggage of political dualism was ushering Quebec out of Confederation on the instalment plan. He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, because it would make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.\nDiefenbaker's disinclination to make concessions to Quebec, along with the disintegration of the \"Union Nationale\", the failure of the Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebecers to his Cabinet, none to senior positions, all led to an erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.\n\nBy mid-1961, differences in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne could only be dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, to the dismay of the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank's pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne's pension, without publishing the amendments in the \"Canada Gazette\" as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter's resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought to dismiss Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation to dismiss Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to testify before one of its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding its view that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.\n\nBy the time Diefenbaker called an election for June 18, 1962, the party had been damaged by loss of support in Quebec and in urban areas as voters grew disillusioned with Diefenbaker and the Tories. The PC campaign was hurt when the Bank of Canada was forced to devalue the Canadian dollar to  US cents; it had previously hovered in the range from 95 cents to par with the United States dollar. Privately printed satirical \"Diefenbucks\" swept the country. On election day, the Progressive Conservatives lost 92 seats, but were still able to form a minority government. The New Democratic Party (the successor to the CCF) and Social Credit held the balance of power in the new Parliament.\n\nDiefenbaker attended a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThrough 1959, the Diefenbaker government had a policy of not criticizing South Africa and its apartheid government. In this stance, Diefenbaker had the support of the Liberals but not that of CCF leader Hazen Argue. In 1960, however, the South Africans sought to maintain membership in the Commonwealth even if South African white voters chose to make the country a republic in a referendum scheduled for later that year. South Africa asked that year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference to allow it to remain in the Commonwealth regardless of the result of the referendum. Diefenbaker privately expressed his distaste for apartheid to South African External Affairs Minister Eric Louw and urged him to give the black and coloured people of South Africa at least the minimal representation they had originally had. Louw, attending the conference as Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd recovered from an assassination attempt, refused. The conference resolved that an advance decision would be interfering in South Africa's internal affairs.\n\nOn October 5, 1960, South Africa's white voters decided to make the country a republic. At the Prime Ministers' Conference in 1961, Verwoerd formally applied for South Africa to remain in the Commonwealth. The prime ministers were divided; Diefenbaker broke the deadlock by proposing that the conference not reject South Africa's application, but instead state in a communique that racial equality was a principle of the Commonwealth. This was adopted, although Britain and New Zealand disagreed with Diefenbaker's proposal. South Africa could not accept the communique, and withdrew its application to remain in the Commonwealth. According to Peter Newman, this was \"Diefenbaker's most important contribution to international politics ... Diefenbaker flew home, a hero.\"\n\nAmerican officials were uncomfortable with Diefenbaker's initial election, believing they had heard undertones of anti-Americanism in the campaign. After years of the Liberals, one US State Department official noted, \"We'll be dealing with an unknown quantity.\" Diefenbaker's 1958 landslide was viewed with disappointment by the US officials, who knew and liked Pearson from his years in diplomacy and who felt the Liberal Party leader would be more likely to institute pro-American policies. However, US President Dwight Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. The two men found much in common, from Western farm backgrounds to a love of fishing, and Diefenbaker had an admiration for war leaders such as Eisenhower and Churchill. Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs, \"I might add that President Eisenhower and I were from our first meeting on an 'Ike–John' basis, and that we were as close as the nearest telephone.\" The Eisenhower–Diefenbaker relationship was sufficiently strong that the touchy Canadian Prime Minister was prepared to overlook slights. When Eisenhower addressed Parliament in October 1958, he downplayed trade concerns that Diefenbaker had publicly expressed. Diefenbaker said nothing and took Eisenhower fishing.\n\nDiefenbaker had approved plans to join the United States in what became known as NORAD, an integrated air defence system, in mid-1957. Despite Liberal misgivings that Diefenbaker had committed Canada to the system before consulting either the Cabinet or Parliament, Pearson and his followers voted with the government to approve NORAD in June 1958.\n\nIn 1959, the Diefenbaker government cancelled the development and manufacture of the Avro CF-105 Arrow. The Arrow was a supersonic jet interceptor built by Avro Canada in Malton, Ontario, to defend Canada in the event of a Soviet attack. The interceptor had been under development since 1953, and had suffered from many cost overruns and complications. In 1955, the RCAF stated it would need only nine squadrons of Arrows, down from 20, as originally proposed. According to C. D. Howe, the former minister responsible for postwar reconstruction, the St. Laurent government had serious misgivings about continuing the Arrow program, and planned to discuss its termination after the 1957 election. In the run-up to the 1958 election, with three Tory-held seats at risk in the Malton area, the Diefenbaker government authorized further funding. Even though the first test flights of the Arrow were successful, the US government was unwilling to commit to a purchase of aircraft from Canada. In September 1958, Diefenbaker warned that the Arrow would come under complete review in six months. The company began seeking out other projects including a US-funded \"saucer\" program that became the VZ-9 Avrocar, and also mounted a public relations offensive urging that the Arrow go into full production. On February 20, 1959, the Cabinet decided to cancel the Avro Arrow, following an earlier decision to permit the United States to build two Bomarc missile bases in Canada. The company immediately dismissed its 14,000 employees, blaming Diefenbaker for the firings, though it rehired 2,500 employees to fulfil existing obligations.\n\nAlthough the two leaders had a strong relationship, by 1960 US officials were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked what had become of Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.\n\nThe Kennedy administration began its dealings with Canada badly, with Kennedy mispronouncing Diefenbaker's name in a press conference announcing the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in February 1961. A furious Diefenbaker brought up in Cabinet whether to send a note of protest at the gaffe to Washington; his colleagues were inclined to let the matter pass. When the two met in Washington on February 20, Diefenbaker was impressed by Kennedy, and invited him to visit Ottawa. President Kennedy, however, told his aides that he never wanted \"to see the boring son of a bitch again\". The Ottawa visit also began badly: at the welcome at the airport, Kennedy again mispronounced Diefenbaker's name and stated that after hearing the Prime Minister's (notoriously bad) French, he was uncertain if he should venture into the language (Kennedy's French was equally bad). After meeting with Diefenbaker, Kennedy accidentally left behind a briefing note suggesting he \"push\" Diefenbaker on several issues, including the decision to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, which bitterly divided the Cabinet. Diefenbaker was also annoyed by Kennedy's speech to Parliament, in which he urged Canada to join the OAS (which Diefenbaker had already rejected), and by the President spending most of his time talking to Leader of the Opposition Pearson at the formal dinner. Both Kennedy and his wife Jackie were bored by Diefenbaker's Churchill anecdotes at lunch, stories that Jackie Kennedy later described as \"painful\".\n\nDiefenbaker was initially inclined to go along with Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.\n\nBy 1962, the American government was becoming increasingly concerned at the lack of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.\n\nThough Kennedy was careful to avoid overt favouritism during the 1962 Canadian election campaign, he did allow his pollster, Lou Harris, to work clandestinely for the Liberals. Several times during the campaign, Diefenbaker stated that the Kennedy administration desired his defeat because he refused to \"bow down to Washington\". After Diefenbaker was returned with a minority, Washington continued to press for acceptance of nuclear arms, but Diefenbaker, faced with a split between Defence Minister Douglas Harkness and External Affairs Minister Howard Green on the question, continued to stall, hoping that time and events would invite consensus.\n\nWhen the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962, Kennedy chose not to consult with Diefenbaker before making decisions on what actions to take. The US President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as to the content of the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation and the fact that he was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the US government released a statement stating that it had Canada's full support. In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy's word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Kennedy's actions were widely supported by Canadians. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.\n\nOn January 3, 1963, NATO Supreme Commander General Lauris Norstad visited Ottawa, in one of a series of visits to member nations prior to his retirement. At a news conference, Norstad stated that if Canada did not accept nuclear weapons, it would not be fulfilling its commitments to NATO. Newspapers across Canada criticized Diefenbaker, who was convinced the statement was part of a plot by Kennedy to bring down his government. Although the Liberals had been previously indecisive on the question of nuclear weapons, on January 12, Pearson made a speech stating that the government should live up to the commitments it had made.\n\nWith the Cabinet still divided between adherents of Green and Harkness, Diefenbaker made a speech in the Commons on January 25 that Fleming (by then Minister of Justice) termed \"a model of obfuscation\". Harkness was initially convinced that Diefenbaker was saying that he would support nuclear warheads in Canada. After talking to the press, he realized that his view of the speech was not universally shared, and he asked Diefenbaker for clarification. Diefenbaker, however, continued to try to avoid taking a firm position. On January 30, the US State Department issued a press release suggesting that Diefenbaker had made misstatements in his Commons speech. For the first time ever, Canada recalled its ambassador to Washington as a diplomatic protest. Though all parties condemned the State Department action, the three parties outside the government demanded that Diefenbaker take a stand on the nuclear weapon issue.\n\nThe bitter divisions within the Cabinet continued, with Diefenbaker deliberating whether to call an election on the issue of American interference in Canadian politics. At least six Cabinet ministers favoured Diefenbaker's ouster. Finally, at a dramatic Cabinet meeting on Sunday, February 3, Harkness told Diefenbaker that the Prime Minister no longer had the confidence of the Canadian people, and resigned. Diefenbaker asked ministers supporting him to stand, and when only about half did, stated that he was going to see the Governor General to resign, and that Fleming would be the next Prime Minister. Green called his Cabinet colleagues a \"nest of traitors\", but eventually cooler heads prevailed, and the Prime Minister was urged to return and to fight the motion of non-confidence scheduled for the following day. Harkness, however, persisted in his resignation. Negotiations with the Social Credit Party, which had enough votes to save the government, failed, and the government fell, 142–111.\n\nTwo members of the government resigned the day after the government lost the vote. As the campaign opened, the Tories trailed in the polls by 15 points. To Pearson and his Liberals, the only question was how large a majority they would win. Peter Stursberg, who wrote two books about the Diefenbaker years, stated of that campaign:\nFor the old Diefenbaker was in full cry. All the agony of the disintegration of his government was gone, and he seemed to be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.\nThough the White House maintained public neutrality, privately Kennedy made it clear he desired a Liberal victory. Kennedy lent Lou Harris, his pollster to work for the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories' 95, five seats short of an absolute majority. Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes would be enough to give Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government with the support of the NDP.\n\nDiefenbaker continued to lead the Progressive Conservatives, again as Leader of the Opposition. In November 1963, upon hearing of Kennedy's assassination, the Tory leader addressed the Commons, stating, \"A beacon of freedom has gone. Whatever the disagreement, to me he stood as the embodiment of freedom, not only in his own country, but throughout the world.\" In the 1964 Great Canadian Flag Debate, Diefenbaker led the unsuccessful opposition to the Maple Leaf flag, which the Liberals pushed for after the rejection of Pearson's preferred design showing three maple leaves. Diefenbaker preferred the existing Canadian Red Ensign or another design showing symbols of the nation's heritage. He dismissed the adopted design, with a single red maple leaf and two red bars, as \"a flag that Peruvians might salute\", a reference to Peru's red-white-red tricolour. At the request of Quebec Tory Léon Balcer, who feared devastating PC losses in the province at the next election, Pearson imposed closure, and the bill passed with the majority singing \"O Canada\" as Diefenbaker led the dissenters in \"God Save the Queen\".\n\nIn 1966, the Liberals began to make an issue of the Munsinger affair—two officials of the Diefenbaker government had slept with a woman suspected of being a Soviet spy. In what Diefenbaker saw as a partisan attack, Pearson established a one-man Royal Commission, which, according to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, indulged in \"three months of reckless political inquisition\". By the time the commission issued its report, Diefenbaker and other former ministers had long since withdrawn their counsel from the proceedings. The report faulted Diefenbaker for not dismissing the ministers in question, but found no actual security breach.\n\nThere were calls for Diefenbaker's retirement, especially from the Bay Street wing of the party as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly at the expense of the smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.\n\nIn the absence of a formal leadership review process, Camp was able to stage a de facto review by running for re-election as party president on the platform of holding a leadership convention within a year. His campaign at the Tories' 1966 convention occurred amidst allegations of vote rigging, violence, and seating arrangements designed to ensure that when Diefenbaker addressed the delegates, television viewers would see unmoved delegates in the first ten rows. Other Camp supporters tried to shout Diefenbaker down. Camp was successful in being re-elected thereby forcing a leadership convention for 1967. Diefenbaker initially made no announcement as to whether he would stand, but angered by a resolution at the party's policy conference which spoke of \"\"deux nations\"\" or \"two founding peoples\" (as opposed to Diefenbaker's \"One Canada\"), decided to seek to retain his leadership. Although Diefenbaker entered at the last minute to stand as a candidate for the leadership, he finished fifth on each of the first three ballots, and withdrew from the contest, which was won by Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield.\n\nDiefenbaker addressed the delegates before Stanfield spoke:\n\nMy course has come to an end. I have fought your battles, and you have given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than the party has ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald. In my retiring, I have nothing to withdraw in my desire to see Canada, my country and your country, one nation.\nDiefenbaker was embittered by his loss of the party leadership. Pearson announced his retirement in December 1967, and Diefenbaker forged a wary relationship of mutual respect with Pearson's successor, Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau called a general election for June 1968; Stanfield asked Diefenbaker to join him at a rally in Saskatoon, which Diefenbaker refused, although the two appeared at hastily arranged photo opportunities. Trudeau obtained the majority against Stanfield that Pearson had never been able to obtain against Diefenbaker, as the PC party lost 25 seats, 20 of them in the West. The former Prime Minister, though stating, \"The Conservative Party has suffered a calamitous disaster\" in a CBC interview, could not conceal his delight at Stanfield's humiliation, and especially gloated at the defeat of Camp, who made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Commons. Diefenbaker was easily returned for Prince Albert.\n\nAlthough Stanfield worked to try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved difficult to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on the Official Languages bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader's will or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson died of cancer in 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker shook his head and said only, \"He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize.\"\n\nBy 1972, Diefenbaker had grown disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected comfortably in his home riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of matching the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.\n\nIn the 1976 New Year Honours, Diefenbaker was created a Companion of Honour, an accolade bestowed as the personal gift of the Sovereign. After a long illness, Olive Diefenbaker died on December 22, a loss which plunged Diefenbaker into despair.\n\nJoe Clark succeeded Stanfield as party leader in 1976, but as Clark had supported the leadership review, Diefenbaker held a grudge against him. Diefenbaker had supported Claude Wagner for leader, but when Clark won, stated that Clark would make \"a remarkable leader of this party\". However, Diefenbaker repeatedly criticized his party leader, to such an extent that Stanfield publicly asked Diefenbaker \"to stop sticking a knife into Mr. Clark\"—a request Diefenbaker did not agree to. According to columnist Charles Lynch, Diefenbaker regarded Clark as an upstart and a pipsqueak.\n\nIn 1978, Diefenbaker announced that he would stand in one more election, and under the slogan \"Diefenbaker—Now More Than Ever\", weathered a campaign the following year during which he apparently suffered a mild stroke, although the media were told he was bedridden with influenza. In the May election Diefenbaker defeated NDP candidate Stan Hovdebo (who, after Diefenbaker's death, would win the seat in a by-election) by 4,000 votes. Clark had defeated Trudeau, though only gaining a minority government, and Diefenbaker returned to Ottawa to witness the swearing-in, still unreconciled to his old opponents among Clark's ministers. Two months later, Diefenbaker died of a heart attack in his study about a month before his 84th birthday.\n\nDiefenbaker had extensively planned his funeral in consultation with government officials. He lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament for two and a half days; 10,000 Canadians passed by his casket. The Maple Leaf Flag on the casket was partially obscured by the Red Ensign. After the service, his body was taken by train on a slow journey to its final destination, Saskatoon; along the route, many Canadians lined the tracks to watch the funeral train pass. In Winnipeg, an estimated 10,000 people waited at midnight in a one-kilometre line to file past the casket which made the trip draped in a Canadian flag and Diefenbaker's beloved Red Ensign. In Prince Albert, thousands of those he had represented filled the square in front of the railroad station to salute the only man from Saskatchewan ever to become Prime Minister. His coffin was accompanied by that of his wife Olive, disinterred from temporary burial in Ottawa. Prime Minister Clark delivered the eulogy, paying tribute to \"an indomitable man, born to a minority group, raised in a minority region, leader of a minority party, who went on to change the very nature of his country, and change it forever\". John and Olive Diefenbaker rest outside the Diefenbaker Centre, built to house his papers, on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nSome of Diefenbaker's policies did not survive the 16 years of Liberal government that followed his fall. By the end of 1963, the first of the Bomarc warheads entered Canada, where they remained until the last were finally phased out during John Turner's brief government in 1984. Diefenbaker's decision to have Canada remain outside the OAS was not reversed by Pearson, and it was not until 1989, under the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, that Canada joined.\n\nBut several defining features of modern Canada can be traced back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death.\n\nSince his death, Diefenbaker has had several locations named in his honour, particularly in his home province of Saskatchewan, including Lake Diefenbaker, the largest lake in Southern Saskatchewan, and the Diefenbaker Bridge in Prince Albert. In 1993, Saskatoon renamed its airport the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport. The city of Prince Albert continues to maintain the house he resided in from 1947 to 1975 as a public museum known as Diefenbaker House; it was designated a National Historic Site in 2018.\n\nDiefenbaker reinvigorated a moribund party system in Canada. Clark and Mulroney, two men who, as students, worked on and were inspired by his 1957 triumph, became the only other Progressive Conservatives to lead the party to election triumphs. Diefenbaker's biographer, Denis Smith, wrote of him, \"In politics he had little more than two years of success in the midst of failure and frustration, but he retained a core of deeply committed loyalists to the end of his life and beyond. The federal Conservative Party that he had revived remained dominant in the prairie provinces for 25 years after he left the leadership.\" The Harper government, believing that Tory prime ministers have been given short shrift in the naming of Canadian places and institutions, named the former Ottawa City Hall, now a federal office building, the John G. Diefenbaker Building. It also gave Diefenbaker's name to a human rights award and an icebreaking vessel. Harper often invoked Diefenbaker's northern vision in his speeches.\n\nConservative Senator Marjory LeBreton worked in Diefenbaker's office during his second time as Opposition Leader, and has said of him, \"He brought a lot of firsts to Canada, but a lot of it has been air-brushed from history by those who followed.\" Historian Michael Bliss, who published a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers, wrote of Diefenbaker:\n\nFrom the distance of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced in the form of significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values ... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.\nDiefenbaker received several honorary degrees in recognition of his political career:\n\n! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Location !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Date !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:40%;\" School !! style=\"background:#f5f5f5; width:20%;\" Degree\n\nBULLET::::- List of people from Prince Albert\nBULLET::::- Diefenbunker\nBULLET::::- \"Dief Will Be the Chief Again\"\n\nBULLET::::- (fee for article)\n\nBULLET::::- Hilliker, John. \"The Politicians and the 'Pearsonalities': The Diefenbaker Government and the Conduct of Canadian External Relations\", in \"Canadian Foreign Policy: Historical Readings\" ed.

{"id": "15916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15916", "title": "Jean-Michel Basquiat", "text": "Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat (; December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist of Haitian and Puerto Rican descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of SAMO, an informal graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s, where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop music culture. By the 1980s, his neo-expressionist paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992.\n\nBasquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.\n\nBasquiat used social commentary in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of racism. Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle. He died of a heroin overdose at his art studio at the age of 27. On May 18, 2017, at a Sotheby's auction, a 1982 painting by Basquiat depicting a black skull with red and black rivulets (\"Untitled\") set a new record high for any American artist at auction, selling for $110.5 million. Basquiat's art has inspired many in the hip hop music community such as Jay-Z.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1960, shortly after the death of his older brother, Max. He was the second of four children of Matilde Basquiat (née Andrades) (July 28, 1934 – November 17, 2008) and Gérard Basquiat (1930 – July 7, 2013). He had two younger sisters: Lisane, born in 1964, and Jeanine, born in 1967.\n\nHis father, Gérard Basquiat, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and his mother, Matilde Basquiat, who was of Puerto Rican descent, was born in Brooklyn, New York. Matilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to art museums in Manhattan and enrolling him as a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Basquiat was a precocious child who learned how to read and write by the age of four and was a gifted artist. His teachers, including artist José Machado, noticed his artistic abilities, and his mother encouraged her son's artistic talent. By the age of 11, Basquiat was fully fluent in French, Spanish and English. In 1967, Basquiat started attending Saint Ann's School, an arts-oriented exclusive private school. There he met his friend Marc Prozzo; together they created a children's book, written by Basquiat and illustrated by Prozzo. Basquiat became an avid reader of Spanish, French, and English texts and a good athlete, competing in track events.\n\nIn September 1968, at the age of seven, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street. His arm was broken and he suffered several internal injuries; he eventually underwent a splenectomy. While he was recuperating from his injuries, his mother brought him a copy of \"Gray's Anatomy\" to keep him occupied. This book would prove to be influential in his future artistic outlook. His parents separated that year and he and his sisters were raised by their father. The family resided in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, for five years, then moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1974, where Basquiat studied at Saint John's School in Condado. After two years, they returned to New York City.\n\nWhen he was 13, his mother was committed to a mental institution and thereafter spent her life in and out of institutions. Due to his mother's instability and family unrest, at 15 Basquiat ran away from home. He slept on park benches in Tompkins Square Park, and was arrested and returned to the care of his father within a week. Basquiat dropped out of Edward R. Murrow High School in the 10th grade at the age of 17 and then attended City-As-School, an alternative high school in Manhattan, home to many artistic students who failed at conventional schooling. His father banished him from the household for dropping out of high school and Basquiat stayed with friends in Brooklyn. He supported himself by selling T-shirts and homemade post cards.\n\n Basquiat's transition from being homeless and unemployed to becoming a prosperous artist took place in a short space of time. By 1980, he would be selling a single painting for up to $25,000. In 1976, Basquiat and his friend Al Diaz began spray painting graffiti on buildings in Lower Manhattan, working under the pseudonym SAMO. The designs featured inscribed messages within his Untitled works such as \"Plush safe he think... SAMO (sic)\" and \"SAMO as an escape clause\". In 1978, Basquiat worked for the Unique Clothing Warehouse in their art department at 718 Broadway in NoHo, and at night he continued using the pseudonym \"SAMO\", painting his original graffiti art on neighborhood buildings. Unique's founder Harvey Russack discovered Basquiat painting a building one night, they became friends, and he offered him a day job. On December 11, 1978, \"The Village Voice\" published an article about the graffiti. When Basquiat and Diaz ended their friendship, the SAMO project ended with the epitaph \"SAMO IS DEAD\", inscribed on the walls of SoHo buildings in 1979.\nIn 1979, Basquiat appeared on the live public-access television show \"TV Party\" hosted by Glenn O'Brien, and the two started a friendship. Basquiat made regular appearances on the show over the next few years. That same year, Basquiat formed the noise rock band Test Pattern – which was later renamed Gray – which played at Arleen Schloss's open space, \"Wednesdays at A's\". In October 1979, at the same club, Basquiat showed his SAMO montages using color Xerox copies of his works.\n\nOther members of Gray included Shannon Dawson, Michael Holman, Nick Taylor, Wayne Clifford and Vincent Gallo, and the band performed at nightclubs such as Max's Kansas City, CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club. In 1980, Basquiat starred in O'Brien's independent film \"Downtown 81\", originally titled \"New York Beat\". That same year, Basquiat met Andy Warhol at a restaurant. Basquiat presented to Warhol samples of his work, and Warhol was stunned by Basquiat's \"mystique and allure.\" The two artists later collaborated. \"Downtown 81\" featured some of Gray's recordings on its soundtrack. Basquiat also appeared in the 1981 Blondie music video \"Rapture,\" in a role originally intended for Grandmaster Flash, as a nightclub disc jockey.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, Basquiat made his breakthrough as a solo artist. In June 1980, Basquiat participated in \"The Times Square Show\", a multi-artist exhibition sponsored by Collaborative Projects Incorporated (Colab) and Fashion Moda where he was noticed by various critics and curators. In particular Emilio Mazzoli, an Italian gallerist, saw the exhibition and invited Basquiat to Modena (Italy) to have his world first solo show, that opened on May 23, 1981. In December 1981, Rene Ricard published \"The Radiant Child\" in \"Artforum\" magazine. At this time, Basquiat painted many pieces on found objects, such as discarded doors.\n\nIn March 1982, he painted in Modena, Italy, for his second Italian exhibition. Starting in November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California home. There, Basquiat commenced a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery which was then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then-unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, \"Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and we were having a lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, 'My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.' I was a little concerned–one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, 'Well, what's she like?' And he said, 'Her name is Madonna and she's going to be huge.' I'll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.\" During this time, Basquiat took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter.\nIn late 1981, Basquiat met Annina Nosei with his first exhibition in her gallery in a group show called Public Address with Keith Haring and Barbara Kruger among others, and he joined the Annina Nosei gallery and worked in a basement below the gallery toward his first American one-man show from March 6 to April 1, 1982. At the time, and while dating others, Basquiat was living with his girlfriend (from 1981 to 1983), Suzanne Mallouk, who later specifically described his sexuality in Jennifer Clement's book, \"Widow Basquiat\", as: \"... not monochromatic. It did not rely on visual stimulation, such as a pretty girl. It was a very rich multichromatic sexuality. He was attracted to people for all different reasons. They could be boys, girls, thin, fat, pretty, ugly. It was, I think, driven by intelligence. He was attracted to intelligence more than anything and to pain.\"\n\nIn 1983, Basquiat produced a 12-inch rap single featuring hip-hop artists Rammellzee and K-Rob. Billed as Rammellzee vs. K-Rob, the single contained two versions of the same track: \"Beat Bop\" on the A-side with vocals, with the B-side adding an instrumental version. The single was pressed in limited quantities on the one-off Tartown Record Company label. The single's cover featured Basquiat's artwork, making the pressing highly desirable among both record and art collectors. A large number of photographs depict a 2-3 year collaboration between Warhol and Basquiat from 1983 and 1985 which included \"Olympic Rings\" (1985), in which Warhol made some Olympic five-ring symbols rendered in the original primary colors and which Basquiat stylized with his graffiti style. Basquiat often painted in expensive Armani suits; and he would even appear in public in the same paint-splattered clothes.\n\nBy 1986, Basquiat had left the Annina Nosei gallery and was showing at the Mary Boone gallery in SoHo. On February 10, 1985, he appeared on the cover of \"The New York Times Magazine\" in a feature titled \"New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist\". In spite of his artistic success in this period, his emotional instability continued to haunt him and caused him to begin to use heroin frequently. Many of his peers speculated that his heroin use was a means of coping with the demands of his newfound fame, the exploitative nature of the art industry, and the pressures of being a black man in the white-dominated art world.\n\nFollowing his return from a trip to Hawaii in the last year of his life, Keith Haring reports meeting with Basquiat who was glad to tell Haring that he had finally kicked his dependence on drugs. Despite attempts at sobriety, he died on August 12, 1988, of a heroin overdose at his art studio on Great Jones Street in Manhattan's NoHo neighborhood. He was 27 years old.\n\nBasquiat was interred in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery, where Jeffrey Deitch made a graveside speech. Among those speaking at Basquiat's memorial held at Saint Peter's Church on November 3, 1988, was Ingrid Sischy who, as the editor of \"Artforum\" in the 1980s, got to know the artist well and commissioned a number of articles that introduced his work to the wider world. Suzanne Mallouk recited sections of A. R. Penck's \"Poem for Basquiat\" and Fab 5 Freddy read a poem by Langston Hughes. The 300 guests included musicians John Lurie and Arto Lindsay; artist Keith Haring; poet David Shapiro; Glenn O'Brien, a writer; Fab 5 Freddy; and members of the band Gray, which Basquiat led in the late 1970s. In memory of the late artist, Keith Haring created \"Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat\" (1988). In his memorial words for Basquiat, Haring stated: \"He truly created a lifetime of works in ten years. Greedily, we wonder what else he might have created, what masterpieces we have been cheated out of by his death, but the fact is that he has created enough work to intrigue generations to come. Only now will people begin to understand the magnitude of his contribution\".\n\nAccording to Franklin Sirmans, Basquiat appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that underlying Basquiat's self-identification as an artist was his \"innate capacity to function as something like an oracle, distilling his perceptions of the outside world down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative acts.\" Additionally, continuing his activities as a graffiti artist, Basquiat often incorporated words into his paintings. Before his career as a painter began, he produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for the political–poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. On one occasion Basquiat painted his girlfriend's dress with the words \"Little Shit Brown\". He would often draw on random objects and surfaces, including other people's property. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of Basquiat's art. His paintings are typically covered with text and codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, diagrams and more.\n\nBasquiat's art focused on recurrent \"suggestive dichotomies\", such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. A middle period from late 1982 to 1985 featured multi-panel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars, the surface dense with writing, collage and imagery. The years 1984–85 were also the main period of the Basquiat–Warhol collaborations, even if, in general, they were not very well received by the critics. A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book \"Gray's Anatomy\", which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital aged seven. It remained influential in his depictions of internal human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text. Other major sources were Henry Dreyfuss' \"Symbol Sourcebook\", Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Burchard Brentjes' \"African Rock Art\".\n\nA prominent theme in the early Basquiat portrayed historically prominent black figures, such as Charlie Parker, who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. These were often identified with the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in Basquiat's specially chosen pantheon. As the \"Art Daily\" described Basquiat's show in the Bilbao Guggenheim: \"The show is divided into eight different sections on the Museum's third floor and begins in Gallery 305, where his earliest creations are displayed under two themes: “Street as Studio” and “Heroes and Saints”. The urban landscape inspired the subject matter, approach, and materials used in these pieces\".\n\nIn his short career, Basquiat produced around 1500 drawings, as well as around 600 paintings and many sculpture and mixed media works. Basquiat drew constantly, and often used objects around him as surfaces when paper was not immediately at hand. Since childhood, Basquiat produced cartoon-inspired drawings when encouraged by his mother's interest in art, and drawing became a part of his expression as an artist. Basquiat's drawings were produced in many different media, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick. Basquiat sometimes used Xerox copies of fragments of his drawings to paste on to the canvas of larger paintings.\n\nThe first public showing of Basquiat's paintings and drawings was in 1981: New York/New Wave, at PS1 in Long Island City, brought together by Mudd Club co-founder and curator Diego Cortez. It was a group show that included pieces by William Burroughs, David Byrne, Keith Haring, Nan Goldin and Robert Mapplethorpe. The article in \"Artforum\" magazine entitled \"Radiant Child\" written by Rene Ricard after seeing the show at PS1, brought Basquiat to the attention of the art world. In 1984 Basquiat immortalised Ricard in two drawings, \"Untitled (Axe/Rene)\" and \"Rene Ricard\", representing the tension that existed between them.\n\nA poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York including other artists, and black historical figures, musicians and sports stars, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate. Often Basquiat's drawings were untitled, and as such to differentiate works a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after \"Untitled\", such as with \"Untitled (Axe/Rene)\". After Basquiat died of an overdose at the age of 27, his estate was controlled by his father Gérard Basquiat, who also oversaw the committee which authenticated artworks, and operated from 1993 to 2012 to review over 1000 works, the majority of which were drawings.\n\nHeads and skulls are seen as significant focal points of many of Basquiat's most seminal works. Two pieces, \"Untitled (Scull/Skull, 1981)\" and \"Untitled (Head, 1982)\", held by the Broad Foundation and Maezawa Foundation, respectively, can be seen as primary examples. In reference to the potent image depicted in both pieces, Fred Hoffman writes that Basquiat was likely, \"caught off guard, possibly even frightened, by the power and energy emanating from this unexpected image.\" Further investigation by Fred Hoffman of pieces like \"Masonic Lodge\" 1983 and \"Untitled\" (1983) in his book \"The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat\" reveals a deeper interest in the artist's fascination with heads that proves an evolution in the artist's oeuvre from one of raw power to one of more refined cognizance.\n\nAccording to Andrea Frohne, Basquiat's painting \"Untitled (History of the Black People, 1983)\" \"reclaims Egyptians as African and subverts the concept of ancient Egypt as the cradle of Western Civilization\". At the center of the painting, Basquiat depicts an Egyptian boat being guided down the Nile River by Osiris, the Egyptian god of the earth and vegetation. On the right panel of the painting appear the words \"Esclave, Slave, Esclave\". Two letters of the word \"Nile\" are crossed out and Frohne suggests that, \"The letters that are wiped out and scribbled over perhaps reflect the acts of historians who have conveniently forgotten that Egyptians were black and blacks were enslaved.\" On the left panel of the painting Basquiat has illustrated two Nubian-style masks. The Nubians historically were darker in skin color, and were considered to be slaves by the Egyptian people. Throughout the rest of the painting, images of the Atlantic slave trade are juxtaposed alongside images of the Egyptian slave trade centuries before. The sickle in the center panel is a direct reference to the slave trade in the United States, and slave labor under the plantation system. The word \"salt\" that appears on the right panel of the work refers to the Atlantic slave trade, as salt was another important commodity traded at that time.\n\nAnother of Basquiat's pieces, \"Irony of Negro Policeman\" (1981), is intended to illustrate how he believes African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly Caucasian society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the \"institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power\" years after the Jim Crow era had ended. This concept has been reiterated in additional Basquiat works, including his titled Created Equal. However Basquiat found the idea of the “negro policeman” specifically ironic. The hat that frames the head of the Negro policeman resembles a cage, and represents what Basquiat believes are the constrained independent perceptions of African Americans at the time, and how constrained the policeman's own perceptions were within white society. Basquiat drew upon his Haitian heritage by painting a hat that resembles the top hat associated with the ' family of ', who embody the powers of death in Vodou. However, Kellie Jones, in her essay \"Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the (Re)Mix\", posits that Basquiat's \"mischievous, complex, and neologistic side, with regard to the fashioning of modernity and the influence and effluence of black culture\" are often elided by critics and viewers, and thus \"lost in translation.\" The art historian Olivier Berggruen situates in Basquiat's anatomical screen prints, titled \"Anatomy,\" an assertion of vulnerability, one which \"creates an aesthetic of the body as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, it is the very act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity.\"\n\nTraditionally, the interpretation of Basquiat's works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, the figures in his paintings, as stated by Stephen Metcalf, \"are shown frontally, with little or no depth of field, and nerves and organs are exposed, as in an anatomy textbook. Are these creatures dead and being clinically dissected, one wonders, or alive and in immense pain?\" In a similar vein, Jordana Moore Saggese states the action represented in the paintings of Basquiat have been referred to as a tribute to jazz indicating that, \"Parker, Gillespie, and the other musicians of the bebop era infamously appropriated both the harmonic structures of jazz standards, using them as a structure for their own songs, and repeated similar note patterns across several improvisations.\"\n\nA second recurrent reference to Basquiat's aesthetics comes from the artist intention to share, in the words of Niru Ratnum, a \"highly individualistic, expressive view of the world\". David Bowie, a collector of Basquiat's works, stated that \"He seemed to digest the frenetic flow of passing image and experience, put them through some kind of internal reorganization and dress the canvas with this resultant network of chance.\" Basquiat seems to invite us to, in the words of Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo, \"paint like a child, don't paint what is on the surface... Finally every energy you drop is marking a territory, is a traffic sign, is directing and feeding spirits. What seems like a mess for some of us in the Cartesian logic, it is maybe a clear spiritual route for some others.\" Fred Hoffman stated that a painting from Basquiat typically \"shows the artist's vitality and energy being continually challenged by life-draining organisms.\" Reviews about his work have been written on the direct relation of painting and graffiti. Regarding the relation between painting and graffiti, Olivia Laing states: \"Words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning.\"\n\nIn the words of the Marc Mayer essay \"Basquiat in History\", \"Basquiat speaks articulately while dodging the full impact of clarity like a matador. We can read his pictures without strenuous effort—the words, the images, the colors and the construction—but we cannot quite fathom the point they belabor. Keeping us in this state of half-knowing, of mystery-within-familiarity, had been the core technique of his brand of communication since his adolescent days as the graffiti poet SAMO. To enjoy them, we are not meant to analyze the pictures too carefully. Quantifying the encyclopedic breadth of his research certainly results in an interesting inventory, but the sum cannot adequately explain his pictures, which requires an effort outside the purview of iconography ... he painted a calculated incoherence, calibrating the mystery of what such apparently meaning-laden pictures might ultimately mean.\"\n\nBasquiat's first public exhibition in June 1980 was in the group effort \"The Times Square Show\" (with David Hammons, Jenny Holzer, Lee Quiñones, Kenny Scharf and Kiki Smith among others), held in a vacant building at 41st Street and Seventh Avenue, New York. In late 1981, Basquiat joined the Annina Nosei gallery in SoHo; his first one-person exhibition was in 1982 at that gallery. By then, he was showing regularly alongside other Neo-expressionist artists including Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi. He was represented in Los Angeles by the Gagosian gallery and throughout Europe by Bruno Bischofberger.\n\nMajor exhibitions of Basquiat's work have included \"Jean-Michel Basquiat: Paintings 1981–1984\" at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (1984), which traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, in 1985; the two exhibits at Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover (1987, 1989). The first retrospective to be held of his work was the \"Jean-Michel Basquiat\" exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art from October 1992 to February 1993. It subsequently traveled to the Menil Collection, Houston; the Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, Alabama, from 1993 to 1994. The catalog for this exhibition, was edited by Richard Marshall and included several essays of different perspectives. Another exhibition, \"Basquiat\", was mounted by the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in 2005, and traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. From October 2006 to January 2007, the first Basquiat exhibition in Puerto Rico took place at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (MAPR), produced by ArtPremium, Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici.\n\n\"Basquait and the Bayou\", a 2014 show presented by the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans, focused on the artist's works with themes of the American South. Brooklyn Museum exhibited \"Basquiat: The Unknown Notebooks\" in April–August 2015. In 2017, the Barbican Centre in London exhibited \"Basquiat: Boom for Real\". Basquiat remains an important source of inspiration for a younger generation of contemporary artists all over the world such as Rita Ackermann and Kader Attia, as shown, for example, at the exhibition \"Street and Studio: From Basquiat to Séripop\" co-curated by Cathérine Hug and Thomas Mießgang and previously exhibited at Kunsthalle Wien (Austria) in 2010.\n\nThe Brant Foundation in its Art Study Center from March 6 to May 15, 2019 hosted an extensive exhibit of Basquiat's works with free admission, where all tickets were claimed for its full six weeks in advance of the opening of the exhibit. In June 2019, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York presents \"Basquiat's \"Defacement\": The Untold Story\"\n\nIn a review for \"The Telegraph\", critic Hilton Kramer begins his first paragraph by stating that Basquiat had no idea what the word \"quality\" meant. The criticisms to follow relentlessly label Basquiat as a \"talentless hustler\" and a \"street-smart but otherwise invincibly ignorant\" arguing that art dealers of the time were \"as ignorant about art as Basquiat himself.\" In saying that Jean-Michel's work never rose above \"that lowly artistic station\" of graffiti \"even when his paintings were fetching enormous prices,\" Kramer argued that graffiti art \"acquired a cult status in certain New York art circles.\" Kramer further opined that \"As a result of the campaign waged by these art-world entrepreneurs on Basquiat's behalf—and their own, of course—there was never any doubt that the museums, the collectors and the media would fall into line\" when talking about the marketization of Basquiat's name.\n\nAccording to Sirmans, Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle. As reviewed by Hoffman, Basquiat used social commentary in his paintings as a \"springboard to deeper truths about the individual\". Art critic Bonnie Rosenberg compares Basquiat's work to the emergence of American Hip Hop during the same era. She also mentions how Basquiat experienced a good taste of fame in his last years when he was a \"critically embraced and popularly celebrated artistic phenomenon.\" Rosenberg remarked that some people focused on the \"superficial exoticism of his work\" missing the fact that it \"held important connections to expressive precursors.\" Shortly after his death, \"The New York Times\" indicated that Basquiat was \"the most famous of only a small number of young black artists who have achieved national recognition.\"\n\nNotable private collectors of Basquiat's work include David Bowie, Mera and Donald Rubell, Lars Ulrich, Steven A. Cohen, Laurence Graff, John McEnroe, Madonna, Debbie Harry, Leonardo DiCaprio, Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z, and Johnny Depp. Basquiat sold his first painting in 1981, and by 1982, spurred by the Neo-Expressionist art boom, his work was in great demand. Basquiat was on the cover of \"The New York Times Magazine\" in 1985 which was unprecedented for any young African-American artist. Since Basquiat's death in 1988, the market for his work has developed steadily—in line with overall art market trends—with a dramatic peak in 2007 when, at the height of the art market boom, the global auction volume for his work was over $115 million. Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie's, is quoted describing Basquiat's market as \"two-tiered. ... The most coveted material is rare, generally dating from the best period, 1981–83.\"\n\nIn 2001 New York artist and con-artist Alfredo Martinez was charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with attempting to deceive two art dealers by selling them $185,000 worth of fake Basquiat drawings. The charges against Martinez, which landed him in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correction Center on June 19, 2002, involved an alleged scheme to sell fake Basquiat drawings, accompanied by forged certificates of authenticity. Until 2002, the highest amount paid for an original work of Basquiat's was US$3,302,500, set on November 12, 1998, at Christie's. In 2002, Basquiat's \"Profit I\" (1982), a large piece measuring , was set for auction again at Christie's by drummer Lars Ulrich of the heavy metal band Metallica. It sold for US$5,509,500. The proceedings of the auction are documented in the film \"\".\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012, the price of Basquiat artwork continued to steady grow up to $16.3 million dollars. In 2013, Basquiat's piece \"Dustheads\" sold for $48.8 million at Christie's. In 2016 an untitled piece sold at Christie's for $57.3 million to a Japanese businessman and collector, Yusaku Maezawa. In 2017, Yusaku purchased Basquiat's \"Untitled\" (1982), a powerful depiction of a black skull with red and black rivulets, at auction for a record-setting US$110,487,500—the most ever paid for an American artwork and the sixth most expensive artwork sold at an auction, surpassing Andy Warhol's \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" which sold in 2013 for $105 million. Maezawa's two record breaking purchases of Basquiat artworks in 2016 and 2017 total $170M USD.\n\nThe authentication committee of the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat was formed by the gallery that was assigned to handle the artist's estate and was dissolved in 2012. Between 1994 and 2012, it reviewed over 2,000 works of art; the cost of the committee's opinion was $100. The committee was headed by Gérard Basquiat. Members and advisers varied depending on who was available at the time when a piece was being authenticated, but they have included the curators and gallerists Diego Cortez, Jeffrey Deitch, John Cheim, Richard Marshall, Fred Hoffman and Annina Nosei (the artist's first art dealer).\n\nIn 2008 the authentication committee was sued by collector Gerard De Geer, who claimed the committee breached its contract by refusing to offer an opinion on the authenticity of the painting \"Fuego Flores\" (1983); after the lawsuit was dismissed, the committee ruled the work genuine. In early 2012, the committee announced that it would dissolve in September of that year and no longer consider applications.\n\nBasquiat's legacy has had influences upon literature, film, music, and fashion. Fashion outlets featuring Basquiat's work have included clothing companies such as SPRZ NY of Uniqlo, Urban Outfitters, and Redbubble.\n\nBasquiat starred in \"Downtown 81\", a \"vérité\" movie written by Glenn O'Brien and shot by Edo Bertoglio in 1981, but not released until 1998. In 1996, eight years after the artist's death, a biographical film titled \"Basquiat\" was released, directed by Julian Schnabel, with actor Jeffrey Wright playing Basquiat. David Bowie played the part of Andy Warhol. Schnabel was interviewed during the film's script development as a personal acquaintance of Basquiat. Schnabel then purchased the rights to the project, believing that he could make a better film.\n\nIn 2006 the Equality Forum featured Jean-Michel Basquiat during LGBT history month. A 2009 documentary film, \"\", directed by Tamra Davis, was first screened as part of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and was shown on the PBS series \"Independent Lens\" in 2011. Tamra Davis discussed her friendship with Basquiat in a Sotheby's video, \"Basquiat: Through the Eyes of a Friend\". The American Public Broadcast Service broadcast a 90-minute documentary about Basquiat in the \"American Masters\" series, entitled \"Basquiat: Rage to Riches\", on 14 September 2018.\n\nIn 1991, poet Kevin Young produced a book, \"To Repel Ghosts\", a compendium of 117 poems relating to Basquiat's life, individual paintings, and social themes found in the artist's work. He published a \"remix\" of the book in 2005. In 1995, writer Jennifer Clement wrote the biography \"Widow Basquiat\", based on the narratives' reconstructions told to her by Suzanne Mallouk. In 2005, poet M. K. Asante published the poem \"SAMO\", dedicated to Basquiat, in his book \"Beautiful. And Ugly Too\". In 2017, the biography \"Radiant Child\" told Basquiat's life from the perspective of a young prodigy and it won the Caldecott Medal. In 2019, illustrator Paolo Parisi wrote the graphic novel \"Basquiat: A Graphic Novel\", following Basquiat's journey from street-art legend SAMO to international art-scene darling, up until his sudden death.\n\nShortly after Basquiat's death, guitarist Vernon Reid of New York City funk metal band Living Colour wrote a song called \"Desperate People\", released on their album \"Vivid\". The song primarily addresses the drug scene of New York at that time. Vernon states that Basquiat's death inspired him to write the song after receiving a phone call from Greg Tate informing Vernon of Basquiat's death.\nBULLET::::- Buchhart, Dieter, Glenn O'Brien, Jean-Louis Prat, Susanne Reichling. \"Jean-Michel Basquiat\", Hatje Cantz, 2010.\nBULLET::::- Buchhart, Dieter, and Eleanor Nairne. \"Basquiat: Boom for Real\".

{"id": "15918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15918", "title": "John Graves Simcoe", "text": "John Graves Simcoe\n\nJohn Graves Simcoe (25 February 1752 – 26 October 1806) was a British Army general and the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada from 1791 until 1796 in southern Ontario and the watersheds of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior. He founded York (now Toronto) and was instrumental in introducing institutions such as courts of law, trial by jury, English common law, and freehold land tenure, and also in the abolition of slavery in Canada.\n\nHis long-term goal was the development of Upper Canada (Ontario) as a model community built on aristocratic and conservative principles, designed to demonstrate the superiority of those principles to the Republicanism and democracy of the United States. His energetic efforts were only partially successful in establishing a local gentry, a thriving Church of England, and an anti-American coalition with select Indigenous nations. He is seen by many Canadians as a founding figure in Canadian history, especially by those in Southern Ontario. He is commemorated in Toronto with Simcoe Day.\n\nSimcoe was the only surviving son of Cornishman John (1710–1759) and Katherine Simcoe (d. 1767). His parents had four children, but he was the only one to live past childhood; Percy drowned in 1764, while Paulet William and John William died as infants. His father was a captain in the Royal Navy who commanded the 60-gun HMS \"Pembroke\" during the Siege of Louisbourg (1758), with James Cook as his sailing master. He died of pneumonia on 15 May 1759 on board his ship in the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River a few months prior to the siege of Quebec, and was buried at sea. The family then moved to his mother's parental home in Exeter. His paternal grandparents were William and Mary (née Hutchinson) Simcoe.\n\nHe was educated at Exeter Grammar School and Eton College. He spent a year at Merton College, Oxford; he was then admitted to Lincoln's Inn, but decided to follow the military career for which his father had intended him. He was initiated into Freemasonry in Union Lodge, Exeter on 2 November 1773.\n\nIn 1770, Simcoe entered the British Army as an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot, and his unit was dispatched to the Thirteen Colonies. Later, he saw action in the American Revolutionary War during the Siege of Boston. After the siege, in July 1776, he was promoted captain in the 40th Regiment of Foot. He saw action with the grenadier company of the 40th Foot in the New York and New Jersey campaign and the Philadelphia campaign. Simcoe commanded the 40th at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, where he was wounded. Legend has it that Simcoe ordered his men at Brandywine not to fire upon three fleeing rebels, among whom was George Washington.\n\nIn 1777, Simcoe sought to form a Loyalist regiment of free blacks from Boston but instead was offered the command of the Queen's Rangers formed on Staten Island on 15 October 1777. It was a well-trained light infantry unit comprising 11 companies of 30 men, 1 grenadier, and 1 hussar, and the rest light infantry. The Queen's Rangers saw extensive action during the Philadelphia campaign, including a successful surprise attack (planned and executed by Simcoe) at the Battle of Crooked Billet.\n\nIn 1778, Simcoe led an attack on Judge William Hancock's house during a foraging expedition opposed by Patriot militia. The attack killed 10 militiamen in their sleep and wounded five others. William Hancock was also killed, although he was not with the Americans. The attack took place at night and with bayonets. On 28 June of that year, Simcoe and his Queen's Rangers took part in the Battle of Monmouth, in and near Freehold, New Jersey.\n\nOn August 31, 1778, Lieut. Col. Simcoe led a massacre of forty Native Americans, allied with the Continental Army, in what is today the Bronx, NY. This place is known as Indian Field in Van Cortlandt Park, Bronx. NY.\n\nOn October 26, 1779, Simcoe and 80 men launched an attack on central New Jersey from southern Staten Island known as Simcoe's Raid, from what is known today as the Conference House, resulting in the burning of Patriot supplies inside a Dutch Reformed Church in Finderne, including hay and grain; the release of Loyalist prisoners from the Somerset County Courthouse; and Simcoe's capture by Armand Tuffin de La Rouërie. Simcoe was released at the end of 1779 and rejoined his unit in Virginia. He participated in the Raid on Richmond with Benedict Arnold in January, 1781 and was involved in a skirmish near Williamsburg and was at the Siege of Yorktown. He was invalided back to England in December of that year as a Lieutenant-Colonel, having been promoted in March 1782.\n\nSimcoe wrote a book on his experiences with the Queen's Rangers, titled \"A Journal of the Operations of the Queen's Rangers from the end of the year 1777 to the conclusion of the late American War\", which was published in 1787.\n\nSimcoe convalesced at the Devon home of his godfather, Admiral Samuel Graves. In 1782, Simcoe married Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim, his godfather's ward. Elizabeth was a wealthy heiress, who acquired a estate at Honiton in Devon and built Wolford Lodge. Wolford was the Simcoe family seat until 1923.\n\nThe Simcoes had five daughters before their posting in Canada. Son Francis was born in 1791. Their Canadian-born daughter, Katherine, died in infancy in York. She is buried in the Victoria Square Memorial Park on Portland Avenue, Toronto. Francis returned with his father to England when his tenure expired and joined the army. He was killed in an infantry charge during the Peninsular War in 1812.\n\nSon Henry Addington Simcoe became an English theologian.\n\nSimcoe entered politics in 1790. He was elected Member of Parliament for St Mawes in Cornwall, as a supporter of the government (led by William Pitt the Younger). As MP, he proposed raising a militia force like the Queen's Rangers. He also proposed to lead an invasion of Spain. But instead he was to be made lieutenant governor of the new loyalist province of Upper Canada. He resigned from Parliament in 1792 on taking up his new post.\n\nThe Constitutional Act 1791 divided Canada into the Provinces of Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec). The Act established separate governments and legislative assemblies for each province. Lower Canada was the French-speaking eastern portion, which retained the French civil law and protections for the Roman Catholic Church established when Britain took over the area after its defeat of the French in the Seven Years' War. Upper Canada was the western area, newly settled after the American Revolutionary War. The settlers were mostly English speakers, including Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies, and also the Six Nations of the Iroquois, who had been British allies during the war. The Crown had purchased land from the Mississauga and other First Nations to give the Loyalists land grants in partial compensation for property lost in the United States, and to help them set up new communities and develop this territory.\n\nSimcoe was appointed Lieutenant-Governor on 12 September 1791, and left for Canada with his wife Elizabeth and daughter Sophia, leaving three daughters behind in England with their aunt. They left England in September and arrived in Canada on 11 November. Due to severe weather, the Simcoes spent the winter in Quebec City. Simcoe finally reached Kingston, Upper Canada on 24 June 1792.\n\nIn a proclamation on 16 July 1792, he renamed several islands at the mouth of the archipelago at the head of the St. Lawrence river for the victorious Generals at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (Amherst Island, Gage Island, Wolfe Island, and Howe Island).\n\nUnder the Constitutional Act, the provincial government consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor, an appointed Executive Council and Legislative Council, and an elected Legislative Assembly. The first meeting of the nine-member Legislative Council and sixteen-member Legislative Assembly took place at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) on 17 September 1792.\n\nFollowing Simcoe's work precipitated by the Chloe Cooley incident, the Assembly passed the first Act Against Slavery in the British Empire in 1793, and the English colonists of Upper Canada took pride in this distinction with respect to the French-Canadian populace of Lower Canada. The Upper Canadians valued their common law legal system, as opposed to the civil law of Quebec, which had chafed them ever since 1763. This was one of the primary reasons for the partition of 1791. Simcoe collaborated extensively with his Attorney-General John White on the file.\n\nSlavery was thus ended in Upper Canada long before it was abolished in the British Empire as a whole. By 1810, there were no slaves in Upper Canada, but the Crown did not abolish slavery throughout the Empire until 1834.\n\nSimcoe's first priority was the Northwest Indian War between the United States and the \"Western Confederacy\" of Native Americans west of the Appalachian Mountains and south of the Great Lakes (the Shawnee, Miami, Wyandot, and other tribes). This conflict had begun in 1785, and was still raging when Simcoe arrived in 1792. Simcoe had hoped to form an Indian buffer state between the two countries, even though he distrusted Joseph Brant, the main Indian leader. Simcoe rejected the section of the Treaty of Paris (1783) which awarded that area to the US, on the grounds that American actions had nullified the treaty. However, the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1793. The government in London decided to seek good terms with the United States. Simcoe was instructed to avoid giving the US reason to mistrust Britain but, at the same time, to keep the Natives on both sides of the border friendly to Britain. The Indians asked for British military support, which was initially refused, but in 1794 Britain supplied the Indians with rifles and ammunition.\n\nIn February 1794, the governor general, Lord Dorchester, expecting the US to ally with France, said that war was likely to break out between the US and Britain before the year was out. This encouraged the Indians in their war. Dorchester ordered Simcoe to rally the Indians and arm British vessels on the Great Lakes. He also built Fort Miami (present-day Maumee, Ohio) to supply the Indians. Simcoe expelled Americans from a settlement on the southern shore of Lake Erie which had threatened British control of the lake. US President Washington denounced the \"irregular and high-handed proceeding of Mr. Simcoe.\" While Dorchester planned for a defensive war, Simcoe urged London to declare war: \"Upper Canada is not to be defended by remaining within the boundary line.\" Dorchester was officially reprimanded by the Crown for his strong speech against the Americans in 1794.\n\nSimcoe realised that Newark made an unsuitable capital because it was on the Canada–US border and subject to attack. He proposed moving the capital to a more defensible position, in the middle of Upper Canada's southwestern peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. He named the new location London, and renamed the river there the Thames in anticipation of the change. Dorchester rejected this proposal, but accepted Simcoe's second choice, the present site of Toronto. Simcoe moved the capital there in 1793, and renamed the settlement York after Frederick, Duke of York, King George III's second son. The town was severely underdeveloped at the time of its founding so he brought with him politicians, builders, Nova Scotia timber men, and Englishmen skilled in whipsawing and cutting joists and rafters.\n\nSimcoe began construction of two roads through Upper Canada, for defence and to encourage settlement and trade. Yonge Street (named after British Minister of War Sir George Yonge) ran north-south from York to Lake Simcoe. Soldiers of the Queen's Rangers began cutting the road in August 1793, reaching Holland Landing in 1796. Dundas Street (named for Colonial Secretary Henry Dundas) ran east-west, between York and London.\n\nThe Northwest Indian War ended after the United States defeated the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. They made peace under the Treaty of Greenville. While still at war with France, Britain could not afford to antagonise the US in the Jay Treaty of 1794, and agreed to withdraw north of the Great Lakes, as agreed in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Simcoe evacuated the frontier forts.\n\nIn 1794 Simcoe had been appointed Major-General. In July 1796 poor health (gout and neuralgia) forced him to return to Britain. He was unable to return to Upper Canada and resigned his office in 1798.\n\nHe served briefly as the commander of British forces in Saint-Domingue (later Haiti). There, in the spring of 1797, he defended the coastal town of Saint-Marc but lost Mirebalais and the Central Plateau to the forces of Toussaint Louverture, leader of the slave revolt and by that point commander-in-chief of the French Republican forces on the island. This campaign signalled the end of the English attempt, in collaboration with planters, to restore slavery and other aspects of the \"ancien régime\" to take over the rich, sugar-producing island while France was involved in internal affairs of its Revolution.\n\nSimcoe was appointed colonel of the 81st Foot in 1798, but exchanged the position for the 22nd Foot less than six months later. He was also promoted to Lieutenant-General and was made commander of the Western District. In 1806, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, India (to succeed Cornwallis, who had died shortly after arriving in India.) Simcoe died in Exeter before assuming the post. Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake, was reappointed to replace Simcoe.\n\nSimcoe was buried in Wolford Chapel on the Simcoe family estate near Honiton, Devon. The Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired title to the chapel in 1982.\n\nBULLET::::- In the winter of 1779, the first known Valentine's Day letter in America was given by then Lieutenant Colonel John Simcoe to Sarah 'Sally' Townsend.\nBULLET::::- Simcoe Street in Oyster Bay, New York is named after him for his destruction of a vast apple orchard and reconstruction of a hill fort on the site.\nBULLET::::- Act Against Slavery passed in 1793, leading to the abolition of slavery in Upper Canada by 1810.

He is portrayed as an extraordinarily brutal and sadistic villain, but that characterization is only moderately supported by historical evidence, such as the 1778 massacre of sleeping Americans that he ordered. Further, the backstory given to the Simcoe character born and raised in British India, the son of a doctor who died in the Black Hole of Calcutta, is entirely fictional. The series also depicts Simcoe as starting his career in North America as a Captain in Setauket rather than as an Ensign (rank) in Boston and have him claim to have been defeated by the Spanish in Havana as a result of the outbreak of the Yellow Fever when the defeat really took place when he was a general in Haiti long after the Revolution was over.\n\nThe earliest episodes imply that his goal is to rape Anna Strong, but they later make it clear that despite his infatuation of her, an invention of the series, he would never dream of their relationship being other than consensual, as she is the one person to whom he does not intend any harm. Simcoe is also depicted as routinely forgetting that Major Andre's servant Abigail is no longer a slave, which is completely inconsistent with the historical Simcoe. The Simcoe also is not depicted as being above treason and having absolutely no qualms about conspiring to murder Major Hewlett and deliberately starting a civil war with the other Redcoats.\n\nHe even deliberately conceals the fact that Abraham Woodhull is secretly a spy for George Washington so that he can kill Woodhull himself. He also does not hesitate at all to tell Robert Rogers to slit the throat of one of his own Rangers. He even brags about being a \"Beast\" and is routinely described as evil, a madman, and a demon. The one redeeming quality the show gives him is that unlike Benedict Arnold, he would never deliberately endanger the lives of his men in an effort to make a profit. The series portrays a changed Simcoe towards the end as he became a government administrator, revealing a more compassionate individual who opposed slavery and racial discrimination just like his historical counterpart.\n\nBULLET::::- Craig, Gerald M. \"Upper Canada: the formative years, 1784–1841\" (McClelland & Stewart, 1963) ch 2\nBULLET::::- Fryer, Mary Beacock, and Christopher Dracott. \"John Graves Simcoe 1752–1806: A Biography\"(Dundurn, 1998) online\nBULLET::::- Mealing, S.

{"id": "15919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15919", "title": "John Wilkes Booth", "text": "John Wilkes Booth\n\nJohn Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. He was a member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and a well-known actor in his own right. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.\n\nBooth and a group of co-conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln but later planned to kill him, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered four days earlier, but Booth believed that the American Civil War was not yet over because Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's army was still fighting the Union Army.\n\nBooth was completely successful in carrying out his part of the plot. He shot Lincoln once in the back of the head, and the President died the next morning. Seward was severely wounded but recovered, and Vice President Johnson was never attacked.\n\nAfter the assassination, Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland and, 12 days later, arrived at a farm in rural northern Virginia where he was tracked down. Booth's companion gave himself up, but Booth refused and was shot by Union soldier Boston Corbett after the barn in which he was hiding was set ablaze. Eight other conspirators were tried and convicted, and four were hanged shortly after.\n\nBooth's parents were noted British Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth and his mistress Mary Ann Holmes, who moved to the United States from England in June 1821. They purchased a farm near Bel Air, Maryland, where John Wilkes Booth was born in a four-room log house on May 10, 1838, the ninth of ten children. He was named after English radical politician John Wilkes, a distant relative. Junius' wife Adelaide Delannoy Booth was granted a divorce in 1851 on grounds of adultery, and Holmes legally wed Junius on May 10, 1851, John Wilkes' 13th birthday. Nora Titone suggests in her book \"My Thoughts Be Bloody\" (2010) that the shame and ambition of Junius Brutus Booth's illegitimate actor sons Edwin and John Wilkes eventually spurred them to strive for achievement and acclaim as rivals—Edwin as a Unionist and John Wilkes as the assassin of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nBooth's father built Tudor Hall on the Harford County property as the family's summer home in 1851, while also maintaining a winter residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore. The Booth family was listed as living in Baltimore in the 1850 census.\nAs a boy, Booth was athletic and popular, and he became skilled at horsemanship and fencing. He attended the Bel Air Academy and was an indifferent student whom the headmaster described as \"not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time\". In 1850–1851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland. At the Milton school, students recited classical works by such authors as Cicero, Herodotus, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14 after his father's death.\n\nWhile attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Gypsy fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling him that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and \"meeting a bad end\". His sister recalled that he wrote down the palm-reader's prediction, showed it to his family and others, and often discussed its portents in moments of melancholy.\n\nBy age 16, Booth was interested in the theater and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to follow in the footsteps of his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus, Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.\n\nBooth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855 in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in \"Richard III\" at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore's Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently. In 1857, he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as \"J.B. Wilkes\", a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison with other members of his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth \"developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him.\" In February 1858, he played in \"Lucrezia Borgia\" at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over his line. Instead of introducing himself by saying, \"Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo\", he stammered, \"Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit! Who am I?\", causing the audience to roar with laughter.\n\nLater that year, Booth played the part of Mohegan Indian Chief Uncas in a play staged in Petersburg, Virginia, and then became a stock company actor at the Richmond Theatre in Virginia, where he became increasingly popular with audiences for his energetic performances. On October 5, 1858, he played the part of Horatio in \"Hamlet\", alongside his older brother Edwin in the title role. Afterward, Edwin led him to the theater's footlights and said to the audience, \"I think he's done well, don't you?\" In response, the audience applauded loudly and cried, \"Yes! Yes!\" In all, Booth performed in 83 plays in 1858. Booth said that, of all Shakespearean characters, his favorite role was Brutus, the slayer of a tyrant.\nSome critics called Booth \"the handsomest man in America\" and a \"natural genius\", and noted his having an \"astonishing memory\"; others were mixed in their estimation of his acting. He stood tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. Noted Civil War reporter George Alfred Townsend described him as a \"muscular, perfect man\" with \"curling hair, like a Corinthian capital\". Booth's stage performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical, with him leaping upon the stage and gesturing with passion. He was an excellent swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.\n\nHistorian Benjamin Platt Thomas wrote that Booth \"won celebrity with theater-goers by his romantic personal attraction\", but that he was \"too impatient for hard study\" and his \"brilliant talents had failed of full development.\" Author Gene Smith wrote that Booth's acting may not have been as precise as his brother Edwin's, but his strikingly handsome appearance enthralled women. As the 1850s drew to a close, Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor, earning $20,000 a year (equivalent to about $ more recently).\n\nBooth embarked on his first national tour as a leading actor after finishing the 1859–1860 theatre season in Richmond, Virginia. He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent. By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth's acting, \"He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius.\" The \"Philadelphia Press\" drama critic said, \"Without having [his brother] Edwin's culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are inclined to think, more natural genius.\" In October 1860, while performing in Columbus, Georgia, Booth was shot accidentally in his hotel, leaving a wound some thought would end his life.\nWhen the Civil War began on April 12, 1861, Booth was starring in Albany, New York. He was outspoken in his admiration for the South's secession, publicly calling it \"heroic.\" This so enraged local citizens that they demanded that he be banned from the stage for making \"treasonable statements\". Albany's drama critics were kinder, giving him rave reviews. One called him a genius, praising his acting for \"never fail[ing] to delight with his masterly impressions.\" As the Civil War raged across the divided land in 1862, Booth appeared mostly in Union and border states. In January, he played the title role in \"Richard III\" in St. Louis and then made his Chicago debut. In March, he made his first acting appearance in New York City. In May 1862, he made his Boston debut, playing nightly at the Boston Museum in \"Richard III\" (May 12, 15 and 23), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (May 13), \"The Robbers\" (May 14 and 21), \"Hamlet\" (May 16), \"The Apostate\" (May 19), \"The Stranger\" (May 20), and \"The Lady of Lyons\" (May 22). Following his performance of \"Richard III\" on May 12, the Boston \"Transcript\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> review the next day called Booth \"the most promising young actor on the American stage\".\n\nStarting in January 1863, he returned to the Boston Museum for a series of plays, including the role of villain Duke Pescara in \"The Apostate\", that won him acclaim from audiences and critics. Back in Washington in April, he played the title roles in \"Hamlet\" and \"Richard III,\" one of his favorites. He was billed as \"The Pride of the American People, A Star of the First Magnitude,\" and the critics were equally enthusiastic. The \"National Republican\" drama critic said that Booth \"took the hearts of the audience by storm\" and termed his performance \"a complete triumph\". At the beginning of July 1863, Booth finished the acting season at Cleveland's Academy of Music, as the Battle of Gettysburg raged in Pennsylvania. Between September and November, 1863, Booth played a hectic schedule in the northeast, appearing in Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut. Every day he received fan mail from infatuated women.\n\nFamily friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth was one of the first leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's \"The Marble Heart\". In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek sculptor in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, \"Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you.\" The President replied, \"He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn't he?\" On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.\nOn November 25, 1864, Booth performed for the only time with his brothers Edwin and Junius in a single engagement production of \"Julius Caesar\" at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. He played Mark Antony and his brother Edwin had the larger role of Brutus in a performance acclaimed as \"the greatest theatrical event in New York history.\" The proceeds went towards a statue of William Shakespeare for Central Park, which still stands today (2019). In January 1865, he acted in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" in Washington, again garnering rave reviews. The \"National Intelligencer\" called Booth's Romeo \"the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine character,\" especially praising the death scene. Booth made the final appearance of his acting career at Ford's on March 18, 1865, when he again played Duke Pescara in \"The Apostate.\"\n\nBooth invested some of his growing wealth in various enterprises during the early 1860s, including land speculation in Boston's Back Bay section. He also started a business partnership with John A. Ellsler, manager of the Cleveland Academy of Music, and with Thomas Mears to develop oil wells in northwestern Pennsylvania, where an oil boom had started in August 1859, following Edwin Drake's discovery of oil there, initially calling their venture Dramatic Oil but later renaming it Fuller Farm Oil. The partners invested in a site along the Allegheny River at Franklin, Pennsylvania in late 1863 for drilling. By early 1864, they had a producing deep oil well named Wilhelmina for Mears' wife, yielding 25 barrels (4 kL) of crude oil daily, then considered a good yield. The Fuller Farm Oil company was selling shares with a prospectus featuring the well-known actor's celebrity status as \"Mr. J. Wilkes Booth, a successful and intelligent operator in oil lands\". The partners were impatient to increase the well's output and attempted the use of explosives, which wrecked the well and ended production.\n\nBooth was already growing more obsessed with the South's worsening situation in the Civil War and angered at Lincoln's re-election. He withdrew from the oil business on November 27, 1864, with a substantial loss of his $6,000 investment ($81,400 in 2010 dollars).\n\nBooth was strongly opposed to the abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended the hanging of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500 men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's hanging, to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.\n\nLincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding portion of the population favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against Southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C., exposed, and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention. Lincoln suspended the writ of \"habeas corpus\" and imposed martial law in Baltimore and other portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in \"Ex parte Merryman\", that Lincoln's suspension of \"habeas corpus\" in Maryland was unconstitutional.\n\nAs a popular actor in the 1860s, Booth continued to travel extensively to perform in the North and South, and as far west as New Orleans. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle the anti-malarial drug quinine, which was crucial to the lives of residents of the Gulf coast, to the South during his travels there, since it was in short supply due to the Northern blockade.\nBooth was pro-Confederate, but his family was divided, like many Marylanders. He was outspoken in his love of the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred of Lincoln. As the Civil War went on, Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin, who declined to make stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to John Wilkes' fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and Lincoln. In early 1863, Booth was arrested in St. Louis while on a theatre tour, when he was heard saying that he \"wished the President and the whole damned government would go to hell.\" He was charged with making \"treasonous\" remarks against the government, but was released when he took an oath of allegiance to the Union and paid a substantial fine.\n\nIn February 1865, Booth became infatuated with Lucy Lambert Hale, the daughter of U.S. Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire, and they became secretly engaged when Booth received his mother's blessing for their marriage plans. \"You have so often been dead in love,\" his mother counseled Booth in a letter, \"be well assured she is really and truly devoted to you.\" Booth composed a handwritten Valentine card for his fiancée on February 13, expressing his \"adoration\". She was unaware of Booth's deep antipathy towards Lincoln.\n\nAs the 1864 presidential election drew near, the Confederacy's prospects for victory were ebbing, and the tide of war increasingly favored the North. The likelihood of Lincoln's re-election filled Booth with rage towards the President, whom Booth blamed for the war and all of the South's troubles. Booth had promised his mother at the outbreak of war that he would not enlist as a soldier, but he increasingly chafed at not fighting for the South, writing in a letter to her, \"I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence.\" He began to formulate plans to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the Old Soldiers Home, from the White House, and to smuggle him across the Potomac River and into Richmond, Virginia. Once in Confederate hands, Lincoln would be exchanged for Confederate Army prisoners of war held in Northern prisons and, Booth reasoned, bring the war to an end by emboldening opposition to the war in the North or forcing Union recognition of the Confederate government.\n\nThroughout the Civil War, the Confederacy maintained a network of underground operators in southern Maryland, particularly Charles and St. Mary's Counties, smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents as far north as Canada. Booth recruited his friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O'Laughlen as accomplices. They met often at the house of Confederate sympathizer Maggie Branson at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore. He also met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at The Parker House in Boston.\nIn October, Booth made an unexplained trip to Montreal, which was a center of clandestine Confederate activity. He spent ten days in the city, staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a rendezvous for the Confederate Secret Service, and meeting several Confederate agents there. No conclusive proof has linked Booth's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving the leadership of the Confederate government, but historian David Herbert Donald states that \"at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service, the abduction of the Union President was under consideration.\" Historian Thomas Goodrich concludes that Booth entered the Confederate Secret Service as a spy and courier.\n\nLincoln won a landslide re-election in early November, 1864, on a platform that advocated abolishing slavery altogether, by Constitutional Amendment. Booth, meanwhile, devoted increased energy and money to his kidnapping plot. He assembled a loose-knit band of Southern sympathizers, including David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and rebel agent John Surratt. They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt's mother Mary Surratt.\n\nBy this time, Booth was arguing vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln and the war, and Edwin finally told him that he was no longer welcome at his New York home. Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia. \"That man's appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery.\" Asia recalled that he decried Lincoln's re-election, \"making himself a king\", and that he went on \"wild tirades\" in 1865, as the Confederacy's defeat became more certain.\n\nBooth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4 as the guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale. In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There was no attempt to assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, Booth remarked about his \"excellent chance...to kill the President, if I had wished.\" On March 17, he learned that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play \"Still Waters Run Deep\" at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. He assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home in hope of kidnapping Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the President did not appear. Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington — where Booth was staying.\n\nOn April 12, 1865, Booth heard the news that Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was \"Venice Preserv'd\". Weichmann did not understand the reference; \"Venice Preserv'd\" is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.\n\nThe previous day, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves, and Booth declared that it would be the last speech that Lincoln would ever make.\n\nOn the morning of Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Booth went to Ford's Theatre to get his mail. While there, he was told by John Ford's brother that President and Mrs. Lincoln would be attending the play \"Our American Cousin\" at Ford's Theatre that evening, accompanied by Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included making arrangements with livery stable owner James W. Pumphrey for a getaway horse and an escape route. Booth informed Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State William H. Seward and Atzerodt to do so to Vice President Andrew Johnson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.\n\nBy targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the presidency, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. The possibility of assassinating the Union Army's commanding general as well was foiled when Grant declined the theatre invitation at his wife's insistence. Instead, the Grants departed Washington by train that evening for a visit to relatives in New Jersey. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war if one Confederate army remained in the field or, that failing, to avenge the South's defeat.\n\nBooth had free access to all parts of the theater as a famous and popular actor who had frequently performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day, so that he could observe the box's occupants and verify that the President had made it to the play.\n\nBooth slipped into Lincoln's box that evening at around 10p.m. as the play progressed and shot the President in the back of the head with a .41 caliber Deringer pistol. Booth's escape was almost thwarted by Major Henry Rathbone, who was in the presidential box with Mary Todd Lincoln. Booth stabbed Rathbone when the startled officer lunged at him. Rathbone's fiancée Clara Harris was also in the box but was not harmed.\n\nBooth then jumped from the President's box to the stage, where he raised his knife and shouted \"\"Sic semper tyrannis\"\". (Latin for \"Thus always to tyrants,\" attributed to Brutus at Caesar's assassination; state motto of Virginia and mentioned in the new \"Maryland, My Maryland\", future anthem of Booth's Maryland.) According to some accounts, Booth added, \"I have done it, the South is avenged!\" Some witnesses reported that Booth fractured or otherwise injured his leg when his spur snagged a decorative U.S. Treasury Guard flag while leaping to the stage. Historian Michael W. Kauffman questioned this legend in his book \"American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies\", writing that eyewitness accounts of Booth's hurried stage exit made it unlikely that his leg was broken then. Kauffman contends that Booth was injured later that night during his flight to escape when his horse tripped and fell on him, calling Booth's claim to the contrary an exaggeration to portray his own actions as heroic.\n\nBooth was the only one of the assassins to succeed. Powell was able to stab Seward, who was bedridden as a result of an earlier carriage accident. Seward was badly wounded but he survived. Atzerodt lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking alcohol; he never made an attempt to kill Johnson.\n\nIn the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford's Theatre, Booth fled by a stage door to the alley, where his getaway horse was held for him by Joseph \"Peanuts\" Burroughs. The owner of the horse had warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and would break halter if left unattended. Booth left the horse with Edmund Spangler and Spangler arranged for Burroughs to hold it.\n\nThe fleeing assassin galloped into southern Maryland, accompanied by David Herold, having planned his escape route to take advantage of the sparsely settled area's lack of telegraphs and railroads, along with its predominantly Confederate sympathies. He thought that the area's dense forests and the swampy terrain of Zekiah Swamp made it ideal for an escape route into rural Virginia. At midnight, Booth and Herold arrived at Surratt's Tavern on the Brandywine Pike, from Washington, where they had stored guns and equipment earlier in the year as part of the kidnap plot.\n\nThe fugitives then continued southward, stopping before dawn on April 15 for treatment of Booth's injured leg at the home of Dr. Samuel Mudd in St. Catharine, from Washington. Mudd later said that Booth told him the injury occurred when his horse fell. The next day, Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox around 4 am. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby, Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones, his foster brother and a Confederate agent in charge of spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862. The War Department advertised a $100,000 reward ($ in 2019 USD) by order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices, and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively, following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to Col. Lafayette Baker.\nFederal troops combed the rural area's woods and swamps for Booth in the days following the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent African-American abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an \"unspeakable calamity\". Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an \"accursed devil,\" \"monster,\" \"madman,\" and a \"wretched fiend.\" Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: \"Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily.\" Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act \"a disgrace to the age\". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.\n\nNot all were grief-stricken. In New York City, a man was attacked by an enraged crowd when he shouted, \"It served Old Abe right!\" after hearing the news of Lincoln's death. Elsewhere in the South, Lincoln was hated in death as in life, and Booth was viewed as a hero as many rejoiced at news of his deed. Other Southerners feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states. \"Instead of being a great Southern hero, his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North,\" writes Kunhardt.\n\nBooth lay in hiding in the Maryland woods, waiting for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia. He read the accounts of national mourning reported in the newspapers brought to him by Jones each day. By April 20, he was aware that some of his co-conspirators had already been arrested: Mary Surratt, Powell (or Paine), Arnold, and O'Laughlen. Booth was surprised to find little public sympathy for his action, especially from those anti-Lincoln newspapers that had previously excoriated the President in life. News of the assassination reached the far corners of the nation, and indignation was aroused against Lincoln's critics, whom many blamed for encouraging Booth to act. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" editorialized:\n\nBooth wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, as he awaited nightfall before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia (\"see map\"):\n\nThat same day, the nine-car funeral train bearing Lincoln's body departed Washington on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, arriving at Baltimore's Camden Station at 10 am, the first stop on a 13-day journey to Springfield, Illinois, its final destination. The funeral train slowly made its way westward through seven states, stopping en route at Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Trenton, New York, Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis during the following days. About 7 million people lined the railroad tracks along the route, holding aloft signs with legends such as \"We mourn our loss,\" \"He lives in the hearts of his people,\" and \"The darkest hour in history.\"\nIn the cities where the train stopped, 1.5 million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin. Aboard the train was Clarence Depew, president of the New York Central Railroad, who said, \"As we sped over the rails at night, the scene was the most pathetic ever witnessed. At every crossroads the glare of innumerable torches illuminated the whole population, kneeling on the ground.\" Dorothy Kunhardt called the funeral train's journey \"the mightiest outpouring of national grief the world had yet seen.\"\n\nMourners were viewing Lincoln's remains when the funeral train steamed into Harrisburg at 8:20 pm, while Booth and Herold were provided with a boat and compass by Jones to cross the Potomac at night on April 21. Instead of reaching Virginia, they mistakenly navigated upriver to a bend in the broad Potomac River, coming ashore again in Maryland on April 22. The 23-year-old Herold knew the area well, having frequently hunted there, and recognized a nearby farm as belonging to a Confederate sympathizer. The farmer led them to his son-in-law, Col. John J. Hughes, who provided the fugitives with food and a hideout until nightfall, for a second attempt to row across the river to Virginia. Booth wrote in his diary:\n\nThe pair finally reached the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before dawn on April 23. There, they made contact with Thomas Harbin, whom Booth had previously brought into his erstwhile kidnapping plot. Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area named William Bryant who supplied them with horses.\n\nWhile Lincoln's funeral train was in New York City on April 24, Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty was dispatched from Washington at 2 p.m. with a detachment of 26 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment to capture Booth in Virginia, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Everton Conger, an intelligence officer assigned by Lafayette Baker. The detachment steamed down the Potomac River on the boat \"John S. Ide\", landing at Belle Plain, Virginia, at 10 pm. The pursuers crossed the Rappahannock River and tracked Booth and Herold to Richard H. Garrett's farm, about south of Port Royal, Virginia. Booth and Herold had been led to the farm on April 24 by William S. Jett, a former private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock. The Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination; Booth was introduced to them as \"James W. Boyd\", a Confederate soldier, they were told, who had been wounded in the battle of Petersburg and was returning home.\n\nGarrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, he became a Baptist minister and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture was published in the \"Confederate Veteran\" as the \"True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth.\" According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased with the collapse of the Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination had failed. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, \"Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him.\"\n\nConger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers caught up with the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett's tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger's demand to surrender, saying, \"I prefer to come out and fight.\" The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett's later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive \"raised his pistol to shoot\" at them. Conger's report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth \"without order, pretext or excuse,\" and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett's farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, \"Tell my mother I died for my country.\" Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, \"Useless, useless,\" and died as dawn was breaking. In Booth's pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth's fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln's death, \"Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.\"\n\nShortly after Booth's death, his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia, \"Think no more of him as your brother; he is dead to us now, as he soon must be to all the world, but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit, in another world.\" Asia also had in her possession a sealed letter that Booth had given her in January 1865 for safekeeping, only to be opened upon his death. In the letter, Booth had written:\n\nBooth's letter was seized by Federal troops, along with other family papers at Asia's house, and published by \"The New York Times\" while the manhunt was still underway. It explained his reasons for plotting against Lincoln. In it he decried Lincoln's war policy as one of \"total annihilation\", and said:\n\nBooth's body was shrouded in a blanket and tied to the side of an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS \"Montauk\" and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used to make sure that the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae were removed during the autopsy to allow access to the bullet. These bones are still on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary, later moved to a warehouse at the Washington Arsenal on October 1, 1867. In 1869, the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, after a burial ceremony conducted by Fleming James, minister of Christ Episcopal Church, in the presence of more than 40 people. Russell Conwell visited homes in the vanquished former Confederate states during this time, and he found that hatred of Lincoln still smoldered. \"Photographs of Wilkes Booth, with the last words of great martyrs printed upon its borders...adorn their drawing rooms\".\n\nEight others implicated in Lincoln's assassination were tried by a military tribunal in Washington, D.C., and found guilty on June 30, 1865. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7, 1865. Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida's isolated Dry Tortugas. Edmund Spangler was given a six-year term in prison. O'Laughlen died in a yellow fever epidemic there in 1867. The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew Johnson.\n\nForty years later, when the centenary of Lincoln's birth was celebrated in 1909, a border state official reflected on Booth's assassination of Lincoln: \"Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment, that 'had Lincoln lived' the days of Reconstruction might have been softened and the era of good feeling ushered in earlier.\" The majority of Northerners viewed Booth as a madman or monster who murdered the savior of the Union, while in the South, many cursed Booth for bringing upon them the harsh revenge of an incensed North instead of the reconciliation promised by Lincoln. A century later, Goodrich concluded in 2005, \"For millions of people, particularly in the South, it would be decades before the impact of the Lincoln assassination began to release its terrible hold on their lives\".\n\nAuthor Francis Wilson was 11 years old at the time of Lincoln's assassination. He wrote an epitaph of Booth in his 1929 book \"John Wilkes Booth\": \"In the terrible deed he committed, he was actuated by no thought of monetary gain, but by a self-sacrificing, albeit wholly fanatical devotion to a cause he thought supreme.\" Others have seen less unselfish motives, such as shame, ambition, and sibling rivalry for achievement and fame.\n\nIn 1907, Finis L. Bates wrote \"Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth\", contending that a Booth look-alike was mistakenly killed at the Garrett farm while Booth eluded his pursuers. Booth, said Bates, assumed the pseudonym \"John St. Helen\" and settled on the Paluxy River near Glen Rose, Texas, and later moved to Granbury, Texas. He fell gravely ill and made a deathbed confession that he was the fugitive assassin, but he then recovered and fled, eventually committing suicide in 1903 in Enid, Oklahoma, under the alias \"David E. George\". By 1913, more than 70,000 copies of the book had been sold, and Bates exhibited St. Helen's mummified body in carnival sideshows.\nIn response, the Maryland Historical Society published an account in 1913 by Baltimore mayor William M. Pegram, who had viewed Booth's remains upon the casket's arrival at the Weaver funeral home in Baltimore on February 18, 1869, for burial at Green Mount Cemetery. Pegram had known Booth well as a young man; he submitted a sworn statement that the body which he had seen in 1869 was Booth's. Others positively identified this body as Booth at the funeral home, including Booth's mother, brother, and sister, along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances. In 1911, the \"The New York Times\" had published an account by their reporter detailing the burial of Booth's body at the cemetery and those who were witnesses. The rumor periodically revived, as in the 1920s when a corpse was exhibited on a national tour by a carnival promoter and advertised as the \"Man Who Shot Lincoln\". According to a 1938 article in the \"Saturday Evening Post\", the exhibitor said that he obtained St. Helen's corpse from Bates' widow.\n\n\"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" (1977) contended that there was a government plot to conceal Booth's escape, reviving interest in the story and prompting the display of St. Helen's mummified body in Chicago that year. The book sold more than one million copies and was made into a feature film called \"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" which was theatrically released later that year. The 1998 book \"The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth\" contended that Booth had escaped, sought refuge in Japan, and eventually returned to the United States. In 1994 two historians together with several descendants sought a court order for the exhumation of Booth's body at Green Mount Cemetery which was, according to their lawyer, \"intended to prove or disprove longstanding theories on Booth's escape\" by conducting a photo-superimposition analysis. The application was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, \"the unreliability of petitioners' less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory\" as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling.\n\nIn December 2010, descendants of Edwin Booth reported that they obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain DNA samples to compare with a sample of his brother John's DNA to refute the rumor that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol Johnson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.\n\nBULLET::::- Booth was portrayed by Raoul Walsh in the 1915 film \"Birth of a Nation\".\nBULLET::::- John Wilkes Booth is played by John Derek in the film \"Prince of Players\" (1955), a biography of Edwin Booth (played by Richard Burton).\nBULLET::::- Booth is played by Rob Morrow in the television film \"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\" (1998).\nBULLET::::- James Marsden plays Booth in a flashback cameo in the comedy \"Zoolander\" (2001)\nBULLET::::- Chris Conner portrayed John Wilkes Booth in the director's cut of the 2003 film \"Gods and Generals\".\nBULLET::::- Booth is portrayed by Toby Kebbell in the Robert Redford film \"The Conspirator\" (2010).\nBULLET::::- Jesse Johnson plays Booth in the telefim \"Killing Lincoln\" (2013), where he is the main character.\n\nBULLET::::- In David O.

{"id": "15923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15923", "title": "Dan Quayle", "text": "Dan Quayle\n\nJames Danforth Quayle (born February 4, 1947) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 44th vice president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. Quayle was also a U.S. representative from 1977 to 1981 and a U.S. senator from 1981 to 1989 from the state of Indiana.\n\nA native of Indianapolis, Indiana, Quayle spent most of his childhood in Paradise Valley, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. He married Marilyn Tucker in 1972 and obtained his J.D. degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law in 1974. Quayle practiced law in Huntington, Indiana with his wife before his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1976. In 1980 Quayle was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn 1988, Vice President and Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush chose Quayle as his running mate. Quayle's vice presidential debate against Democratic candidate Lloyd Bentsen was notable for the \"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\" incident. The Bush/Quayle ticket won the 1988 election over the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Bentsen, and Quayle became Vice President in January 1989. As Vice President, he made official visits to 47 countries and was appointed chairman of the National Space Council. He secured re-nomination for Vice President in 1992, but Democrat Bill Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, defeated the Bush/Quayle ticket. \n\nIn 1994 Quayle published his memoir, \"Standing Firm\". He declined to run for President in 1996 because he was suffering from phlebitis. Quayle sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but later withdrew from the campaign and supported the eventual winner, George W. Bush. He joined Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm, in 1999. \n\nQuayle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Martha Corinne (née Pulliam) and James Cline Quayle. He has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as \"James Danforth Quayle III\". In his memoir he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the Isle of Man, where his great-grandfather was born.\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, was a wealthy and influential publishing magnate who founded Central Newspapers, Inc., and owned over a dozen major newspapers, such as \"The Arizona Republic\" and \"The Indianapolis Star\". James C. Quayle moved his family to Arizona in 1955 to run a branch of the family's publishing empire.\n\nAfter spending much of his youth in Arizona, Quayle returned to his native Indiana and graduated from Huntington North High School in Huntington in 1965. He then matriculated at DePauw University, where he received his B.A. degree in political science in 1969, was a 3-year letterman for the University Golf Team (1967–69) and a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon (Psi Phi chapter). After graduating, Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard and served from 1969 to 1975, reaching the rank of sergeant. While serving in the Guard, he earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1974 at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He met his future wife, Marilyn, who was taking night classes at the same law school at the time.\nQuayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Indiana Attorney General in July 1971. Later that year he became an administrative assistant to Governor Edgar Whitcomb. From 1973 to 1974 he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. Upon graduating from law school, Quayle worked as associate publisher of his family's newspaper, the \"Huntington Herald-Press\".\nIn 1976 Quayle was elected to the House of Representatives from Indiana's 4th congressional district, defeating eight-term incumbent Democrat J. Edward Roush by a 55%-to-45% margin. He was reelected in 1978 by the biggest margin achieved to date in that district.\n\nIn 1980, at age 33, Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the Senate from the state of Indiana, defeating three-term incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh with 54% of the vote. Making Indiana political history again, Quayle was reelected to the Senate in 1986 with the largest margin ever achieved to that date by a candidate in a statewide Indiana race, taking 61% of the vote against his Democratic opponent, Jill Long.\n\nIn November 1978 Congressman Leo Ryan of California invited Quayle to accompany him on a delegation to investigate unsafe conditions at the Jonestown settlement in Guyana, but Quayle was unable to participate. The decision likely saved Quayle's life, because Ryan and his entourage were subsequently murdered at the airstrip in Jonestown as the party tried to escape the massacre.\n\nIn 1986 Quayle was criticized for championing the cause of Daniel Anthony Manion, a candidate for a federal appellate judgeship, who was in law school one year above Quayle. The American Bar Association had evaluated Manion as \"qualified/unqualified\", its lower passing grade. Manion was nominated for the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan on February 21, 1986, and confirmed by the Senate on June 26, 1986.\n\nOn August 16, 1988, at the Republican convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle to be his running mate in the 1988 United States presidential election. The choice immediately became controversial. Outgoing President Ronald Reagan praised Quayle for his \"energy and enthusiasm\". Press coverage of the convention was dominated by questions about \"the three Quayle problems\". The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be vice president. Quayle seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead, which it did not relinquish for the rest of the campaign.\n\nIn the October 1988 vice-presidential debate, Quayle debated Democratic candidate Lloyd Bentsen. When the subject of the debate turned to Quayle's relatively limited experience in public life, he compared the length of his congressional service (12 years) with that of late President John F. Kennedy (14 years), as Kennedy had less experience than his rivals during the 1960 presidential nomination. It was a factual comparison, although Quayle's advisers cautioned beforehand that it could be used against him. Bentsen's response—\"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\"—subsequently became a part of the political lexicon. During the debate, Quayle's strategy was to criticize Dukakis as too liberal.\n\nThe Bush/Quayle ticket won the November election by a 53–46 percent margin, sweeping 40 states and capturing 426 electoral votes. Quayle did not cast any tie-breaking votes in his role as President of the Senate, becoming only the second vice-president (after Charles W. Fairbanks) not to do so while serving a complete term.\n\nDuring his vice presidency, Quayle made official trips to 47 countries. Bush named Quayle head of the Council on Competitiveness and the first chairman of the National Space Council. As head of the NSC he called for greater efforts to protect Earth against the danger of potential asteroid impacts.\nAfter a briefing by Lt. General Daniel O. Graham, (USA Ret.), Max Hunter, and Jerry Pournelle, Quayle sponsored the development of an experimental Single Stage to Orbit X-Program, which resulted in the building of the DC/X which was flown and tested at White Sands.\n\nQuayle has since described the vice presidency as \"an awkward office. You're president of the Senate. You're not even officially part of the executive branch—you're part of the legislative branch. You're paid by the Senate, not by the executive branch. And it's the president's agenda. It's not your agenda. You're going to disagree from time to time, but you salute and carry out the orders the best you can\".\n\nOn May 19, 1992, Quayle gave a speech titled \"\" to the Commonwealth Club of California on the subject of the Los Angeles riots. In the speech he blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the single mother title character in the television program \"Murphy Brown\" as an example of how popular culture contributes to this \"poverty of values\", saying, \"It doesn't help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown—a character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid, professional woman—mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another 'lifestyle choice'.\"\n\nThe \"Murphy Brown speech\" became one of the most memorable incidents of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of marriage, says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown \"kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the 'collapse of the family. In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said \"I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.\" Others interpreted it differently; singer Tanya Tucker was widely quoted as saying \"Who the hell is Dan Quayle to come after single mothers?\"\n\nThroughout his time as vice president, Quayle was widely ridiculed in the media and many in the general public, both in the U.S. and overseas, as an intellectual lightweight and an incompetent individual. Contributing greatly to the perception of Quayle's incompetence was his tendency to make public statements that were either impossible (\"I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future\"), self-contradictory (\"'I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy, but that could change'\"), self-contradictory and confused (\"The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. ... No, not our nation's, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century, but in this century's history\"), or just confused (such as the comments he made in a May 1989 address to the United Negro College Fund. Commenting on the United Negro College Fund's slogan—which is \"a mind is a terrible thing to waste\"—Quayle said, \"You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one's mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is\").\n\nShortly after Bush announced the Space Exploration Initiative, which included a manned landing on Mars, Quayle was asked his thoughts on sending humans to Mars. In his response, he made a series of scientifically incorrect statements: \"Mars is essentially in the same orbit [as Earth]...Mars is somewhat the same distance from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can breathe.\"\n\nOn June 15, 1992, Quayle altered 12-year-old student William Figueroa's correct spelling of \"potato\" to \"potatoe\" at the Muñoz Rivera Elementary School spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the subject of widespread ridicule for his error. According to \"The New York Times\" and Quayle's memoirs, he was relying on cards provided by the school, which Quayle says included the misspelling. Quayle said he was uncomfortable with the version he gave, but did so because he decided to trust the school's incorrect written materials instead of his own judgment.\n\nIn the 1992 election, Bush and Quayle were challenged in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore and the independent ticket of Texas businessman Ross Perot and retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale.\n\nAs Bush lagged in the polls in the weeks preceding the August 1992 Republican National Convention, some Republican strategists (led by Secretary of State James Baker) viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement. Quayle ultimately survived the challenge and secured renomination.\n\nDuring the 1992 presidential campaign, Quayle told the news media that he believed homosexuality was a choice, and \"the wrong choice.\"\n\nQuayle faced off against Gore and Stockdale in the vice presidential debate on October 13, 1992. He attempted to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive. Quayle criticized Gore's book \"Earth in the Balance\" with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group FAIR for inaccuracy. In Quayle's closing argument, he sharply asked voters, \"Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?\" and \"Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?\" Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused. Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle's performance, and his camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater, but post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore or Quayle had won. It ultimately proved to be a minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle subsequently lost.\n\n \nQuayle authored a 1994 memoir, \"Standing Firm\", which became a bestseller. His second book, \"The American Family: Discovering the Values That Make Us Strong\", was published in 1996 and a third book, \"Worth Fighting For\", was published in 1999. \n\nQuayle considered but decided against running for Governor of Indiana in 1996. He decided against running for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, citing health problems related to phlebitis. Quayle moved to Arizona in 1996.\n\nQuayle announced, during an appearance on \"Larry King Live\", his intention to run for president in 2000. In April 1999, Quayle officially announced his candidacy for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, attacking front-runner George W. Bush by saying \"we do not want another candidate who needs on-the-job training\". In the first contest among the Republican candidates, the Ames Straw Poll of August 1999, he finished eighth. He withdrew from the race the following month and supported Bush.\nQuayle, then working as an investment banker in Phoenix, was mentioned as a candidate for Governor of Arizona prior to the 2002 election, but eventually declined to run.\n\nIn a February 2010 interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Quayle announced that his son Ben would be a candidate for the U.S. Congress, running for a seat representing Arizona's 3rd congressional district. Ben won the election. In his first bid for reelection, due to redistricting, he faced off against fellow Republican Congressman David Schweikert in a primary and narrowly lost.\n\nOn January 31, 2011, Quayle wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to commute Jonathan Pollard's sentence.\n\nIn December 2011 Quayle endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nFor the United States presidential election in 2016 Quayle endorsed Jeb Bush. After Bush failed to win the nomination, Quayle ultimately endorsed Donald Trump; he was later seen visiting with Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan prior to Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe Dan Quayle Center and Museum, in Huntington, Indiana, features information on Quayle and on all U.S. Vice Presidents.\n\nQuayle is an Honorary Trustee Emeritus of the Hudson Institute and is president of Quayle and Associates. He has also been a member of the Board of Directors of Heckmann Corporation, a water-sector company, since the company's inception and serves as Chairman of the company's Compensation and Nominating & Governance Committees. Quayle is a director of Aozora Bank, based in Tokyo, Japan. He has also been on the board of directors of other companies, including K2 Sports, AmTran Inc., Central Newspapers Inc., BTC Inc. and Carvana Co.\n\nIn 1999 Quayle joined Cerberus Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar private-equity firm, where he serves as chairman of the company's Global Investments division. As chairman of the international advisory board of Cerberus Capital Management, he recruited former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who would have been installed as chairman if Cerberus had successfully acquired Air Canada. \n\nIn early 2014, Quayle traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in an attempt to speed approval for a deal in which Cerberus acquired nearly £1.3 billion in Northern Ireland loans from the Republic of Ireland's National Asset Management Agency. The Irish government is investigating the deal, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York are investigating Quayle's involvement as a potentially \"very serious\" misuse of the vice president's office. As of December 2018, Quayle serves as Chairman of Global Investments at Cerberus.\n\nQuayle lives with his wife, Marilyn Quayle, in Paradise Valley, Arizona. They married in November 1972 and have three children: Tucker, Benjamin, and Corinne. Benjamin Quayle served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013, representing Arizona's 3rd congressional district.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Standing Firm: A Vice-Presidential Memoir\", HarperCollins, May 1994. hardcover, ; mass market paperback, May 1995; ; Limited edition, 1994,\nBULLET::::- \"The American Family: Discovering the Values That Make Us Strong\" (with Diane Medved), Harpercollins, April 1996, (hardcover), (paperback)\nBULLET::::- \"Worth Fighting For\", W Publishing Group, July 1999,\n\nBULLET::::- \"What a Waste It Is to Lose One's Mind: The Unauthorized Autobiography of Dan Quayle\", Quayle Quarterly (published by Rose Communications), April 1992, .\nBULLET::::- Joe Queenan, \"Imperial Caddy: The Rise of Dan Quayle in America and the Decline and Fall of Practically Everything Else\", Hyperion Books; October 1992 (1st edition). .\nBULLET::::- Richard F.

{"id": "15924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15924", "title": "Julius Caesar", "text": "Julius Caesar\n\nGaius Julius Caesar ( , ; 12 or 13 July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC), known by his nomen and cognomen Julius Caesar, was a populist Roman dictator, politician, and military general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He was also a historian and wrote Latin prose.\n\nIn 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as \"Populares\" were opposed by the \"Optimates\" within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a number of his accomplishments, notably his victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC. During this time, Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the English Channel and the Rhine River, when he built a bridge across the Rhine and crossed the Channel to invade Britain. Caesar's wars extended Rome's territory to Britain and past Gaul. These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Leaving his command in Gaul meant losing his immunity from being charged as a criminal for waging unsanctioned wars. As a result, Caesar found himself with no other options but to cross the Rubicon with the 13th Legion in 49 BC, leaving his province and illegally entering Roman Italy under arms. This began Caesar's civil war, and his victory in the war by 45 BC put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.\n\nAfter assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Republic. He initiated land reform and support for veterans. He centralized the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator for life\" (Latin: \"\"dictator perpetuo\"\"), giving him additional authority. His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the Ides of March (15 March), 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Gaius Cassius Longinus, Marcus Junius Brutus and Decimus Junius Brutus, who stabbed him to death. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began.\n\nMuch of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history. His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for \"Emperor\"; the title \"Caesar\" was used throughout the Roman Empire, giving rise to modern cognates such as Kaiser and Tsar. He has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works, and his political philosophy, known as Caesarism\",\" inspired politicians into the modern era.\n\nGaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, the \"gens Julia\", which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, supposedly the son of the goddess Venus. The Julii were of Alban origin, mentioned as one of the leading Alban houses, which settled in Rome around the mid-7th century BC, after the destruction of Alba Longa. They were granted patrician status, along with other noble Alban families. The Julii also existed at an early period at Bovillae, evidenced by a very ancient inscription on an altar in the theatre of that town, which speaks of their offering sacrifices according to the \"lege Albana\", or Alban rites. The \"cognomen\" \"Caesar\" originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, \"caedere\", \"caes-\"). The \"Historia Augusta\" suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin \"caesaries\"); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin \"oculis caesiis\"); or that he killed an elephant (\"caesai\" in Moorish) in battle. Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name.\n\nDespite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC. Caesar's father, also called Gaius Julius Caesar, governed the province of Asia, and his sister Julia, Caesar's aunt, married Gaius Marius, one of the most prominent figures in the Republic. His mother, Aurelia Cotta, came from an influential family. Little is recorded of Caesar's childhood.\n\nIn 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly, so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided with a civil war between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Both sides carried out bloody purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally Lucius Cornelius Cinna were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated as the new Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter), and he was married to Cinna's daughter Cornelia.\n\nFollowing Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding. The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the Vestal Virgins. Sulla gave in reluctantly and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar. The loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.\n\nCaesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the assistance of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied for the rest of his life.\n\nHearing of Sulla's death in 78 BC, Caesar felt safe enough to return to Rome. He lacked means since his inheritance was confiscated, but he acquired a modest house in Subura, a lower-class neighbourhood of Rome. He turned to legal advocacy and became known for his exceptional oratory accompanied by impassioned gestures and a high-pitched voice, and ruthless prosecution of former governors notorious for extortion and corruption.\nOn the way across the Aegean Sea, Caesar was kidnapped by pirates and held prisoner. He maintained an attitude of superiority throughout his captivity. The pirates demanded a ransom of 20 talents of silver, but he insisted that they ask for 50. After the ransom was paid, Caesar raised a fleet, pursued and captured the pirates, and imprisoned them. He had them crucified on his own authority, as he had promised while in captivity—a promise that the pirates had taken as a joke. As a sign of leniency, he first had their throats cut. He was soon called back into military action in Asia, raising a band of auxiliaries to repel an incursion from the east.\n\nOn his return to Rome, he was elected military tribune, a first step in a political career. He was elected \"quaestor\" for 69 BC, and during that year he delivered the funeral oration for his aunt Julia, and included images of her husband Marius in the funeral procession, unseen since the days of Sulla. His wife Cornelia also died that year. Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Hispania after her funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he is said to have encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little. On his return in 67 BC, he married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla, whom he later divorced in 61 BC after her embroilment in the Bona Dea scandal. In 65 BC, he was elected curule aedile, and staged lavish games that won him further attention and popular support.\n\nIn 63 BC, he ran for election to the post of \"Pontifex Maximus\", chief priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two powerful senators. Accusations of bribery were made by all sides. Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience and standing. Cicero was consul that year, and he exposed Catiline's conspiracy to seize control of the republic; several senators accused Caesar of involvement in the plot.\n\nAfter serving as \"praetor\" in 62 BC, Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior (the western part of the Iberian Peninsula) as \"propraetor\", though some sources suggest that he held proconsular powers. He was still in considerable debt and needed to satisfy his creditors before he could leave. He turned to Marcus Licinius Crassus, the richest man in Rome. Crassus paid some of Caesar's debts and acted as guarantor for others, in return for political support in his opposition to the interests of Pompey. Even so, to avoid becoming a private citizen and thus open to prosecution for his debts, Caesar left for his province before his praetorship had ended. In Spain, he conquered two local tribes and was hailed as \"imperator\" by his troops; he reformed the law regarding debts, and completed his governorship in high esteem.\n\nCaesar was acclaimed \"Imperator\" in 60 BC (and again later in 45 BC). In the Roman Republic, this was an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army troops in the field would proclaim their commander \"imperator\", an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would have to remain a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand \"in absentia\", but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.\n\nIn 60 BC, Caesar sought election as consul for 59 BC, along with two other candidates. The election was sordid – even Cato, with his reputation for incorruptibility, is said to have resorted to bribery in favour of one of Caesar's opponents. Caesar won, along with conservative Marcus Bibulus.\n\nCaesar was already in Marcus Licinius Crassus' political debt, but he also made overtures to Pompey. Pompey and Crassus had been at odds for a decade, so Caesar tried to reconcile them. The three of them had enough money and political influence to control public business. This informal alliance, known as the First Triumvirate (\"rule of three men\"), was cemented by the marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia. Caesar also married again, this time Calpurnia, who was the daughter of another powerful senator.\n\nCaesar proposed a law for redistributing public lands to the poor—by force of arms, if need be—a proposal supported by Pompey and by Crassus, making the triumvirate public. Pompey filled the city with soldiers, a move which intimidated the triumvirate's opponents. Bibulus attempted to declare the omens unfavourable and thus void the new law, but he was driven from the forum by Caesar's armed supporters. His lictors had their fasces broken, two high magistrates accompanying him were wounded, and he had a bucket of excrement thrown over him. In fear of his life, he retired to his house for the rest of the year, issuing occasional proclamations of bad omens. These attempts proved ineffective in obstructing Caesar's legislation. Roman satirists ever after referred to the year as \"the consulship of Julius and Caesar.\"\n\nWhen Caesar was first elected, the aristocracy tried to limit his future power by allotting the woods and pastures of Italy, rather than the governorship of a province, as his military command duty after his year in office was over. With the help of political allies, Caesar later overturned this, and was instead appointed to govern Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) and Illyricum (southeastern Europe), with Transalpine Gaul (southern France) later added, giving him command of four legions. The term of his governorship, and thus his immunity from prosecution, was set at five years, rather than the usual one. When his consulship ended, Caesar narrowly avoided prosecution for the irregularities of his year in office, and quickly left for his province.\n\nCaesar was still deeply in debt, but there was money to be made as a governor, whether by extortion or by military adventurism. Caesar had four legions under his command, two of his provinces bordered on unconquered territory, and parts of Gaul were known to be unstable. Some of Rome's Gallic allies had been defeated by their rivals at the Battle of Magetobriga, with the help of a contingent of Germanic tribes. The Romans feared these tribes were preparing to migrate south, closer to Italy, and that they had warlike intent. Caesar raised two new legions and defeated these tribes.\n\nIn response to Caesar's earlier activities, the tribes in the north-east began to arm themselves. Caesar treated this as an aggressive move and, after an inconclusive engagement against the united tribes, he conquered the tribes piecemeal. Meanwhile, one of his legions began the conquest of the tribes in the far north, directly opposite Britain. During the spring of 56 BC, the Triumvirs held a conference, as Rome was in turmoil and Caesar's political alliance was coming undone. The Lucca Conference renewed the First Triumvirate and extended Caesar's governorship for another five years. The conquest of the north was soon completed, while a few pockets of resistance remained. Caesar now had a secure base from which to launch an invasion of Britain.\n\nIn 55 BC, Caesar repelled an incursion into Gaul by two Germanic tribes, and followed it up by building a bridge across the Rhine and making a show of force in Germanic territory, before returning and dismantling the bridge. Late that summer, having subdued two other tribes, he crossed into Britain, claiming that the Britons had aided one of his enemies the previous year, possibly the Veneti of Brittany. His intelligence information was poor, and although he gained a beachhead on the coast, he could not advance further, and returned to Gaul for the winter. He returned the following year, better prepared and with a larger force, and achieved more. He advanced inland, and established a few alliances. However, poor harvests led to widespread revolt in Gaul, which forced Caesar to leave Britain for the last time.\nWhile Caesar was in Britain his daughter Julia, Pompey's wife, had died in childbirth. Caesar tried to re-secure Pompey's support by offering him his great-niece in marriage, but Pompey declined. In 53 BC Crassus was killed leading a failed invasion of the east. Rome was on the brink of civil war. Pompey was appointed sole consul as an emergency measure, and married the daughter of a political opponent of Caesar. The Triumvirate was dead.\n\nThough the Gallic tribes were just as strong as the Romans militarily, the internal division among the Gauls guaranteed an easy victory for Caesar. Vercingetorix's attempt in 52 BC to unite them against Roman invasion came too late. He proved an astute commander, defeating Caesar at the Battle of Gergovia, but Caesar's elaborate siege-works at the Battle of Alesia finally forced his surrender. Despite scattered outbreaks of warfare the following year, Gaul was effectively conquered. Plutarch claimed that during the Gallic Wars the army had fought against three million men (of whom one million died, and another million were enslaved), subjugated 300 tribes, and destroyed 800 cities.\n\nIn 50 BC, the Senate (led by Pompey) ordered Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason. On 10 January 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon river (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only a single legion, the Legio XIII Gemina, and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon, Caesar, according to Plutarch and Suetonius, is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander, in Greek, \"the die is cast\". Erasmus, however, notes that the more accurate Latin translation of the Greek imperative mood would be \"\"alea iacta esto\"\", \"let\" the die be cast. Pompey and many of the Senate fled to the south, having little confidence in Pompey's newly raised troops. Pompey, despite greatly outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, did not intend to fight. Caesar pursued Pompey, hoping to capture Pompey before his legions could escape.\n\nPompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him. Heading for Spain, Caesar left Italy under the control of Mark Antony. After an astonishing 27-day route-march, Caesar defeated Pompey's lieutenants, then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Illyria, where, on 10 July 48 BC in the battle of Dyrrhachium, Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. In an exceedingly short engagement later that year, he decisively defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, in Greece on 9 August 48 BC.\n\nIn Rome, Caesar was appointed dictator, with Mark Antony as his Master of the Horse (second in command); Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and then, after 11 days, resigned this dictatorship. Caesar then pursued Pompey to Egypt, arriving soon after the murder of the general. There, Caesar was presented with Pompey's severed head and seal-ring, receiving these with tears. He then had Pompey's assassins put to death.\n\nCaesar then became involved with an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, Cleopatra. Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar sided with Cleopatra. He withstood the Siege of Alexandria and later he defeated the pharaoh's forces at the Battle of the Nile in 47 BC and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated their victory with a triumphal procession on the Nile in the spring of 47 BC. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships, and Caesar was introduced to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian pharaohs.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra were not married. Caesar continued his relationship with Cleopatra throughout his last marriage—in Roman eyes, this did not constitute adultery—and probably fathered a son called Caesarion. Cleopatra visited Rome on more than one occasion, residing in Caesar's villa just outside Rome across the Tiber.\n\nLate in 48 BC, Caesar was again appointed dictator, with a term of one year. After spending the first months of 47 BC in Egypt, Caesar went to the Middle East, where he annihilated the king of Pontus; his victory was so swift and complete that he mocked Pompey's previous victories over such poor enemies. On his way to Pontus, Caesar visited Tarsus from 27 to 29 May 47 BC (25–27 May), where he met enthusiastic support, but where, according to Cicero, Cassius was planning to kill him at this point. Thence, he proceeded to Africa to deal with the remnants of Pompey's senatorial supporters. He was defeated by Titus Labienus at Ruspina on 4 January 46 BC but recovered to gain a significant victory at Thapsus on 6 April 46 BC over Cato, who then committed suicide.\n\nAfter this victory, he was appointed dictator for 10 years. Pompey's sons escaped to Spain; Caesar gave chase and defeated the last remnants of opposition in the Battle of Munda in March 45 BC. During this time, Caesar was elected to his third and fourth terms as consul in 46 BC and 45 BC (this last time without a colleague).\n\nWhile he was still campaigning in Spain, the Senate began bestowing honours on Caesar. Caesar had not proscribed his enemies, instead pardoning almost all, and there was no serious public opposition to him. Great games and celebrations were held in April to honour Caesar's victory at Munda. Plutarch writes that many Romans found the triumph held following Caesar's victory to be in poor taste, as those defeated in the civil war had not been foreigners, but instead fellow Romans. On Caesar's return to Italy in September 45 BC, he filed his will, naming his grandnephew Gaius Octavius (Octavian, later known as Augustus Caesar) as his principal heir, leaving his vast estate and property including his name. Caesar also wrote that if Octavian died before Caesar did, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus would be the next heir in succession. In his will, he also left a substantial gift to the citizens of Rome.\n\nBetween his crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the Republic. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. Finally, he wanted to knit together all of the provinces into a single cohesive unit.\n\nThe first goal was accomplished when Caesar defeated Pompey and his supporters. To accomplish the other two goals, he needed to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed, so he assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Finally, he enacted a series of reforms that were meant to address several long-neglected issues, the most important of which was his reform of the calendar.\n\nWhen Caesar returned to Rome, the Senate granted him triumphs for his victories, ostensibly those over Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces, and Juba, rather than over his Roman opponents. Not everything went Caesar's way. When Arsinoe IV, Egypt's former queen, was paraded in chains, the spectators admired her dignified bearing and were moved to pity. Triumphal games were held, with beast-hunts involving 400 lions, and gladiator contests. A naval battle was held on a flooded basin at the Field of Mars. At the Circus Maximus, two armies of war captives, each of 2,000 people, 200 horses, and 20 elephants, fought to the death. Again, some bystanders complained, this time at Caesar's wasteful extravagance. A riot broke out, and only stopped when Caesar had two rioters sacrificed by the priests on the Field of Mars.\n\nAfter the triumph, Caesar set out to pass an ambitious legislative agenda. He ordered a census be taken, which forced a reduction in the grain dole, and decreed that jurors could only come from the Senate or the equestrian ranks. He passed a sumptuary law that restricted the purchase of certain luxuries. After this, he passed a law that rewarded families for having many children, to speed up the repopulation of Italy. Then, he outlawed professional guilds, except those of ancient foundation, since many of these were subversive political clubs. He then passed a term-limit law applicable to governors. He passed a debt-restructuring law, which ultimately eliminated about a fourth of all debts owed.\n\nThe Forum of Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix, was then built, among many other public works. Caesar also tightly regulated the purchase of state-subsidised grain and reduced the number of recipients to a fixed number, all of whom were entered into a special register. From 47 to 44 BC, he made plans for the distribution of land to about 15,000 of his veterans.\n\nThe most important change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The Roman calendar at the time was regulated by the movement of the moon. By replacing it with the Egyptian calendar, based on the sun, Roman farmers were able to use it as the basis of consistent seasonal planting from year to year. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an intercalary/leap day at the end of February every fourth year.\n\nTo bring the calendar into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46 BC (the ordinary intercalary month at the end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the Julian calendar opened on 1 January 45 BC. This calendar is almost identical to the current Western calendar.\n\nShortly before his assassination, he passed a few more reforms. He established a police force, appointed officials to carry out his land reforms, and ordered the rebuilding of Carthage and Corinth. He also extended Latin rights throughout the Roman world, and then abolished the tax system and reverted to the earlier version that allowed cities to collect tribute however they wanted, rather than needing Roman intermediaries. His assassination prevented further and larger schemes, which included the construction of an unprecedented temple to Mars, a huge theatre, and a library on the scale of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nHe also wanted to convert Ostia to a major port, and cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth. Militarily, he wanted to conquer the Dacians and Parthians, and avenge the loss at Carrhae. Thus, he instituted a massive mobilisation. Shortly before his assassination, the Senate named him censor for life and Father of the Fatherland, and the month of Quintilis was renamed July in his honour.\n\nHe was granted further honours, which were later used to justify his assassination as a would-be divine monarch: coins were issued bearing his image and his statue was placed next to those of the kings. He was granted a golden chair in the Senate, was allowed to wear triumphal dress whenever he chose, and was offered a form of semi-official or popular cult, with Mark Antony as his high priest.\n\nThe history of Caesar's political appointments is complex and uncertain. Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, but alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies. He was first appointed dictator in 49 BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days. In 48 BC, he was reappointed dictator, only this time for an indefinite period, and in 46 BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.\n\nIn 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers, which made his person sacrosanct and allowed him to veto the Senate, although on at least one occasion, tribunes did attempt to obstruct him. The offending tribunes in this case were brought before the Senate and divested of their office. This was not the first time Caesar had violated a tribune's sacrosanctity. After he had first marched on Rome in 49 BC, he forcibly opened the treasury, although a tribune had the seal placed on it. After the impeachment of the two obstructive tribunes, Caesar, perhaps unsurprisingly, faced no further opposition from other members of the Tribunician College.\n\nWhen Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, the ranks of the Senate had been severely depleted, so he used his censorial powers to appoint many new senators, which eventually raised the Senate's membership to 900. All the appointments were of his own partisans, which robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made the Senate increasingly subservient to him. To minimise the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law that subjected governors to term limits.\n\nIn 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of \"Prefect of the Morals\", which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical to those of the \"censors\". Thus, he could hold censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks to which the ordinary censors were subject, and he used these powers to fill the Senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the Senate to bestow various titles and honours upon him. He was, for example, given the title of \"Father of the Fatherland\" and \"\"imperator\"\".\n\nCoins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during Senate meetings. Caesar then increased the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters.\n\nCaesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to link more tightly the other provinces of the empire into a single cohesive unit. This addressed the underlying problem that had caused the Social War decades earlier, where persons from outside Rome or Italy did not have citizenship. This process, of fusing the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the Emperor Augustus.\n\nIn February 44 BC, one month before his assassination, he was appointed dictator in perpetuity. Under Caesar, a significant amount of authority was vested in his lieutenants, mostly because Caesar was frequently out of Italy. In October 45 BC, Caesar resigned his position as sole consul, and facilitated the election of two successors for the remainder of the year, which theoretically restored the ordinary consulship, since the constitution did not recognise a single consul without a colleague.\n\nNear the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all consuls and tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the dictator.\n\nOn the Ides of March (15 March; see Roman calendar) of 44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. Several Senators had conspired to assassinate Caesar. Mark Antony, having vaguely learned of the plot the night before from a terrified \"liberator\" named Servilius Casca, and fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters, however, had anticipated this and, fearing that Antony would come to Caesar's aid, had arranged for Trebonius to intercept him just as he approached the portico of the Theatre of Pompey, where the session was to be held, and detain him outside (Plutarch, however, assigns this action of delaying Antony to Brutus Albinus). When he heard the commotion from the Senate chamber, Antony fled.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, as Caesar arrived at the Senate, Tillius Cimber presented him with a petition to recall his exiled brother. The other conspirators crowded round to offer support. Both Plutarch and Suetonius say that Caesar waved him away, but Cimber grabbed his shoulders and pulled down Caesar's tunic. Caesar then cried to Cimber, \"Why, this is violence!\" (\"\"Ista quidem vis est!\"\").\n\nCasca simultaneously produced his dagger and made a glancing thrust at the dictator's neck. Caesar turned around quickly and caught Casca by the arm. According to Plutarch, he said in Latin, \"Casca, you villain, what are you doing?\" Casca, frightened, shouted, \"Help, brother!\" in Greek (\"\", \"\"adelphe, boethei\"\"). Within moments, the entire group, including Brutus, was striking out at the dictator. Caesar attempted to get away, but, blinded by blood, he tripped and fell; the men continued stabbing him as he lay defenceless on the lower steps of the portico. According to Eutropius, around 60 men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal. The dictator's last words are not known with certainty, and are a contested subject among scholars and historians alike. Suetonius reports that others have said Caesar's last words were the Greek phrase \"\" (transliterated as \"\"Kai su, teknon?\"\": \"You too, child?\" in English). However, Suetonius' own opinion was that Caesar said nothing.\n\nPlutarch also reports that Caesar said nothing, pulling his toga over his head when he saw Brutus among the conspirators. The version best known in the English-speaking world is the Latin phrase \"\"Et tu, Brute?\"\" (\"And you, Brutus?\", commonly rendered as \"You too, Brutus?\"); best known from Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", where it actually forms the first half of a macaronic line: \"\"Et tu, Brute?\" Then fall, Caesar.\" This version was already popular when the play was written, as it appears in Richard Edes's Latin play \"Caesar Interfectus\" of 1582 and \"The True Tragedie of Richarde Duke of Yorke & etc.\" of 1595, Shakespeare's source work for other plays.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, after the assassination, Brutus stepped forward as if to say something to his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building. Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: \"People of Rome, we are once again free!\" They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.\nCaesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation, the Temple of Caesar was erected a few years later (at the east side of the main square of the Roman Forum). Only its altar now remains. A life-size wax statue of Caesar was later erected in the forum displaying the 23 stab wounds. A crowd who had gathered there started a fire, which badly damaged the forum and neighbouring buildings. In the ensuing chaos, Mark Antony, Octavian (later Augustus Caesar), and others fought a series of five civil wars, which would end in the formation of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe result unforeseen by the assassins was that Caesar's death precipitated the end of the Roman Republic. The Roman middle and lower classes, with whom Caesar was immensely popular and had been since before Gaul, became enraged that a small group of aristocrats had killed their champion. Antony, who had been drifting apart from Caesar, capitalised on the grief of the Roman mob and threatened to unleash them on the \"Optimates\", perhaps with the intent of taking control of Rome himself. To his surprise and chagrin, Caesar had named his grandnephew Gaius Octavius his sole heir (hence the name Octavian), bequeathing him the immensely potent Caesar name and making him one of the wealthiest citizens in the Republic.\nThe crowd at the funeral boiled over, throwing dry branches, furniture, and even clothing on to Caesar's funeral pyre, causing the flames to spin out of control, seriously damaging the Forum. The mob then attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, where they were repelled only with considerable difficulty, ultimately providing the spark for the civil war, fulfilling at least in part Antony's threat against the aristocrats. Antony did not foresee the ultimate outcome of the next series of civil wars, particularly with regard to Caesar's adopted heir. Octavian, aged only 18 when Caesar died, proved to have considerable political skills, and while Antony dealt with Decimus Brutus in the first round of the new civil wars, Octavian consolidated his tenuous position.\n\nTo combat Brutus and Cassius, who were massing an enormous army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's war chests, and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With the passage of the \"lex Titia\" on 27 November 43 BC, the Second Triumvirate was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander Lepidus. It formally deified Caesar as Divus Iulius in 42 BC, and Caesar Octavian henceforth became \"Divi filius\" (\"Son of the divine\").\n\nBecause Caesar's clemency had resulted in his murder, the Second Triumvirate reinstated the practice of proscription, abandoned since Sulla. It engaged in the legally sanctioned killing of a large number of its opponents to secure funding for its 45 legions in the second civil war against Brutus and Cassius. Antony and Octavian defeated them at Philippi.\nAfterward, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's lover, Cleopatra, intending to use the fabulously wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. A third civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This final civil war, culminating in the latter's defeat at Actium in 31 BC and suicide in Egypt in 30 BC, resulted in the permanent ascendancy of Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus, a name conveying religious, rather than political, authority.\n\nJulius Caesar had been preparing to invade Parthia, the Caucasus, and Scythia, and then march back to Germania through Eastern Europe. These plans were thwarted by his assassination. His successors did attempt the conquests of Parthia and Germania, but without lasting results.\n\nJulius Caesar was the first historical Roman to be officially deified. He was posthumously granted the title \"Divus Iulius\" (the divine/deified Julius) by decree of the Roman Senate on 1 January 42 BC. The appearance of a comet during games in his honour was taken as confirmation of his divinity. Though his temple was not dedicated until after his death, he may have received divine honours during his lifetime: and shortly before his assassination, Mark Antony had been appointed as his \"flamen\" (priest). Both Octavian and Mark Antony promoted the cult of\" Divus Iulius\". After the death of Caesar, Octavian, as the adoptive son of Caesar, assumed the title of \"Divi Filius\" (son of a god).\n\nBased on remarks by Plutarch, Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s. Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a parasitic infection in the brain by a tapeworm.\n\nCaesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had absence seizures in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius, who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of hypoglycemia, which can cause epileptoid seizures.\n\nIn 2003, psychiatrist Harbour F. Hodder published what he termed as the \"Caesar Complex\" theory, arguing that Caesar was a sufferer of temporal lobe epilepsy and the debilitating symptoms of the condition were a factor in Caesar's conscious decision to forgo personal safety in the days leading up to his assassination.\n\nA line from Shakespeare has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: \"Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf\". No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.\n\nFrancesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesar's behavioral manifestations—headaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibility—and syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his \"Natural History\" that Caesar's father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.\n\nSuetonius, writing more than a century after Caesar's death, describes Caesar as \"tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes\".\n\nUsing the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters \"J\" and \"U\", Caesar's name would be rendered \"GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR\"; the form \"CAIVS\" is also attested, using the older Roman representation of \"G\" by \"C\". The standard abbreviation was \"C. IVLIVS CÆSAR\", reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform \"Æ\" is a ligature of the letters \"A\" and \"E\", and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.)\n\nIn Classical Latin, it was pronounced [ˈɡaː.i.ʊs ˈjuːl.i.ʊs ˈkae̯sar]. In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training, as was Caesar's principal assassin, Brutus. In Greek, during Caesar's time, his family name was written Καίσαρ (\"Kaísar\"), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German \"Kaiser\".\n\nIn Vulgar Latin, the original diphthong first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel . Then, the plosive before front vowels began, due to palatalization, to be pronounced as an affricate, hence renderings like in Italian and in German regional pronunciations of Latin, as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages, the affricate became a fricative (thus, ) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived.\n\nCaesar's cognomen itself became a title; it was promulgated by the Bible, which contains the famous verse \"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\". The title became \"Kaiser\" in German and Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria, whose reign ended in 1946. This means that for almost two thousand years after Julius Caesar's assassination, there was at least one head of state bearing his name.\n\nBULLET::::- Parents\nBULLET::::- Father Gaius Julius Caesar the Elder (proconsul of Asia in 90s BC)\nBULLET::::- Mother Aurelia (one of the Aurelii Cottae)\n\nBULLET::::- Sisters\nBULLET::::- Julia Major\nBULLET::::- Julia Minor\n\nBULLET::::- Wives\nBULLET::::- First marriage to Cornelia (Cinnilla), from 84 BC until her death in 69 or 68 BC\nBULLET::::- Second marriage to Pompeia, from 67 BC until he divorced her around 61 BC over the Bona Dea scandal\nBULLET::::- Third marriage to Calpurnia, from 59 BC until Caesar's death\n\nBULLET::::- Children\nBULLET::::- Julia, by Cornelia, born in 83 or 82 BC\nBULLET::::- Caesarion, by Cleopatra VII, born 47 BC, and killed at age 17 by Caesar's adopted son Octavianus.\nBULLET::::- \"Posthumously adopted\": Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, his great-nephew by blood (grandson of Julia, his sister), who later became Emperor Augustus.\n\nSuspected Children\nBULLET::::- Marcus Junius Brutus (born 85 BC): The historian Plutarch notes that Caesar believed Brutus to have been his illegitimate son, as his mother Servilia had been Caesar's lover during their youth.

Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar's Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, \"Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar.\" According to Cicero, Bibulus, Gaius Memmius, and others (mainly Caesar's enemies), he had an affair with Nicomedes IV of Bithynia early in his career. The stories were repeated, referring to Caesar as the Queen of Bithynia, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to Cassius Dio, even under oath on one occasion. This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents.\n\nCatullus wrote two poems suggesting that Caesar and his engineer Mamurra were lovers, but later apologised.\n\nMark Antony charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favors. Suetonius described Antony's accusation of an affair with Octavian as political slander. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latin—even Cicero spoke highly of Caesar's rhetoric and style. Only Caesar's war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his \"Anticato\", a document written to defame Cato in response to Cicero's published praise. Poems by Julius Caesar are also mentioned in ancient sources.\n\nBULLET::::- The \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", usually known in English as \"The Gallic Wars,\" seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 50s BC, with the eighth book written by Aulus Hirtius on the last two years.\nBULLET::::- The \"Commentarii de Bello Civili\" (\"The Civil War\"), events of the Civil War from Caesar's perspective, until immediately after Pompey's death in Egypt.\n\nOther works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:\nBULLET::::- \"De Bello Alexandrino\" (\"On the Alexandrine War\"), campaign in Alexandria;\nBULLET::::- \"De Bello Africo\" (\"On the African War\"), campaigns in North Africa; and\nBULLET::::- \"De Bello Hispaniensi\" (\"On the Hispanic War\"), campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThese narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of \"dispatches from the front.\" They were important in shaping Caesar's public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings. As a model of clear and direct Latin style, \"The Gallic Wars\" traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.\n\nThe texts written by Caesar, an autobiography of the most important events of his public life, are the most complete primary source for the reconstruction of his biography. However, Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind, so historians must filter the exaggerations and bias contained in it. The Roman emperor Augustus began a cult of personality of Caesar, which described Augustus as Caesar's political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by the Octavian traditions, such as when Caesar's epoch is considered a turning point in the history of the Roman Empire. Still, historians try to filter the Octavian bias.\n\nMany rulers in history became interested in the historiography of Caesar. Napoleon III wrote the scholarly work \"Histoire de Jules César\", which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. Charles VIII ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the \"Gallic Wars\" in 1480. Charles V ordered a topographic study in France, to place The Gallic Wars in context; which created forty high-quality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent catalogued the surviving editions of the \"Commentaries\", and translated them to Turkish language. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively; Louis XIV retranslated the first one afterwards.\n\nJulius Caesar is seen as the main example of \"Caesarism\", a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government. Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism. The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Et tu, Brute?\"\nBULLET::::- Gaius Julius Caesar (name)\nBULLET::::- \"Julius Caesar\", a play by William Shakespeare ( 1599)\nBULLET::::- \"Giulio Cesare\", an opera by Handel, 1724\nBULLET::::- \"Veni, vidi, vici\"\nBULLET::::- Caesareum of Alexandria\n\nBULLET::::- Dickinson College Commentaries: Selections from the \"Gallic War\"\nBULLET::::- Forum Romanum Index to Caesar's works online in Latin and translation\n\nBULLET::::- Appian, Book 13 (English translation)\nBULLET::::- Cassius Dio, Books 37–44 (English translation)\nBULLET::::- Plutarch on Antony (English translation, Dryden edition)\nBULLET::::- Plutarch: The Life of Julius Caesar (English translation)\nBULLET::::- Plutarch: The Life of Mark Antony (English translation)\nBULLET::::- Suetonius: The Life of Julius Caesar.

{"id": "15925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15925", "title": "Jacobitism", "text": "Jacobitism\n\nJacobitism ( , ) is a name commonly used for the movement that supported the restoration of the House of Stuart to the British throne. It is derived from \"Jacobus\", the Latin version of \"James\". \n\nWhen James II and VII went into exile after the 1688 Glorious Revolution, the Parliament of England argued he abandoned the English throne and offered it to his Protestant daughter Mary II and her husband William III. The Scottish Convention claimed he 'forfeited' the throne of Scotland by his actions, listed in the Articles of Grievances.\n\nThe assertion that monarchs gained legitimacy from Parliament, rather than God, or divine right became a key ideological difference between Jacobites and their opponents. However, Jacobitism was a complex mix of ideas, many opposed by the Stuarts themselves; in Ireland, it meant tolerance for Catholicism, which James supported, but also Irish autonomy and reversing the 17th century land settlements, which he opposed. In 1745, Scottish Jacobites opposed the 1707 Union and divine right; Prince Charles supported both. \n\nOutside Ireland, Jacobitism was strongest in the western Scottish Highlands, Perthshire and Aberdeenshire and areas of Northern England with a high proportion of Catholics such as western Lancashire and Northumberland. Sympathisers were also found in parts of Wales, and in the West Midlands and South West England, to some degree overlapping with the Royalist strongholds of the Civil War era. The movement had an international dimension; several European powers sponsored the Jacobites as an extension of larger conflicts, while many Jacobite exiles served in foreign armies.\n\nIn addition to the 1689–1691 Williamite War in Ireland and the simultaneous conflict in Scotland, there were open Jacobite revolts in Scotland and England in 1715, 1719 and 1745-6; abortive French-backed invasion attempts in 1708 and 1744; and several unsuccessful plots. While the 1745 rising was briefly a serious crisis for the British state, leading to the recall of British troops from Continental Europe, its collapse and the 1748 withdrawal of French support ended Jacobitism as a serious political movement.\n\nThe first Stuart king, James VI and I, claimed both his right to the throne and authority came from God, or divine right. This concept, combined with his vision of a centralised, Unionist state, was followed by his successors with remarkable consistency, whether Catholic or Protestant. \n\nAttempts by his son Charles I to create a unified, Protestant church across all three kingdoms and rule without Parliament led to the 1639-1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Political and religious tensions persisted after the restoration of Charles II in 1660 but despite his Catholicism, James II and VII became king in 1685 with widespread support in all three kingdoms. In England and Scotland, the majority wanted stability and since James' heir was his Protestant daughter Mary, a Catholic monarch seemed a short-term issue. \n\nThe situation was different in Ireland, where approximately 75% of the population was Catholic. Confiscations had reduced the percentage of Catholic-owned land from 90% in 1600 to around 22% by 1685, while a series of proclamations after 1673 deprived them of the right to bear arms or hold public office. When Tyrconnell was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, he began building a Catholic establishment that could survive James but the speed of the process began to destabilise all three kingdoms. \n\nConcern over James' policies changed to full-blown rebellion in June 1688, with the birth of a Catholic heir and riots in England and Scotland following the acquittal of the Seven Bishops. In 1685, many feared civil war if James were bypassed; by 1688, it seemed only his removal could prevent one. Mary and her husband William of Orange were invited to assume the English throne and William landed in Brixham on 5November with about 14,000 troops. James was deserted by his army and went into exile in France on 23 December; by May 1689, William and Mary had been installed as joint monarchs of England and Scotland. \n\nWith Tyrconnell retaining control over most of Ireland, James and 6,000 French troops landed on 12 March 1689; this began the War in Ireland, with a subsidiary Scottish rising led by Viscount Dundee. In May, the so-called Patriot Parliament repealed the Cromwellian land seizures, confiscated land from those who supported William and proclaimed Ireland a 'distinct kingdom' from England. All these measures were subsequently reversed. \n\nJacobite defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 coincided with French naval victory at Beachy Head. James returned to France to urge an immediate invasion but by August, the Anglo-Dutch fleet had regained command of the sea. His departure permanently damaged his image in Ireland, although the war continued until the 1691 Treaty of Limerick. \n\nThe 1701 Act of Settlement stipulated a Protestant heir to the English throne. When Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702, her heir was the distantly related but Protestant George I, not her Catholic half brother James. The 1707 Act of Union which combined England and Scotland into Great Britain extended this to Scotland and Ireland. Anne viewed this as the unified Protestant kingdom her great-grandfather, grandfather, father and uncle all failed to achieve.\n\nThe motivation and composition of Jacobite support varied widely during its existence and across the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. This has led historians to characterise the movement in a variety of ways, including as a revolutionary extension of anti-Court, 'Country' ideology, an aristocratic reaction against a growth in executive power, a simple conflict between feudalism and capitalism, or as a product of nationalist feeling in Scotland and Ireland. \n\nIrish Jacobite demands included religious toleration, legislative autonomy and land ownership, issues that pre-dated the cause and continued long after it ended, while participants in the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland showed little enthusiasm for James. Some historians claim it is difficult to identify what was distinctly 'Jacobite' in Irish support for the Stuarts.\n\nBoth Charles I and Charles II viewed Ireland as subservient to England, and James conceded demands for an autonomous Irish parliament with great reluctance. Much of the Protestant Church of Ireland backed James in 1689, including eight of its bishops; significant numbers later became Non-Jurors, the most famous being propagandist Charles Leslie. For various reasons, James insisted on retaining the church, while his claim to appoint Catholic bishops and clergy led to conflict with Pope Innocent XI, who allegedly helped finance William's campaign. \n\nThe most divisive internal issue faced by the 1689 Patriot Parliament was land; the proportion owned by Irish Catholics had declined from 90% in 1600 to 22% in 1685, most of it held by the Old English elite. Despite objections from James, Parliament passed legislation restoring the position to that prevailing in 1652 but this and other acts were declared void after the October 1691 Treaty of Limerick; by 1702, less than 9% was in Catholic hands. \nDefeat in 1691 led to legal formalisation of the Protestant Ascendancy; measures passed by the 1689 Parliament were annulled and 14,000 Jacobite soldiers went into exile. Although they soon ceased to exist as an autonomous force, foreign service remained common among Irish Catholics before it was banned in 1745. Until 1766, the Stuarts nominally controlled the appointment of Catholic clergy in Ireland but their residence in Rome meant these were largely made by the Vatican; Irish Jacobitism became characterised by conservative, militant Catholicism. \n\nIn 1685, writers like Ó Bruadair welcomed James as the 'true king', who would ensure the supremacy of Catholicism and the Irish language. His departure from Ireland in 1690 led to a populist perspective of James as a traitor, while upper-class literati like Charles O'Kelly portrayed him as 'the rightful king who was banished (and) destined to return'. This dynamic continued after his death in 1701, summarised in a proverb of the period; 'As bad as James was, to be without him is worse.' In 1715, Eoin O Callanain described his son James Stuart as \"\"taoiseach na nGaoidheal\"\" or \"chieftain of the Gaels\". However, the exact nature of the link between Gaelic literature and Jacobitism in the 18th century is unclear. \n\nWhile support for autonomy and Catholic emancipation continued throughout the 18th century, Ireland took no part in the 1715 or 1745 Risings. Many of the remaining Catholic gentry renounced support for the Stuarts, creating organisations like the Catholic Convention who worked within the existing state for redress of grievances. After the death of Charles in 1788, remaining Jacobites cast the French First Republic in the role of liberator previously occupied by the Stuarts.\n\nWhile there was a clear link in England and Wales between Catholicism and Jacobitism, their numbers were too small to have any real impact: by 1720, there were only an estimated 115,000 in the two countries. The government actively sought reconciliation by not enforcing the Penal Laws and from 1719 once more permitting 'occasional conformity', allowing Catholics to hold official positions in return for attendance at yearly Anglican services. Most Catholic members of the gentry were clustered in Lancashire and Northumberland: many of these joined the 1715 rebellion but avoided commitment in 1745.\n\nThere was limited support for the Stuarts from Nonjurors, Church of England clergy who refused on principle to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary while James still lived. For the vast majority, this was a matter of conscience, not political; in 1691, the English Parliament formally removed or 'deprived' Non-Juring bishops but the clergy was largely left alone for this reason.\n\nTwo of the deprived bishops, Robert Frampton and Thomas Ken, continued to attend Church of England services and most Non-Jurors opposed Sancroft's decision in 1693 to create new bishops. This was driven by his belief Parliament had no right to interfere with clerical appointments, rather than Jacobitism. The prospect of a formal schism led many moderates to return to the church and by 1725, the Non-Juring church had ceased to be a significant force.\n\nAlthough many Tories were Jacobite sympathisers, most were fervently anti-Catholic and the official Tory doctrine of passive obedience to the monarch discouraged active support of the exiled Stuarts. Ongoing Tory disaffection often derived from policy differences with the Whigs, not doctrinaire Stuart loyalism. \n\nIn 1714, most Tories tried to reconcile with the new regime; the most prominent, Bolingbroke, was forced into exile by his own poor political judgement. Even the Earl of Mar, who led the 1715 rising, observed \"Jacobitisme, which they used to brand the Tories with, is now I presum out of doors\", expressing his hope that \"the King has better understanding than to make himself but King of one partie\". Ideologically committed Jacobites remained a minority in the party, alongside a larger number frustrated by their exclusion from power under the Hanoverian monarchs.\n\n'Popular' Jacobitism, expressed in riots and the adoption of Stuart or Royalist symbols on Restoration Day, was associated with Tory towns such as Bristol. This was often encouraged by Tory gentry at times of political instability, as in the West Midlands in 1715, but was complex. Areas that experienced widespread rioting during the coronation of George I in 1714 were largely untouched in 1715.\n\nThe main sources of Scottish Jacobite support are often portrayed as Gaelic-speaking Stuart loyalist Highlanders or Catholics. In reality, Scots Catholics were a tiny minority in 1688; by 1745, it is estimated they comprised only 16,500 out of a Scots population of over 1.5 million, although the proportion tended to be higher among the gentry. Highlanders formed a high proportion of Jacobite military forces due to the feudal nature of clan society, which obliged tenants to provide their landlord with military service. In 1689, 1715 and 1745, the vast majority of Highland recruits came from a small number of western clans whose leaders joined the rebellion.\n\nAfter the 1719 Rising, new laws imposed penalties on Non-Juring clergy, those who refused to swear allegiance to the Hanoverian regime, rather than the Stuarts. While Non-jurors quickly declined in England, doctrinal differences with the majority Church of Scotland meant the Scottish community became the separate Scottish Episcopal Church. Many who participated in the 1715 and 1745 Rising came from Episcopalian congregations, whose governance structures suited the hierarchical nature of clan society. \n\nThe single biggest driver in Scotland was opposition to the 1707 Union, a feeling that the London government did not have their best interests at heart. In 1745, the pro-Union Jacobite Lord George Murray claimed to be motivated by government \"corruption and bribery\" and against \"wars entered into for and on account of the Electors of Hanover\". Despite their own support for a unified state, the Stuarts tried to appeal to those unhappy with Union, either for economic reasons or otherwise. This was particularly strong in Edinburgh, former location of the Scottish Parliament, although opposition to Union did not imply support for the Stuarts.\n\nHistorian Frank McLynn identifies seven primary drivers in Jacobitism, noting that while the movement contained \"sincere men [..] who aimed solely to restore the Stuarts\", it was \"rarely [...] a positive doctrine\" and \"provided a source of legitimacy for political dissent of all kinds\". \n\nThe four primary ideological tenets were the divine right of kings, their accountability to God, not man or Parliament, inalienable hereditary right, and the duty of subjects to obey. These motifs drew on theology shared by Non-Jurors, Anglicans and Scots Episcopalians and provided an ideological framework for recruits. However, they were neither unique to nor consistently held within the Jacobite community; by 1745 the promotion of hereditary and indefeasible right was restricted largely to a few Scots Jacobites, notably Lord Pitsligo.\n\nIn principle, the Jacobite concept of divine right invalidated the 1689 Settlement, since only God could remove kings, not Parliament, but their Catholicism was an insuperable obstacle to most Protestants. In both England and Scotland, the vast majority of those who refused to swear allegiance to William III did so on grounds of conscience, rather than for political reasons. The issue receded when James died in 1701; after all, William had a Stuart mother, a Stuart wife and was succeeded by his Stuart sister-in-law. Estimates of English support in particular confused indifference to the Hanoverians with enthusiasm for the Stuarts, although the perception that the Hanoverian connection involved Britain in continental wars drove some dissent.\n\nAfter the Act of Settlement, Jacobite propagandists removed the legitimist element and began to focus on themes such as opposition to a standing army, electoral corruption and social injustice. By the 1750s Charles himself promised triannual parliaments, disbanding the army and legal guarantees on press freedom. Such tactics broadened their appeal but also carried risks, since they could always be undercut by a government prepared to offer similar concessions. In 1745, many Scots Jacobites sought to reverse the 1707 Union, not restore the Stuarts; after Prestonpans, they preferred to negotiate, not invade England. \n\nMore generally, Jacobite theorists reflected broader currents in Enlightenment thought, appealing to those attracted to a monarchist solution to perceived modern decadence. Populist songs and tracts presented the Stuart monarch as a king capable of putting right a wide range of ills and restoring social harmony; a man who continued to eat English beef and consume English beer in exile. While particularly calculated to appeal to Tories, the wide range of themes adopted by Jacobite pamphleteers and agents periodically drew in disaffected Whigs and former radicals: such \"Whig-Jacobites\" were highly valued by James II's exiled court, but seem to have mainly viewed him a potentially weak king from whom it would be easy to extract concessions in the event of a restoration.\n\nWhile Jacobite agents continued in their attempts to recruit the disaffected, the most committed Jacobites were often linked by relatively small family networks, particularly in Scotland; Jacobite activities in areas like Perthshire and Aberdeenshire centred on a limited number of influential families heavily involved in 1715 and 1745. \n\nSome of the most powerful landowning families preserved their establishment loyalties, but maintained traditions of Stuart allegiance by 'permitting' younger sons to become involved in active Jacobitism; in 1745, Lewis Gordon was widely believed to be a proxy for his brother, the Duke of Gordon. Many Jacobite leaders were closely linked to each other and the exile community by marriage or blood. This has led some historians, notably Bruce Lenman, to characterise the Jacobite risings as French-backed coup attempts by a small network drawn from the elite, though this view is not universally accepted. \n\nFamily traditions of Jacobite sympathy were reinforced through objects such as inscribed glassware or rings with hidden symbols, although many of those that survive are in fact 19th century neo-Jacobite creations. Other family heirlooms contained reference to executed Jacobite \"martyrs\", for which the movement preserved an unusual level of veneration. Tartan cloth, widely adopted by the Jacobite army in 1745, was used in portraiture as a symbol of Stuart sympathies, even before the Rising. \nOutside elite social circles, the Jacobite community circulated propaganda and symbolic objects through a network of clubs, print-sellers and pedlars, aimed at the provincial gentry and \"middling sort\". In 1745, Prince Charles ordered commemorative medals and miniature pictures for clandestine distribution. \n\nAmong the more visible elements of the Jacobite community were drinking clubs established in the early 18th century, such as the Scottish Bucks Club or the \"Cycle of the White Rose\", led by Welsh Tory Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. Others included the \"Sea Serjeants\", largely composed of South Wales gentry or the \"Independent Electors of Westminster\" led by the Glamorganshire lawyer David Morgan, executed for his role in 1745. Other than Morgan, the vast majority of their members took no part in the 1745 Rising; Charles later suggested he \"will do for the Welsh Jacobites what they did for me. I will drink their health\".\n\nJacobites relied heavily on symbols, which were impossible to prosecute, the most common being the White rose of York, adopted after 1688 for reasons now unclear. Various origins have been suggested, including its use as an ancient Scottish royal device, its association with James II as Duke of York, or Charles I being styled as the \"White King\". Jacobite military units often used plain white standards and white cockades: green ribbons were another recognised Stuart symbol despite also having Whig associations. Many of these symbols were also employed by Tories to provoke government supporters, such as the oak boughs or oak leaf associated with Charles II. Restoration Day, on May 29, was an occasion for displays of Stuart sympathy, as was \"White Rose Day\" on 10 June, birthday of James Francis Edward Stuart.\n\nThere were Jacobite risings in 1689, 1715, 1719 and 1745. There were also planned French invasions of Britain in support with or in support of the Jacobites in 1708 and 1744.\n\nJacobitism entered permanent decline after the 1745 rebellion. There were a number of reasons for this; longer-term factors included reconciliation of English Catholics and the decline of Non-Juring Anglicans, but exposure in 1745 of the movement's internal divisions was also important. Several key Scottish supporters no longer trusted Charles or French promises of aid, while he considered their decision to turn back at Derby in December 1745 to be a betrayal; James Stuart, in whose name Charles had begun the rebellion, had always regarded the project as irresponsible.\n\nWhile Charles was received as a hero in Paris the French reception behind the scenes was more muted. The French envoy to the Jacobites reported that a Scottish republic might be more advantageous to France in the long term, as a restored Stuart monarch would be liable to return to a strategic alliance with the Dutch. He had a low opinion of Charles, criticising his failure to defend the line of the Spey, described senior Jacobite officer Lochgarry as \"almost a bandit\" (\"presqu'un voleur\") and suggested their commander Lord George Murray was a British spy. Although Charles and Lochiel continued to agitate for another rising, there was little enthusiasm for it at the French court, particularly as the events of 1745-6 had already achieved their strategic objective of ensuring British troops were withdrawn from the Continent.\n\nAfter French victories knocked the Netherlands out of the Seven Years' War, the British offered reasonable peace terms and made the expulsion of Charles from France a precondition of negotiations. Charles ignored French orders to depart, continued to demand military action and support for his extravagant lifestyle and flaunted his presence around Paris as peace negotiations for the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle got under way. After British complaints, the French government lost patience and in December 1748 Charles was seized on his way to the Opéra and briefly jailed before being expelled.\n\nWhile the government response after 1715 had been relatively lenient, its actions in Scotland after the 1745 rising also impacted Jacobite support long-term. Government forces spent several weeks searching for rebels, confiscating cattle and burning non-juring Episcopalian and Catholic meeting houses. The brutality of these measures was driven by a widespread perception among both government officials and Jacobites that another landing was imminent. 3,500 captured Jacobites were indicted for treason: of these, 120 were executed, primarily deserters and members of the Manchester Regiment, 650 died awaiting trial, 900 pardoned and the rest transported. \n\nThe Jacobite lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino and Lovat were beheaded in April 1747, but public opinion was against further trials and the 1747 Act of Indemnity pardoned any remaining prisoners. One of these was Flora MacDonald, whose aristocratic admirers collected over £1,500 for her. Lord Elcho, Lord Murray and Lochiel were excluded from this and died in exile.\n\nNew forts were built, the military road network finally completed and William Roy made the first comprehensive survey of the Highlands. Additional measures were taken to weaken the traditional clan system, which even before 1745 had been under severe stress due to changing economic conditions. The Heritable Jurisdictions Act ended feudal powers exercised by chiefs over their clansmen, depriving the Jacobites of the means to quickly mobilise an army, while the Act of Proscription outlawed Highland dress unless worn in military service; its impact is debated and the law was repealed in 1782.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1751 Charles began exploring a further rising in England; he considered converting to Anglicanism, a proposal that had outraged his father James when previously suggested. In 1750 he secretly visited London: the English Jacobites were clear that they would do nothing without foreign backing, which despite Charles's overtures to Frederick II of Prussia seemed unlikely.\n\nA plot to capture or assassinate George II, headed by Alexander Murray of Elibank, eventually stalled but not before Charles had sent two exiled Scots as agents. One was Archibald Cameron, responsible for recruiting the Cameron regiment in 1745: he was allegedly betrayed by his own clansmen on returning to Scotland and executed on 7 June 1753. In a 1754 dispute with the English conspirators, a drunken and increasingly desperate Charles threatened to publish their names for having \"betrayed\" him; most remaining English sympathisers now left the cause.\n\nIn 1759 French naval defeats at Lagos and Quiberon Bay forced them to abandon a planned invasion of Britain, which would have placed Charles on the throne. It is often considered the last realistic chance for the Jacobites. With its passing, Charles collapsed yet further into alcoholism and was soon entirely abandoned by the French government, who saw little further use for him. The English Jacobites stopped sending funds, and by 1760 Charles, who had returned to Catholicism, was relying on the Papacy to support his lifestyle in Rome.\n\nIn 1766, when Old Pretender James (VIII/III) Edward Stuart died, the Holy See refused to recognise \"Bonnie\" Prince Charles as the lawful sovereign of Great Britain, thus depriving him of his most powerful remaining support, the French support being long gone. In 1788, the Scottish Catholics swore allegiance to the House of Hanover, and resolved two years later to pray for King George by name.\n\nWhen Charles died in 1788 the Stuart claim to the throne passed to his younger brother Henry, who had become a Cardinal, and who now styled himself King Henry IX of England. After falling into financial difficulty during the French Revolution, he was granted a stipend by George III. However, he never actually surrendered his claims to the throne, though all former supporters of Jacobitism had stopped funding.\nFollowing the death of Henry in 1807, the Jacobite claims passed to those excluded by the Act of Settlement: initially to the House of Savoy (1807–1840), then to the Modenese branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine (1840–1919), and finally to the House of Wittelsbach (1919–present). Franz, Duke of Bavaria is the current Jacobite heir. Neither he nor any of his predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim. Henry, Charles and James are memorialised in the Monument to the Royal Stuarts in the Vatican.\n\nWhat began with the English parliament asserting a new authority and William looking to expand alliances against France quickly developed into a major distraction, with William being forced to focus attention on Ireland and Scotland, and parliament having to fund the armies needed to overcome the Jacobites. This distraction helped keep Britain from intervening on the continent and contributed to twenty years of peace in Europe, while continuing unrest forced the British state to develop repressive strategies with networks of spies and informers as well as increasing its standing army. While Jacobitism increasingly appealed to the disaffected, it inherently bowed to higher authority and thus reinforced the social order. It left the British state strengthened to deal with the more revolutionary movements that developed later in the 18th century.\n\nJacobitism is celebrated in many folk songs, including those by nineteenth century Scots poets such as Alicia Spottiswoode and Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne (whose \"Bonnie Charlie\" remains popular). The Corries were well-known for singing this type of music. One of the best known songs is Mo Ghile Mear by Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill which has been sung by many artists including Sting. Additionally, Jacobitism became the subject of romantic poetry and literature, notably the work of Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott.\n\nWalter Scott, author of \"Waverley\", a story of the 1745 rebellion, combined romantic Jacobitism with an appreciation of the practical benefits of the Hanoverian government, and in 1822 he arranged a pageantry of reinvented Scottish traditions for the visit of King George IV to Scotland when George IV visited Edinburgh and dressed as a kilted successor to his distant relative Charles Stuart. The tartan pageantry was immensely popular and the kilt became Scotland's National Dress.\n\nThere was a brief revival of political Jacobitism in the late 1880s and into the 1890s. A number of Jacobite clubs and societies were formed, starting with the Order of the White Rose founded by Bertram Ashburnham in 1886. In 1890, Herbert Vivian and Ruaraidh Erskine co-founded a weekly newspaper, \"The Whirlwind\", that espoused a Jacobite political view. Vivian, Erskine and Melville Henry Massue formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891, which lasted for several years. Vivian went on to stand for Parliament four times on a Jacobite platform – though he failed to be elected each time. The revival largely came to an end with the First World War and the various societies of the time are now represented by the Royal Stuart Society.\n\nJacobitism has been a popular subject for historical novels, and for speculative and humorous fiction.\n\nBULLET::::- The historical novels \"Waverley\" (1814) and \"Rob Roy\" (1817) by Sir Walter Scott focus on the first and second Jacobite rebellions.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Kidnapped\" (1886) is a historical fiction adventure novel by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson that features the intrigues of Jacobite troubles in Scotland.\n\nBULLET::::- In the 1920s, D.

{"id": "15927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15927", "title": "J. G. Ballard", "text": "J. G. Ballard\n\nJames Graham Ballard (15 November 193019 April 2009) was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist who first became associated with the New Wave of science fiction for his post-apocalyptic novels such as \"The Wind from Nowhere\" (1961) and \"The Drowned World\" (1962). In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or \"condensed novels\"), such as those collected in the controversial \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial \"Crash\" (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and \"High-Rise\" (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos.\n\nWhile much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative, he became best known for his relatively conventional war novel, \"Empire of the Sun\" (1984), a semi-autobiographical account of a young British boy's experiences in Shanghai during Japanese occupation. Described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the best British novel about the Second World War\", the story was adapted into a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg starring Christian Bale. In the following decades until his death in 2009, Ballard's work shifted toward the form of the traditional crime novel. Several of his earlier works have been adapted into films, including David Cronenberg's controversial 1996 adaptation of \"Crash\" and Ben Wheatley's 2015 adaptation of \"High-Rise\".\n\nThe literary distinctiveness of Ballard's fiction has given rise to the adjective \"Ballardian\", defined by the \"Collins English Dictionary\" as \"resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments\". The \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with \"eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies\".\n\nBallard's father was a chemist at a Manchester-based textile firm, the Calico Printers' Association, and became chairman and managing director of its subsidiary in Shanghai, the China Printing and Finishing Company. His mother was Edna, Johnstone. Ballard was born and raised in the Shanghai International Settlement, an area under foreign control where people \"lived an American style of life\". He was sent to the Cathedral School, the Anglican Holy Trinity Church near the Bund, Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ballard's family were forced to evacuate their suburban home temporarily and rent a house in central Shanghai to avoid the shells fired by Chinese and Japanese forces.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Hong Kong, the Japanese occupied the International Settlement in Shanghai. In early 1943, they began to intern Allied civilians, and Ballard was sent to the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center with his parents and younger sister. He spent over two years, the remainder of World War II, in the internment camp. His family lived in a small area in G block, a two-story residence for 40 families. He attended school in the camp, the teachers being camp inmates from a number of professions. As he explained later in his autobiography \"Miracles of Life\", these experiences formed the basis of \"Empire of the Sun\", although Ballard exercised considerable artistic licence in writing the book, such as the removal of his parents from the bulk of the story.\n\nIt has been supposed that Ballard's exposure to the atrocities of war at an impressionable age explains the apocalyptic and violent nature of much of his fiction. Martin Amis wrote that \"Empire of the Sun\" \"gives shape to what shaped him.\" However, Ballard's own account of the experience was more nuanced: \"I don't think you can go through the experience of war without one's perceptions of the world being forever changed. The reassuring stage set that everyday reality in the suburban west presents to us is torn down; you see the ragged scaffolding, and then you see the truth beyond that, and it can be a frightening experience.\" But also: \"I have—I won't say \"happy\"—not unpleasant memories of the camp. [...] I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on—but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time!\" Ballard later became an atheist.\n\nIn late 1945, after the end of the war, his mother returned to Britain with Ballard and his sister on the SS \"Arawa\". They lived in the outskirts of Plymouth, and he attended The Leys School in Cambridge. He won an essay prize whilst at the school but did not contribute to the school magazine. After a couple of years his mother and sister returned to China, rejoining Ballard's father, leaving Ballard to live with his grandparents when not boarding at school. In 1949 he went on to study medicine at King's College, Cambridge, with the intention of becoming a psychiatrist.\n\nAt university, Ballard was writing avant-garde fiction heavily influenced by psychoanalysis and surrealist painters. At this time, he wanted to become a writer as well as pursue a medical career. In May 1951, when Ballard was in his second year at Cambridge, his short story \"The Violent Noon\", a Hemingwayesque pastiche written to please the contest's jury, won a crime story competition and was published in the student newspaper \"Varsity\".\n\nEncouraged by the publication of his story and realising that clinical medicine would not leave him time to write, Ballard abandoned his medical studies, and in October 1951 he enrolled at Queen Mary College to read English Literature. However, he was asked to leave at the end of the year. Ballard then worked as a copywriter for an advertising agency and as an encyclopaedia salesman. He kept writing short fiction but found it impossible to get published.\n\nIn spring 1954 Ballard joined the Royal Air Force and was sent to the Royal Canadian Air Force flight-training base in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada. There he discovered science fiction in American magazines. While in the RAF, he also wrote his first science fiction story, \"Passport to Eternity\", as a pastiche and summary of the American science fiction he had read. The story did not see publication until 1962.\n\nBallard left the RAF in 1955 after thirteen months and returned to England. In 1955 he married Helen Mary Matthews and settled in Chiswick, the first of their three children being born the following year. He made his science fiction debut in 1956 with two short stories, \"Escapement\" and \"Prima Belladonna\", published in the December 1956 issues of \"New Worlds\" and \"Science Fantasy\" respectively. The editor of \"New Worlds\", Edward J. Carnell, would remain an important supporter of Ballard's writing and would publish nearly all of his early stories.\n\nFrom 1958 Ballard worked as assistant editor on the scientific journal \"Chemistry and Industry\". His interest in art led to his involvement in the emerging Pop Art movement, and in the late fifties he exhibited a number of collages that represented his ideas for a new kind of novel. Ballard's avant-garde inclinations did not sit comfortably in the science fiction mainstream of that time, which held attitudes he considered philistine. Briefly attending the 1957 Science Fiction Convention in London, Ballard left disillusioned and demoralised and did not write another story for a year. By the late 1960s, however, he had become an editor of the avant-garde \"Ambit\" magazine, which was more in keeping with his aesthetic ideals.\n\nIn 1960 Ballard moved with his family to the middle-class London suburb of Shepperton in Surrey, where he lived for the rest of his life and which would later give rise to his moniker as the \"Seer of Shepperton\". Finding that commuting to work did not leave him time to write, Ballard decided he had to make a break and become a full-time writer. He wrote his first novel, \"The Wind from Nowhere\", over a two-week holiday simply to gain a foothold as a professional writer, not intending it as a \"serious novel\"; in books published later, it is omitted from the list of his works. When it was successfully published in January 1962, he resigned from his job at \"Chemistry and Industry\", and from then on supported himself and his family as a writer.\n\nLater that year his second novel, \"The Drowned World\", was published, establishing Ballard as a notable figure in the fledgling New Wave movement of science fiction. Collections of his stories started getting published, and he began a period of great literary productivity, while pushing to expand the scope of acceptable material for science fiction with such stories as \"The Terminal Beach\".\n\nIn 1964 Ballard's wife Mary died suddenly of pneumonia, leaving him to raise their three children—James, Fay and Bea Ballard—by himself. Ballard never remarried; however, a few years later his friend and fellow author Michael Moorcock introduced him to Claire Walsh, who became his partner for the rest of his life (he died at her London residence), and is often referred to in his writings as \"Claire Churchill\". Walsh, who worked in publishing during the 1960s and 70s, was a sounding board for many of his story ideas, and introduced him to the expat community in the south of France which formed the basis of several novels.\n\nAfter the profound shock of his wife's death, Ballard began in 1965 to write the stories that became \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", while continuing to produce stories within the science fiction genre.\nIn 1967 Algis Budrys listed Ballard, Brian W. Aldiss, Roger Zelazny, and Samuel R. Delany as \"an earthshaking new kind of\" writers, and leaders of the New Wave. \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1969) proved controversial—it was the subject of an obscenity trial, and in the United States, publisher Doubleday destroyed almost the entire print run before it was distributed—but it gained Ballard recognition as a literary writer. It remains one of his iconic works, and was filmed in 2001.\n\nA chapter of \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" is titled \"Crash!\", and in 1970 Ballard organised an exhibition of crashed cars at the New Arts Laboratory, simply called \"Crashed Cars\". The crashed vehicles were displayed without commentary, inspiring vitriolic responses and vandalism. In both the story and the art exhibition, Ballard dealt with the sexual potential of car crashes, a preoccupation he also explored in a short film in which he appeared with Gabrielle Drake in 1971. His fascination with the topic culminated in the novel \"Crash\" in 1973. The main character of \"Crash\" is called James Ballard and lives in Shepperton, though other biographical details do not match the writer, and curiosity about the relationship between the character and his author increased when Ballard suffered a serious automobile accident shortly after completing the novel.\n\nRegardless of real-life basis, \"Crash\", like \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", was also controversial upon publication. In 1996, the film adaptation by David Cronenberg was met by a tabloid uproar in the UK, with the \"Daily Mail\" campaigning actively for it to be banned. In the years following the initial publication of \"Crash\", Ballard produced two further novels: 1974's \"Concrete Island\", about a man who becomes stranded in the waste area of a high-speed motorway, and \"High-Rise\", about a modern luxury high rise apartment building's descent into tribal warfare.\n\nAlthough Ballard published several novels and short story collections throughout the seventies and eighties, his breakthrough into the mainstream came only with \"Empire of the Sun\" in 1984, based on his years in Shanghai and the Lunghua internment camp. It became a best-seller, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and awarded the Guardian Fiction Prize and James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. It made Ballard known to a wider audience, although the books that followed failed to achieve the same degree of success. \"Empire of the Sun\" was filmed by Steven Spielberg in 1987, starring a young Christian Bale as Jim (Ballard). Ballard himself appears briefly in the film, and he has described the experience of seeing his childhood memories reenacted and reinterpreted as bizarre.\n\nBallard continued to write until the end of his life, and also contributed occasional journalism and criticism to the British press. Of his later novels, \"Super-Cannes\" (2000) was particularly well received, winning the regional Commonwealth Writers' Prize. These later novels often marked a move away from science fiction, instead engaging with elements of a traditional crime novel. Ballard was offered a CBE in 2003, but refused, calling it \"a Ruritanian charade that helps to prop up our top-heavy monarchy\". In June 2006, he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, which metastasised to his spine and ribs. The last of his books published in his lifetime was the autobiography \"Miracles of Life\", written after his diagnosis. His final published short story, \"The Dying Fall\", appeared in the 1996 issue 106 of \"Interzone\", a British sci-fi magazine. It was reproduced in \"The Guardian\" on 25 April 2009.\n\nIn October 2008, before his death, Ballard's literary agent Margaret Hanbury bought an outline for a book by Ballard with the working title \"Conversations with My Physician: The Meaning, if Any, of Life\" to the Frankfurt Book Fair. The physician in question is oncologist Professor Jonathan Waxman of Imperial College, London, who was treating Ballard for prostate cancer. While it was to be in part a book about cancer, and Ballard's struggle with it, it reportedly was to move on to broader themes. In April 2009 \"The Guardian\" reported that HarperCollins announced that Ballard's \"Conversations with My Physician\" could not be finished and plans to publish it were abandoned. In 2013, a 17-page untitled typescript listed as \"Vermilion Sands short story in draft\" in the British Library catalogue and edited into an 8,000-word text by Bernard Sigaud appeared in a short-lived French reissue of the collection () under the title \"Le labyrinthe Hardoon\" as the first story of the cycle, tentatively dated \"late 1955/early 1956\" by Sigaud and others.\n\nIn June 2010 the British Library acquired Ballard's personal archives under the British government's acceptance in lieu scheme for death duties. The archive contains eighteen holograph manuscripts for Ballard's novels, including the 840-page manuscript for \"Empire of the Sun\", plus correspondence, notebooks, and photographs from throughout his life. In addition, two typewritten manuscripts for \"The Unlimited Dream Company\" are held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWith the exception of his autobiographical novels, Ballard most commonly wrote in the post-apocalyptic dystopia genre.\n\nHis most celebrated novel in this regard is \"Crash\", in which cars symbolise the mechanisation of the world and man's capacity to destroy himself with the technology he creates. The characters (the protagonist, called Ballard, included) become increasingly obsessed with the violent psychosexuality of car crashes in general, and celebrity car crashes in particular. Ballard's disturbing novel was turned into a controversial—and likewise disturbing—cerebral film by David Cronenberg.\n\nParticularly revered among Ballard's admirers is his short story collection \"Vermilion Sands\" (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing for a party of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, phototropic self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically-mediated masochism, these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to \"Vermilion Sands\", Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.\n\nIn a similar vein, his collection \"Memories of the Space Age\" explores many varieties of individual and collective psychological fallout from—and initial deep archetypal motivations for—the American space exploration boom of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nCommentators such as Will Self have described much of his fiction as being concerned with 'idealised gated communities; the affluent, and the ennui of affluence [where] the virtualised world is concretised in the shape of these gated developments.' He added in these fictional settings 'there is no real pleasure to be gained; sex is commodified and devoid of feeling and there is no relationship with the natural world. These communities then implode into some form of violence.' Budrys, however, mocked his fiction as \"call[ing] for people who don't think ... to be the protagonist of a J. G. Ballard novel, or anything more than a very minor character therein, you must have cut yourself off from the entire body of scientific education\".\n\nIn addition to his novels, Ballard made extensive use of the short story form. Many of his earliest published works in the 1950s and 1960s were short stories, including influential works like Chronopolis. In an essay on Ballard, Will Wiles notes how his short stories 'have a lingering fascination with the domestic interior, with furnishing and appliances,' adding, 'it's a landscape that he distorts until it shrieks with anxiety'. He concludes that 'what Ballard saw, and what he expressed in his novels, was nothing less than the effect that the technological world, including our built environment, was having upon our minds and bodies.'\n\nOn 13 December 1965, BBC Two screened an adaptation of the short story \"Thirteen to Centaurus\" directed by Peter Potter. The one-hour drama formed part of the first season of \"Out of the Unknown\" and starred Donald Houston as Dr. Francis and James Hunter as Abel Granger. In 2003, Ballard's short story \"The Enormous Space\" (first published in the science fiction magazine \"Interzone\" in 1989, subsequently printed in the collection of Ballard's short stories \"War Fever\") was adapted into an hour-long television film for the BBC entitled \"Home\" by Richard Curson Smith, who also directed it. The plot follows a middle class man who chooses to abandon the outside world and restrict himself to his house, becoming a hermit.\n\nBallard is cited as an important forebear of the cyberpunk movement by Bruce Sterling in his introduction to the seminal \"Mirrorshades\" anthology. Ballard's parody of American politics, the pamphlet \"Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan\", which was subsequently included as a chapter in his experimental novel \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", was photocopied and distributed by pranksters at the 1980 Republican National Convention. In the early 1970s, Bill Butler, a bookseller in Brighton, was prosecuted under UK obscenity laws for selling the pamphlet.\n\nIn his 2002 book , the philosopher John Gray acknowledges Ballard as a major influence on his ideas. Ballard described the book as a \"clear-eyed assessment of human nature and our almost unlimited gift for self-delusion.\"\n\nAccording to literary theorist Brian McHale, \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" is a \"postmodernist text based on science fiction topoi.\"\nLee Killough directly cites Ballard's seminal \"Vermilion Sands\" short stories as the inspiration for her collection \"Aventine\", also a backwater resort for celebrities and eccentrics where bizarre or frivolous novelty technology facilitates the expression of dark intents and drives. Terry Dowling's milieu of \"Twilight Beach\" is also influenced by the stories of \"Vermilion Sands\" and other Ballard works.\n\nIn \"Simulacra and Simulation\", Jean Baudrillard hailed \"Crash\" as the \"first great novel of the universe of simulation.\"\n\nBallard also had an interest in the relationship between various media. In the early 1970s, he was one of the trustees of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology.\n\nBallard has had a notable influence on popular music, where his work has been used as a basis for lyrical imagery, particularly amongst British post-punk and industrial groups. Examples include albums such as \"Metamatic\" by John Foxx, various songs by Joy Division (most famously \"Atrocity Exhibition\" from \"Closer\"), \"High Rise\" by Hawkwind, \"Miss the Girl\" by The Creatures (based on \"Crash\"), \"Down in the Park\" by Gary Numan, \"Chrome Injury\" by The Church, \"Drowned World\" by Madonna, \"Warm Leatherette\" by The Normal and \"Atrocity Exhibition\" by Danny Brown.\nSongwriters Trevor Horn and Bruce Woolley credit Ballard's story \"The Sound-Sweep\" with inspiring The Buggles' hit \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", and the Buggles' second album included a song entitled \"Vermillion Sands.\"\nThe 1978 post-punk band Comsat Angels took their name from one of Ballard's short stories. An early instrumental track by British electronic music group The Human League \"4JG\" bears Ballard's initials as a homage to the author (intended as a response to \"2HB\" by Roxy Music).\n\nThe Manic Street Preachers include a sample from an interview with Ballard in their song \"Mausoleum\".\nAdditionally, the Manic Street Preacher's song,\"A billion balconies facing the sun\", is taken from a line in the JG Ballard novel, Cocaine Nights. \nKlaxons named their debut album \"Myths of the Near Future\" after one of Ballard's short story collections. The Sound of Animals Fighting took the name of the song \"The Heraldic Beak of the Manufacturer's Medallion\" from \"Crash\". The song \"Terminal Beach\" by the American band Yacht is a tribute to his short story collection that goes by the same name.\n\nBULLET::::- 1984 Guardian Fiction Prize for \"Empire of the Sun\"\nBULLET::::- 1984 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction for \"Empire of the Sun\"\nBULLET::::- 1984 \"Empire of the Sun\" shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction\nBULLET::::- 1997 De Montfort University Honorary doctorate.\nBULLET::::- 2001 Commonwealth Writers' Prize (Europe & South Asia region) for \"Super-Cannes\"\nBULLET::::- 2008 Golden PEN Award\nBULLET::::- 2009 Royal Holloway University of London Posthumous honorary doctorate.\n\n style=\"width:50%; vertical-align:top;\"\nBULLET::::- \"The Wind from Nowhere\" (1961)\nBULLET::::- \"The Drowned World\" (1962)\nBULLET::::- \"The Burning World\" (1964; also \"The Drought\", 1965)\nBULLET::::- \"The Crystal World\" (1966)\nBULLET::::- \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" (1970, first published as \"Love and Napalm: Export USA\", 1972)\nBULLET::::- \"Crash\" (1973)\nBULLET::::- \"Concrete Island\" (1974)\nBULLET::::- \"High Rise\" (1975)\nBULLET::::- \"The Unlimited Dream Company\" (1979)\nBULLET::::- \"Hello America\" (1981)\n style=\"width:50%; vertical-align:top;\"\nBULLET::::- \"Empire of the Sun\" (1984)\nBULLET::::- \"The Day of Creation\" (1987)\nBULLET::::- \"Running Wild\" (1988)\nBULLET::::- \"The Kindness of Women\" (1991)\nBULLET::::- \"Rushing to Paradise\" (1994)\nBULLET::::- \"Cocaine Nights\" (1996)\nBULLET::::- \"Super-Cannes\" (2000)\nBULLET::::- \"Millennium People\" (2003)\nBULLET::::- \"Kingdom Come\" (2006)\n\n style=\"width:50%; vertical-align:top;\"\nBULLET::::- \"The Voices of Time and Other Stories\" (1962)\nBULLET::::- \"Billennium\" (1962)\nBULLET::::- \"Passport to Eternity\" (1963)\nBULLET::::- \"The Four-Dimensional Nightmare\" (1963)\nBULLET::::- \"The Terminal Beach\" (1964)\nBULLET::::- \"The Impossible Man\" (1966)\nBULLET::::- \"The Overloaded Man\" (1967)\nBULLET::::- \"The Disaster Area\" (1967)\nBULLET::::- \"The Day of Forever\" (1967)\nBULLET::::- \"Vermilion Sands\" (1971)\nBULLET::::- \"Chronopolis and Other Stories\" (1971)\n style=\"width:50%; vertical-align:top;\"\nBULLET::::- \"Low-Flying Aircraft and Other Stories\" (1976)\nBULLET::::- \"The Best of J.

{"id": "15928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15928", "title": "Journalism", "text": "Journalism\n\nJournalism is the production and distribution of reports on events. The word journalism applies to the occupation, as well as citizen journalists who gather and publish information. Journalistic media include print, television, radio, Internet, and, in the past, newsreels.\n\nConcepts of the appropriate role for journalism vary between countries. In some nations, the news media are controlled by government intervention and are not fully independent. In others, the news media are independent of the government but instead operate as private industry motivated by profit. In addition to the varying nature of how media organizations are run and funded, countries may have differing implementations of laws handling the freedom of speech and libel cases.\n\nThe proliferation of the Internet and smartphones has brought significant changes to the media landscape since the turn of the 21st century. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other personal electronic devices, as opposed to the more traditional formats of newspapers, magazines, or television news channels. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.\n\nJournalistic conventions vary by country. In the United States, journalism is produced by media organizations or by individuals. Bloggers are often, but not always, journalists. The Federal Trade Commission requires that bloggers who write about products received as promotional gifts to disclose that they received the products for free. This is intended to eliminate conflicts of interest and protect consumers.\n\nIn the US, many credible news organizations are incorporated entities; have an editorial board, and exhibit separate editorial and advertising departments. Many credible news organizations, or their employees, often belong to and abide by the ethics of professional organizations such as the American Society of News Editors, the Society of Professional Journalists, Investigative Reporters & Editors, Inc., or the Online News Association. Many news organizations also have their own codes of ethics that guide journalists' professional publications. For instance, \"The New York Times\" code of standards and ethics is considered particularly rigorous.\n\nWhen crafting news stories, regardless of the medium, fairness and bias are issues of concern to journalists. Some stories are intended to represent the author's own opinion; others are more neutral or feature balanced points-of-view. In a print newspaper, information is organized into sections and the distinction between opinionated and neutral stories is often clear. Online, many of these distinctions break down. Readers should pay careful attention to headings and other design elements to ensure that they understand the journalist's intent. Opinion pieces are generally written by regular columnists or appear in a section titled \"Op-ed\", while feature stories, breaking news, and hard news stories typically make efforts to remove opinion from the copy.\n\nAccording to Robert McChesney, healthy journalism in a democratic country must provide an opinion of people in power and who wish to be in power, must include a range of opinions and must regard the informational needs of all people.\n\nMany debates centre on whether journalists are \"supposed\" to be \"objective\" and \"neutral\"; arguments include the fact that journalists produce news out of and as part of a particular social context, and that they are guided by professional codes of ethics and do their best to represent all legitimate points of view. Additionally, the ability to render a subject's complex and fluid narrative with sufficient accuracy is sometimes challenged by the time available to spend with subjects, the affordances or constraints of the medium used to tell the story, and the evolving nature of people's identities.\n\nThere are several forms of journalism with diverse audiences. Thus, journalism is said to serve the role of a \"fourth estate\", acting as a watchdog on the workings of the government. A single publication (such as a newspaper) contains many forms of journalism, each of which may be presented in different formats. Each section of a newspaper, magazine, or website may cater to a different audience.\nSome forms include:\n\nBULLET::::- Access journalism – journalists who self-censor and voluntarily cease speaking about issues that might embarrass their hosts, guests, or powerful politicians or businesspersons.\nBULLET::::- Advocacy journalism – writing to advocate particular viewpoints or influence the opinions of the audience.\nBULLET::::- Broadcast journalism – written or spoken journalism for radio or television.\nBULLET::::- Citizen journalism – participatory journalism.\nBULLET::::- Data journalism – the practice of finding stories in numbers, and using numbers to tell stories. Data journalists may use data to support their reporting. They may also report about uses and misuses of data. The US news organization ProPublica is known as a pioneer of data journalism.\nBULLET::::- Drone journalism – use of drones to capture journalistic footage.\nBULLET::::- Gonzo journalism – first championed by Hunter S. Thompson, gonzo journalism is a \"highly personal style of reporting\".\nBULLET::::- Interactive journalism – a type of online journalism that is presented on the web\nBULLET::::- Investigative journalism – in-depth reporting that uncovers social problems. Often leads to major social problems being resolved.\nBULLET::::- Photojournalism – the practice of telling true stories through images\nBULLET::::- Sensor journalism – the use of sensors to support journalistic inquiry.\nBULLET::::- Tabloid journalism – writing that is light-hearted and entertaining. Considered less legitimate than mainstream journalism.\nBULLET::::- Yellow journalism (or sensationalism) – writing which emphasizes exaggerated claims or rumors.\n\nThe rise of social media has drastically changed the nature of journalistic reporting, giving rise to so-called citizen journalists. In a 2014 study of journalists in the United States, 40% of participants claimed they rely on social media as a source, with over 20% depending on microblogs to collect facts. From this, the conclusion can be drawn that breaking news nowadays often stems from user-generated content, including videos and pictures posted online in social media. However, though 69.2% of the surveyed journalists agreed that social media allowed them to connect to their audience, only 30% thought it had a positive influence on news credibility.\n\nConsequently, this has resulted in arguments to reconsider journalism as a process distributed among many authors, including the socially mediating public, rather than as individual products and articles written by dedicated journalists.\n\nBecause of these changes, the credibility ratings of news outlets has reached an all-time low. A 2014 study revealed that only 22% of Americans reported a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot of confidence\" in either television news or newspapers.\n\n\"Fake news\" is also deliberately untruthful information which can often spread quickly on social media or by means of fake news websites. It is often published to intentionally mislead readers to ultimately benefit a cause, organization or an individual. A glaring example was the proliferation of fake news in social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Conspiracy theories, hoaxes, and lies have been circulated under the guise of news reports to benefit specific candidates. One example is a fabricated report of Hillary Clinton's email which was published by a non-existent newspaper called The Denver Guardian. Many critics blamed Facebook for the spread of such material. Its news feed algorithm, in particular, was identified by Vox as the platform where the social media giant exercise billions of editorial decisions every day. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, has acknowledged the company's role in this problem: in a testimony before a combined Senate Judiciary and Commerce committee hearing on April 20, 2018, he said:It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.Readers can often evaluate credibility of news by examining the credibility of the underlying news organization.\n\nThe phrase was popularized and inaccurately used by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign to discredit what he perceived as negative news coverage of his candidacy and then the presidency.\n\nThe definition of 'fake news' above, could also be applied to the general category of 'Propaganda' when it is applied to the field of political reporting. Because a large part of political journalism involves \"analysis\", and not simple reporting of what is said, or presented, writers and journalists have the opportunity to present specific kinds of analysis which can favor one ideological or political position over another; it can also be used to represent \"personalities\" in favorable/unfavorable ways. If the definition of propaganda includes misrepresentation of facts, and deliberate distortions of narrative, or applied \"emphasis\" not necessarily contained in the original, then Fake News falls squarely inside the parameters of Propaganda also. It could be argued that true \"objectivity\" is not really possible to produce when it comes to presenting an analysis of political activity, any individual observer and journalist is going to perceive what they experience through the lens of their own political bias, this, of course, is the case with entire organizations also.\n\nWhile publications reporting the news to the general public in a standardized fashion only began to appear in the 17th century and later, governments as early as Han dynasty China made use of regularly published news bulletins. Similar publications were established in the Republic of Venice in the 16th century. These bulletins, however, were intended only for government officials, and thus were not journalistic news publications in the modern sense of the term.\n\nAs mass-printing technologies like the printing press spread, newspapers were established to provide increasingly literate audiences with the news. The first references to privately-owned newspaper publishers in China date to the late Ming dynasty in 1582. Johann Carolus's \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", published in 1605 in Strassburg, is often recognized as the first newspaper in Europe. The first successful English daily, the \"Daily Courant\", was published from 1702 to 1735. While journalistic enterprises were started as private ventures in some regions, such as The Holy Roman Empire and the British Empire, other countries such as France and Prussia kept tighter control of the press, treating it primarily as an outlet for government propaganda and subjecting it to uniform censorship. Other governments, such as the Russian Empire, were even more distrusting of the journalistic press and effectively banned journalistic publications until the mid-19th century. As newspaper publication became a more and more established practice, publishers would increase publication to a weekly or daily rate. Newspapers were more heavily concentrated in cities that were centres of trade, such as Amsterdam, London, and Berlin. The first newspapers in Latin America would be established in the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nNewspapers played a significant role in mobilizing popular support in favor of the liberal revolutions of the late 18th and 19th centuries. In the American Colonies, newspapers motivated people to revolt against British rule by publishing grievances against the British crown and republishing pamphlets by revolutionaries such as Thomas Paine, while loyalist publications motivated support against the American Revolution. News publications in the United States would remain proudly and publicly partisan throughout the 19th century. In France, political newspapers sprang up during the French Revolution, with \"L'Ami du peuple\", edited by Jean-Paul Marat, playing a particularly famous role in arguing for the rights of the revolutionary lower classes. Napoleon would reintroduce strict censorship laws in 1800, but after his reign print publications would flourish and play an important role in political culture. As part of the Revolutions of 1848, radical liberal publications such as the \"Rheinische Zeitung, Pesti Hírlap,\" and \"Morgenbladet\" would motivate people toward deposing the aristocratic governments of Central Europe. Other liberal publications played a more moderate role: \"The Russian Bulletin\" praised Alexander II of Russia's liberal reforms in the late 19th century, and supported increased political and economic freedoms for peasants as well as the establishment of a parliamentary system in Russia. Farther to the left, socialist and communist newspapers had wide followings in France, Russia and Germany despite being outlawed by the government.\n\nJournalism in China before 1910 primarily served the international community. The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism. All the major cities launched such efforts. By the late 1920s, however, there was a much greater emphasis on advertising and expanding circulation, and much less interest in the sort of advocacy journalism that had inspired the revolutionaries.\n\nThe Parisian newspapers were largely stagnant after the war; circulation inched up to 6 million a day from 5 million in 1910. The major postwar success story was \"Paris Soir\"; which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation, and serious articles to build prestige. By 1939 its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid \"Le Petit Parisien.\" In addition to its daily paper \"Paris Soir\" sponsored a highly successful women's magazine \"Marie-Claire.\" Another magazine \"Match\" was modeled after the photojournalism of the American magazine \"Life.\"\n\nBy 1900 popular journalism in Britain aimed at the largest possible audience, including the working class, had proven a success and made its profits through advertising. Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe (1865–1922), \"More than anyone... shaped the modern press. Developments he introduced or harnessed remain central: broad contents, exploitation of advertising revenue to subsidize prices, aggressive marketing, subordinate regional markets, independence from party control. His \"Daily Mail\" held the world record for daily circulation until his death. Prime Minister Lord Salisbury quipped it was \"written by office boys for office boys\".\n\nThe first newspaper of India, Hicky's Bengal Gazette, was published on January 29, 1780. This first effort at journalism enjoyed only a short stint yet it was a momentous development, as it gave birth to modern journalism in India. Following Hicky's efforts which had to be shut down just within two years of circulation, several English newspapers started publication in the aftermath. Most of them enjoyed a circulation figure of about 400 and were weeklies giving personal news items and classified advertisements about a variety of products. Later on, in the 1800s, English newspapers were started by Indian publishers with English-speaking Indians as the target audience. During that era vast differences in language was a major problem in facilitating smooth communication among the people of the country. This is because they hardly knew the languages prevalent in other parts of this vast land. However, English came as the 'linguafranca' for everyone from across the country. Notable among this breed is the one named ‘Bengal Gazette’ started by Gangadhar Bhattacharyya in 1816.\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th century in the United States saw the advent of media empires controlled by the likes of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer. Realizing that they could expand their audience by abandoning politically polarized content, thus making more money off of advertising, American newspapers began to abandon their partisan politics in favor of less political reporting starting around 1900. Newspapers of this era embraced sensationalized reporting and larger headline typefaces and layouts, a style that would become dubbed \"yellow journalism\". Newspaper publishing became much more heavily professionalized in this era, and issues of writing quality and workroom discipline saw vast improvement. This era saw the establishment of freedom of the press as a legal norm, as President Theodore Roosevelt tried and failed to sue newspapers for reporting corruption in his handling of the purchase of the Panama Canal. Still, critics note that although government's ability to suppress journalistic speech is heavily limited, the concentration of newspaper (and general media) ownership in the hands of a small number of private business owners leads to other biases in reporting and media self-censorship that benefits the interests of corporations and the government.\n\nThe rampant discrimination and segregation against African-Americans led to the founding their own daily and weekly newspapers, especially in large cities. While the first Black newspapers in America were established in the early 19th century, in the 20th century these newspapers truly flourished in major cities, with publishers playing a major role in politics and business affairs. Representative leaders included Robert Sengstacke Abbott (1870–1940), publisher of the Chicago Defender; John Mitchell, Jr. (1863–1929), editor of the \"Richmond Planet\" and president of the National Afro-American Press Association; Anthony Overton (1865–1946), publisher of the Chicago Bee, and Robert Lee Vann (1879–1940), the publisher and editor of the Pittsburgh Courier.\n\nIn the 1920s in the United States, as newspapers dropped their blatant partisanship in search of new subscribers, political analyst Walter Lippmann and philosopher John Dewey debated the role of journalism in a democracy. Their differing philosophies still characterize an ongoing debate about the role of journalism in society. Lippmann's views prevailed for decades, helping to bolster the Progressives' confidence in decision-making by experts, with the general public standing by. Lippmann argued that high-powered journalism was wasted on ordinary citizens, but was of genuine value to an elite class of administrators and experts. Dewey, on the other hand, believed not only that the public was capable of understanding the issues created or responded to by the elite, but also that it was in the public forum that decisions should be made after discussion and debate. When issues were thoroughly vetted, then the best ideas would bubble to the surface. The danger of demagoguery and false news did not trouble Dewey. His faith in popular democracy has been implemented in various degrees, and is now known as \"community journalism\". The 1920s debate has been endlessly repeated across the globe, as journalists wrestle with their roles.\n\nRadio broadcasting increased in popularity starting in the 1920s, becoming widespread in the 1930s. While most radio programming was oriented toward music, sports, and entertainment, radio also broadcast speeches and occasional news programming. Radio reached the peak of its importance during World War II, as radio and newsreels were the two main sources of up-to-date information on the ongoing war. In the Soviet Union, radio would be heavily utilized by the state to broadcast political speeches by leadership. These broadcasts would very rarely have any additional editorial content or analysis, setting them apart from modern news reporting. The radio would however soon be eclipsed by broadcast television starting in the 1950s.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, United States broadcast television channels would air 10-to-15-minute segments of news programming one or two times per evening. The era of live-TV news coverage would begin in the 1960s with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, broadcast and reported to live on a variety of nationally syndicated television channels. During the 60s and 70s, television channels would begin adding regular morning or midday news shows. Starting in 1980 with the establishment of CNN, news channels began providing 24-hour news coverage, a format which persists through today.\n\nThe role and status of journalism, as well as mass media, has undergone changes over the last two decades, together with the advancement of digital technology and publication of news on the Internet. This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other electronic devices. News organizations are challenged to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish in print. Newspapers have seen print revenues sink at a faster pace than the rate of growth for digital revenues.\n\nNotably, in the American media landscape, newsrooms have reduced their staff and coverage as traditional media channels, such as television, grappling with declining audiences. For example, between 2007 and 2012, CNN edited its story packages into nearly half of their original time length.\n\nThe compactness in coverage has been linked to broad audience attrition. According to the Pew Research Center, the circulation for U.S. newspapers has fallen sharply in the 21st century. The digital era also introduced journalism that ordinary citizens play a greater role in the process, with the rise of citizen journalism being possible through the Internet. Using video camera-equipped smartphones, active citizens are now enabled to record footage of news events and upload them onto channels like YouTube (which is often discovered and used by mainstream news media outlets). News from a variety of online sources, like blogs and other social media, results in a wider choice of official and unofficial sources, rather than only traditional media organizations.\n\nWhile various existing codes have some differences, most share common elements including the principles of – truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, impartiality, fairness and public accountability – as these apply to the acquisition of newsworthy information and its subsequent dissemination to the public.\n\nBill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel propose several guidelines for journalists in their book \"The Elements of Journalism\".\nTheir view is that journalism's first loyalty is to the citizenry and that journalists are thus obliged to tell the truth and must serve as an independent monitor of powerful individuals and institutions within society. In this view, the essence of journalism is to provide citizens with reliable information through the discipline of verification.\n\nSome journalistic Codes of Ethics, notably the European ones, also include a concern with discriminatory references in news based on race, religion, sexual orientation, and physical or mental disabilities. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe approved in 1993 Resolution 1003 on the Ethics of Journalism which recommends journalists to respect the presumption of innocence, in particular in cases that are still \"sub judice\".\n\nIn the UK, all newspapers are bound by the Code of Practice of the Independent Press Standards Organisation. This includes points like respecting people's privacy and ensuring accuracy. However, the Media Standards Trust has criticized the PCC, claiming it needs to be radically changed to secure the public trust of newspapers.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the media climate prior to the 20th century, where the media market was dominated by smaller newspapers and pamphleteers who usually had an overt and often radical agenda, with no presumption of balance or objectivity.\n\nBecause of the pressure on journalists to report news promptly and before their competitors, factual errors occur more frequently than in writing produced and edited under less time pressure. Thus a typical issue of a major daily newspaper may contain several corrections of articles published the previous day. Perhaps the most famous journalistic mistake caused by time pressure was the Dewey Defeats Truman edition of the Chicago Daily Tribune, based on early election returns that failed to anticipate the actual result of the 1948 US presidential election.\n\nSuch a code of conduct can, in the real world, be difficult to uphold consistently. Reporting and editing do not occur in a vacuum but always reflect the political context in which journalists, no less than other citizens, operate.\n\nA news organization's budget inevitably reflects decision-making about what news to cover, for what audience, and in what depth. When budgets are cut, editors may sacrifice reporters in distant news bureaus, reduce the number of staff assigned to low-income areas, or wipe entire communities from the publication's zone of interest.\n\nPublishers, owners and other corporate executives, especially advertising sales executives, could try to use their powers over journalists to influence how news is reported and published. For this reason, journalists traditionally relied on top management to create and maintain a \"firewall\" between the news and other departments in a news organization to prevent undue influence on the news department.\n\nThere are over 242 codes of ethics in journalism that vary across various regions of the world. The codes of ethics are created through an interaction of different groups of people such as the public and journalists themselves. Most of the codes of ethics serve as a representation of the economic and political beliefs of the society where the code was written. Despite the fact that there are a variety of codes of ethics, some of the core elements present in all codes are: remaining objective, providing the truth, and being honest.\n\nJournalism does not have a universal code of conduct; individuals are not legally obliged to follow a certain set of rules like a doctor or a lawyer does. There have been discussions for creating a universal code of conduct in journalism. One suggestion centers on having three claims for credibility, justifiable consequence, and the claim of humanity. Within the claim of credibility, journalists are expected to provide the public with reliable and trustworthy information, and allowing the public to question the nature of the information and its acquisition. The second claim of justifiable consequences centers on weighing the benefits and detriments of a potentially harmful story and acting accordingly. An example of justifiable consequence is exposing a professional with dubious practices; on the other hand, acting within justifiable consequence means writing compassionately about a family in mourning. The third claim is the claim of humanity which states that journalists are writing for a global population and therefore must serve everyone globally in their work, avoiding smaller loyalties to country, city, etc.\n\nGovernments have widely varying policies and practices towards journalists, which control what they can research and write, and what press organizations can publish. Some governments guarantee the freedom of the press; while other nations severely restrict what journalists can research or publish.\n\nJournalists in many nations have some privileges that members of the general public do not, including better access to public events, crime scenes and press conferences, and to extended interviews with public officials, celebrities and others in the public eye.\n\nJournalists who elect to cover conflicts, whether wars between nations or insurgencies within nations, often give up any expectation of protection by government, if not giving up their rights to protection from the government. Journalists who are captured or detained during a conflict are expected to be treated as civilians and to be released to their national government. Many governments around the world target journalists for intimidation, harassment, and violence because of the nature of their work.\n\nJournalists' interaction with sources sometimes involves confidentiality, an extension of freedom of the press giving journalists a legal protection to keep the identity of a confidential informant private even when demanded by police or prosecutors; withholding their sources can land journalists in contempt of court, or in jail.\n\nIn the United States, there is no right to protect sources in a federal court. However, federal courts will refuse to force journalists to reveal their sources, unless the information the court seeks is highly relevant to the case and there's no other way to get it. State courts provide varying degrees of such protection. Journalists who refuse to testify even when ordered to can be found in contempt of court and fined or jailed. On the journalistic side of keeping sources confidential, there is also a risk to the journalist's credibility because there can be no actual confirmation of whether the information is valid. As such it is highly discouraged for journalists to have confidential sources.\n\nBULLET::::- Citizen Journalism\nBULLET::::- Fourth Estate\nBULLET::::- Hallin's spheres\nBULLET::::- History of American newspapers\nBULLET::::- History of journalism\nBULLET::::- Journalism education and Journalism school\nBULLET::::- Journalism ethics and standards\nBULLET::::- Journalism genres\nBULLET::::- Lists of journalists\nBULLET::::- List of American journalism awards\nBULLET::::- Non-profit journalism\nBULLET::::- Objectivity (journalism)\nBULLET::::- Sensor journalism\nBULLET::::- Sports journalism\nBULLET::::- \"American Journalism Review\"\nBULLET::::- \"Columbia Journalism Review\"\nBULLET::::- \"Health News Review\"\nBULLET::::- \"Ryerson Review of Journalism\"\n\nBULLET::::- \"Journalism Practice\"\nBULLET::::- \"Journalism Studies\"\nBULLET::::- \"Journalism (journal)\"\n\nBULLET::::- Kaltenbrunner, Andy and Matthias Karmasin and Daniela Kraus, eds. \"The Journalism Report V: Innovation and Transition\", Facultas, 2017\nBULLET::::- Quick, Amanda C. ed. \"World Press Encyclopedia: A Survey of Press Systems Worldwide\" (2nd ed. 2 vol 2002); 2500 pp; highly detailed coverage of every country large and small.\nBULLET::::- de Beer Arnold S. and John C.
