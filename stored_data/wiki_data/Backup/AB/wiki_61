{"id": "15823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15823", "title": "Joseph Conrad", "text": "Joseph Conrad\n\nJoseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, ; 3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. Conrad wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe. \nConrad is considered an early modernist, though his works contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced numerous authors, and many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that Conrad's fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.\n\nWriting near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew, among other things, on his native Poland's national experiences and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and that profoundly explore the human psyche.\n\nConrad was born on 3 December 1857 in Berdychiv (), Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire; the region had once been part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. He was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowski—a writer, translator, political activist, and would-be revolutionary—and his wife Ewa Bobrowska. He was christened \"Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski\" after his maternal grandfather Józef, his paternal grandfather Teodor, and the heroes (both named \"Konrad\") of two poems by Adam Mickiewicz, \"Dziady\" and \"Konrad Wallenrod\", and was known to his family as \"Konrad\", rather than \"Józef\".\n\nThough the vast majority of the surrounding area's inhabitants were Ukrainians, and the great majority of Berdychiv's residents were Jewish, almost all the countryside was owned by the Polish \"szlachta\" (nobility), to which Conrad's family belonged as bearers of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms. Polish literature, particularly patriotic literature, was held in high esteem by the area's Polish population.\n\nThe Korzeniowski family had played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence. Conrad's paternal grandfather Teodor had served under Prince Józef Poniatowski during Napoleon's Russian campaign and had formed his own cavalry squadron during the November 1830 Uprising. Conrad's fiercely patriotic father Apollo belonged to the \"Red\" political faction, whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland, but which also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom. Conrad's subsequent refusal to follow in Apollo's footsteps, and his choice of exile over resistance, were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad.\n\nBecause of the father's attempts at farming and his political activism, the family moved repeatedly. In May 1861 they moved to Warsaw, where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire. This led to his imprisonment in Pavilion X of the Warsaw Citadel. Conrad would write: \"[I]n the courtyard of this Citadel—characteristically for our nation—my childhood memories begin.\" On 9 May 1862 Apollo and his family were exiled to Vologda, north of Moscow and known for its bad climate. In January 1863 Apollo's sentence was commuted, and the family was sent to Chernihiv in northeast Ukraine, where conditions were much better. However, on 18 April 1865 Ewa died of tuberculosis.\n\nApollo did his best to home-school Conrad. The boy's early reading introduced him to the two elements that later dominated his life: in Victor Hugo's \"Toilers of the Sea\" he encountered the sphere of activity to which he would devote his youth; Shakespeare brought him into the orbit of English literature. Most of all, though, he read Polish Romantic poetry. Half a century later he explained that \"The Polishness in my works comes from Mickiewicz and Słowacki. My father read [Mickiewicz's] \"Pan Tadeusz\" aloud to me and made me read it aloud... I used to prefer [Mickiewicz's] \"Konrad Wallenrod\" [and] \"Grażyna\". Later I preferred Słowacki. You know why Słowacki?... [He is the soul of all Poland]\".\n\nIn December 1867, Apollo took his son to the Austrian-held part of Poland, which for two years had been enjoying considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After sojourns in Lwów and several smaller localities, on 20 February 1869 they moved to Kraków (until 1596 the capital of Poland), likewise in Austrian Poland. A few months later, on 23 May 1869, Apollo Korzeniowski died, leaving Conrad orphaned at the age of eleven. Like Conrad's mother, Apollo had been gravely ill with tuberculosis.\n\nThe young Conrad was placed in the care of Ewa's brother, Tadeusz Bobrowski. Conrad's poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlay. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring, he excelled only in geography. Since the boy's illness was clearly of nervous origin, the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle saw him as a sailor-cum-businessman who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities. In fact, in the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) Leopold McClintock's book about his 1857–59 expeditions in the \"Fox\", in search of Sir John Franklin's lost ships ' and '. He also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat. A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes.\n\nIn August 1873 Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to Lwów to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the 1863 Uprising; group conversation there was in French. The owner's daughter recalled:\nConrad had been at the establishment for just over a year when in September 1874, for uncertain reasons, his uncle removed him from school in Lwów and took him back to Kraków.\n\nOn 13 October 1874 Bobrowski sent the sixteen-year-old to Marseilles, France, for a planned career at sea. Though Conrad had not completed secondary school, his accomplishments included fluency in French (with a correct accent), some knowledge of Latin, German and Greek, probably a good knowledge of history, some geography, and probably already an interest in physics. He was well read, particularly in Polish Romantic literature. He belonged to the second generation in his family that had had to earn a living outside the family estates, having been born and reared partly in the milieu of the working intelligentsia, a social class that was starting to play an important role in Central and Eastern Europe. He had absorbed enough of the history, culture and literature of his native land to be able eventually to develop a distinctive world view and make unique contributions to the literature of his adoptive Britain. It was tensions that originated in his childhood in Poland and grew in his adulthood abroad that would give rise to Conrad's greatest literary achievements. Zdzisław Najder, himself an emigrant from Poland, observes:\nIt has been suggested that when Conrad left Poland, he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past. In refutation of this, Najder quotes from Conrad's 14 August 1883 letter to family friend Stefan Buszczyński, written nine years after Conrad had left Poland:\n\nConrad was a Russian subject, having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In December 1867, with the Russian government's permission, his father Apollo had taken him to the Austrian part of the former Commonwealth, which enjoyed considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After the father's death, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him—to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to Ukraine, in the Russian Empire—he would have been liable to many years' military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment.\n\nIn a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad's uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects: the desirability of Conrad's naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad's plans to join the British merchant marine. \"[D]o you speak English?... I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service... I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland...\" In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad's idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of \"one of the more important Southern [American] Republics\".\n\nEventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet, in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria, Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve the latter, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassy's home at Belgrave Square in his novel \"The Secret Agent\". Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released \"the son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine\" from the status of Russian subject.\n\nIn 1874 Conrad left Poland for Marseille, France, to start a merchant-marine career on French merchant ships. A trace of these years can be found in the northern Corsica town of Luri, where there is a plaque to a Corsican merchant seaman, Dominique Cervoni, whom Conrad befriended. Cervoni became the inspiration for some of Conrad's characters, such as the title character of the 1904 novel \"Nostromo\". Conrad visited Corsica with his wife in 1921, partly in search of connections with his long-dead friend and fellow merchant seaman.\n\nAfter nearly four years in France and on French ships, Conrad joined the British merchant marine and for the next fifteen years served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, able-bodied seaman) and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain's rank. During the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left Kraków in October 1874 until he signed off the \"Adowa\" in January 1894, he had worked in ships, including long periods in ports, for 10 years and almost 8 months. He had spent just over 8 years at sea—9 months of this as a passenger.\n\nMost of Conrad's stories and novels, and many of their characters, were drawn from his seafaring career and persons whom he had met or heard about. For his fictional characters he often borrowed the authentic names of actual persons. The historic trader William Charles Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on four short visits to Berau in Borneo, appears as \"Almayer\" (possibly a simple misspelling) in Conrad's first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\". Other authentic names include those of Captain McWhirr (in \"Typhoon\"), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (\"Youth\"), Captain Lingard (\"Almayer's Folly\" and elsewhere), and Captain Ellis (\"The Shadow Line\"). Conrad also preserves, in \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\", the authentic name of the \"Narcissus\", a ship in which he sailed in 1884.\n\nDuring a brief call in India in 1885–86, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion, a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885 just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship \"Tilkhurst\". These letters are Conrad's first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology. More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83. He had departed from \"hope for the future\" and from the conceit of \"sailing [ever] toward Poland\", and from his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.\n\nConrad's three-year association with a Belgian trading company included service as captain of a steamer on the Congo River, an episode that would inspire his novella, \"Heart of Darkness\". During this period, in 1890 in the Congo, Conrad encountered and befriended the Irish Republican and advocate for human rights, Sir Roger Casement.\n\nWhen Conrad left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the clipper ship \"Torrens\", one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques, a consumptive Cambridge graduate who died less than a year later (19 September 1893) and was, according to Conrad's \"A Personal Record\", the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of his \"Almayer's Folly\". Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel.\n\nConrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the \"Torrens\" docked at London and \"J. Conrad Korzemowin\" (per the certificate of discharge) debarked. When the \"Torrens\" had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys' preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship; he would remain in touch with both. The protagonist of one of Galsworthy's first literary attempts, \"The Doldrums\" (1895–96), the first mate Armand, is obviously modelled on Conrad. At Cape Town, where the \"Torrens\" remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad.\n\nIn 1894, aged 36, Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea, partly because of poor health, partly due to unavailability of ships, and partly because he had become so fascinated with writing that he had decided on a literary career. His first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\", set on the east coast of Borneo, was published in 1895. Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name \"Joseph Conrad\"; \"Konrad\" was, of course, the third of his Polish given names, but his use of it—in the anglicised version, \"Conrad\"—may also have been an homage to the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz's patriotic narrative poem, \"Konrad Wallenrod\".\n\nEdward Garnett, a young publisher's reader and literary critic who would play one of the chief supporting roles in Conrad's literary career, had—like Unwin's first reader of \"Almayer's Folly\", Wilfrid Hugh Chesson—been impressed by the manuscript, but Garnett had been \"uncertain whether the English was good enough for publication.\" Garnett had shown the novel to his wife, Constance Garnett, later a translator of Russian literature. She had thought Conrad's foreignness a positive merit.\n\nWhile Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia, the region looms large in his early work. According to Najder, Conrad, the exile and wanderer, was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once: the lack of a common cultural background with his Anglophone readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the English-speaking world. At the same time, the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty: \"Almayer's Folly\", and later \"An Outpost of Progress\" (1897, set in a Congo exploited by King Leopold II of Belgium) and \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899, likewise set in the Congo), contain bitter reflections on colonialism. The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the area's British dependencies, which he never visited. He \"was apparently intrigued by... struggles aimed at preserving national independence. The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works.\" \n\n\"Almayer's Folly\", together with its successor, \"An Outcast of the Islands\" (1896), laid the foundation for Conrad's reputation as a romantic teller of exotic tales—a misunderstanding of his purpose that was to frustrate him for the rest of his career.\n\nAlmost all of Conrad's writings were first published in newspapers and magazines: influential reviews like \"The Fortnightly Review\" and the \"North American Review\"; avant-garde publications like the \"Savoy\", \"New Review\", and \"The English Review\"; popular short-fiction magazines like \"The Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Harper's Magazine\"; women's journals like the \"Pictorial Review\" and \"Romance\"; mass-circulation dailies like the \"Daily Mail\" and the \"New York Herald\"; and illustrated newspapers like \"The Illustrated London News\" and the \"Illustrated Buffalo Express\". He also wrote for \"The Outlook\", an imperialist weekly magazine, between 1898 and 1906.\n\nFinancial success long eluded Conrad, who often requested advances from magazine and book publishers, and loans from acquaintances such as John Galsworthy. Eventually a government grant (\"Civil List pension\") of £100 per annum, awarded on 9 August 1910, somewhat relieved his financial worries, and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by English intellectuals, popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of \"Chance\", which is often considered one of his weaker novels.\n\nEdward Said describes three phases to Conrad's literary career. In the first and longest, from the 1890s to World War I, Conrad wrote most of his great works, including \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\" (1897), \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899), \"Lord Jim\" (1900), \"Nostromo\" (1904), \"The Secret Agent\" (1907) and \"Under Western Eyes\" (1911). The second phase, spanning the war and following the popular success of \"Chance\" (1913), is marked by the advent of Conrad's public persona as \"great writer\". In the third and final phase, from the end of World War I to Conrad's death (1924), he at last finds an uneasy peace; it is, as C. McCarthy writes, as though \"the War has allowed Conrad's psyche to purge itself of terror and anxiety.\"\n\nConrad was a reserved man, wary of showing emotion. He scorned sentimentality; his manner of portraying emotion in his books was full of restraint, scepticism and irony. In the words of his uncle Bobrowski, as a young man Conrad was \"extremely sensitive, conceited, reserved, and in addition excitable. In short [...] all the defects of the \"Nałęcz\" family.\"\n\nConrad suffered throughout life from ill health, physical and mental. A newspaper review of a Conrad biography suggested that the book could have been subtitled \"Thirty Years of Debt, Gout, Depression and Angst\". In 1891 he was hospitalised for several months, suffering from gout, neuralgic pains in his right arm and recurrent attacks of malaria. He also complained of swollen hands \"which made writing difficult\". Taking his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski's advice, he convalesced at a spa in Switzerland. Conrad had a phobia of dentistry, neglecting his teeth until they had to be extracted. In one letter he remarked that every novel he had written had cost him a tooth. Conrad's physical afflictions were, if anything, less vexatious than his mental ones. In his letters he often described symptoms of depression; \"the evidence\", writes Najder, \"is so strong that it is nearly impossible to doubt it.\"\n\nIn March 1878, at the end of his Marseilles period, 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide, by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver. According to his uncle, who was summoned by a friend, Conrad had fallen into debt. Bobrowski described his subsequent \"study\" of his nephew in an extensive letter to , his own ideological opponent and a friend of Conrad's late father Apollo. To what extent the suicide attempt had been made in earnest, likely will never be known, but it is suggestive of a situational depression.\n\nLittle is known about any intimate relationships that Conrad might have had prior to his marriage, confirming a popular image of the author as an isolated bachelor who preferred the company of close male friends. However, in 1888 during a stop-over on Mauritius, Conrad developed a couple of romantic interests. One of these would be described in his 1910 story \"A Smile of Fortune\", which contains autobiographical elements (e.g., one of the characters is the same Chief Mate Burns who appears in \"The Shadow Line\"). The narrator, a young captain, flirts ambiguously and surreptitiously with Alice Jacobus, daughter of a local merchant living in a house surrounded by a magnificent rose garden. Research has confirmed that in Port Louis at the time there was a 17-year-old Alice Shaw, whose father, a shipping agent, owned the only rose garden in town.\n\nMore is known about Conrad's other, more open flirtation. An old friend, Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine, introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law. Renouf's eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt, a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers. Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain, many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists, and Conrad's excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him. He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts', where he often met the Misses Renouf. A couple of days before leaving Port Louis, Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie. She was already, however, engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin. After the rebuff, Conrad did not pay a farewell visit but sent a polite letter to Gabriel Renouf, saying he would never return to Mauritius and adding that on the day of the wedding his thoughts would be with them.\n\nIn March 1896 Conrad married an Englishwoman, Jessie George. The couple had two sons, Borys and John. The elder, Borys, proved a disappointment in scholarship and integrity. Jessie was an unsophisticated, working-class girl, sixteen years younger than Conrad. To his friends, she was an inexplicable choice of wife, and the subject of some rather disparaging and unkind remarks. (See Lady Ottoline Morrell's opinion of Jessie in Impressions.) However, according to other biographers such as Frederick Karl, Jessie provided what Conrad needed, namely a \"straightforward, devoted, quite competent\" companion. Similarly, Jones remarks that, despite whatever difficulties the marriage endured, \"there can be no doubt that the relationship sustained Conrad's career as a writer\", which might have been much less successful without her.\n\nThe couple rented a long series of successive homes, occasionally in France, sometimes briefly in London, but mostly in the English countryside, sometimes from friends—to be close to friends, to enjoy the peace of the countryside, but above all because it was more affordable. Except for several vacations in France and Italy, a 1914 vacation in his native Poland, and a 1923 visit to the United States, Conrad lived the rest of his life in England.\n\nThe 1914 vacation with his wife and sons in Poland, at the urging of Józef Retinger, coincided with the outbreak of World War I. On 28 July 1914, the day war broke out between Austro-Hungary and Serbia, Conrad and the Retingers arrived in Kraków (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), where Conrad visited childhood haunts. As the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border, there was a risk of being stranded in a battle zone. With wife Jessie and younger son John ill, Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane. They left Kraków on 2 August. A few days after arrival in Zakopane, they moved to the Konstantynówka \"pension\" operated by Conrad's cousin Aniela Zagórska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman Józef Piłsudski and Conrad's acquaintance, the young concert pianist Artur Rubinstein.\n\nZagórska introduced Conrad to Polish writers, intellectuals and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane, including novelist Stefan Żeromski and Tadeusz Nalepiński, a writer friend of anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski. Conrad aroused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad. He charmed new acquaintances, especially women. However, Marie Curie's physician sister, Bronisława Dłuska, scolded him for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land.\n\nBut thirty-two-year-old Aniela Zagórska (daughter of the \"pension\" keeper), Conrad's niece who would translate his works into Polish in 1923–39, idolised him, kept him company, and provided him with books. He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older, recently deceased Bolesław Prus, read everything by his fellow victim of Poland's 1863 Uprising—\"my beloved Prus\"—that he could get his hands on, and pronounced him \"better than Dickens\"—a favourite English novelist of Conrad's.\n\nConrad, who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to still be fluent in his native tongue, participated in their impassioned political discussions. He declared presciently, as Piłsudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris, that in the war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the Central Powers must in turn be beaten by France and Britain.\n\nAfter many travails and vicissitudes, at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England. On his return, he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Poland's sovereignty.\n\nJessie Conrad would later write in her memoirs: \"I understood my husband so much better after those months in Poland. So many characteristics that had been strange and unfathomable to me before, took, as it were, their right proportions. I understood that his temperament was that of his countrymen.\"\n\nThe most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay, \"Autocracy and War\", whose starting point was the Russo-Japanese War (he finished the article a month before the Battle of Tsushima Strait). The essay begins with a statement about Russia's incurable weakness and ends with warnings against Prussia, the dangerous aggressor in a future European war. For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future, but Russia's lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect. Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship. He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness. In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past.\n\nConrad's distrust of democracy sprang from his doubts whether the propagation of democracy as an aim in itself could solve any problems. He thought that, in view of the weakness of human nature and of the \"criminal\" character of society, democracy offered boundless opportunities for demagogues and charlatans. Conrad kept his distance from partisan politics, and never voted in British national elections.\n\nHe accused social democrats of his time of acting to weaken \"the national sentiment, the preservation of which [was his] concern\"—of attempting to dissolve national identities in an impersonal melting-pot. \"I look at the future from the depth of a very black past and I find that nothing is left for me except fidelity to a cause lost, to an idea without future.\" It was Conrad's hopeless fidelity to the memory of Poland that prevented him from believing in the idea of \"international fraternity\", which he considered, under the circumstances, just a verbal exercise. He resented some socialists' talk of freedom and world brotherhood while keeping silent about his own partitioned and oppressed Poland.\n\nBefore that, in the early 1880s, letters to Conrad from his uncle Tadeusz show Conrad apparently having hoped for an improvement in Poland's situation not through a liberation movement but by establishing an alliance with neighbouring Slavic nations. This had been accompanied by a faith in the Panslavic ideology—\"surprising\", Najder writes, \"in a man who was later to emphasize his hostility towards Russia, a conviction that... Poland's [superior] civilization and... historic... traditions would [let] her play a leading role... in the Panslavic community, [and his] doubts about Poland's chances of becoming a fully sovereign nation-state.\"\n\nConrad's alienation from \"partisan\" politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking man's burden imposed by his personality, as described in an 1894 letter of Conrad's to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author, Marguerite Poradowska (\"née\" Gachet, and cousin of Vincent van Gogh's physician, Paul Gachet) of Brussels:\n\nIn a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell, in response to the latter's book, \"The Problem of China\", which advocated socialist reforms and an oligarchy of sages who would reshape Chinese society, Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas:\n\nLeo Robson writes:\n\nBut, writes Robson, Conrad is no moral nihilist:\n\nIn an August 1901 letter to the editor of \"The New York Times Saturday Book Review\", Conrad wrote: \"Egoism, which is the moving force of the world, and altruism, which is its morality, these two contradictory instincts, of which one is so plain and the other so mysterious, cannot serve us unless in the incomprehensible alliance of their irreconcilable antagonism.\" \n\nOn 3 August 1924, Conrad died at his house, Oswalds, in Bishopsbourne, Kent, England, probably of a heart attack. He was interred at Canterbury Cemetery, Canterbury, under a misspelled version of his original Polish name, as \"Joseph Teador Conrad Korzeniowski\". Inscribed on his gravestone are the lines from Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" which he had chosen as the epigraph to his last complete novel, \"The Rover\":\n\nConrad's modest funeral took place amid great crowds. His old friend Edward Garnett recalled bitterly:\n\nAnother old friend of Conrad's, Cunninghame Graham, wrote Garnett: \"Aubry was saying to me... that had Anatole France died, all Paris would have been at his funeral.\"\n\nTwelve years later, Conrad's wife Jessie died on 6 December 1936 and was interred with him.\n\nIn 1996 his grave was designated a Grade II listed structure.\n\nDespite the opinions even of some who knew Conrad personally, such as fellow-novelist Henry James, Conrad—even when only writing elegantly crafted letters to his uncle and acquaintances—was always at heart a writer who sailed, rather than a sailor who wrote. He used his sailing experiences as a backdrop for many of his works, but he also produced works of similar world view, without the nautical motifs. The failure of many critics to appreciate this caused him much frustration.\n\nHe wrote oftener about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because—unlike, for example, his friend John Galsworthy, author of \"The Forsyte Saga\"—he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain. When Conrad's \"The Mirror of the Sea\" was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote to his French translator: \"The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me... Behind the concert of flattery, I can hear something like a whisper: 'Keep to the open sea! Don't land!' They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean.\" Writing to his friend Richard Curle, Conrad remarked that \"the public mind fastens on externals\" such as his \"sea life\", oblivious to how authors transform their material \"from particular to general, and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience\".\n\nNevertheless, Conrad found much sympathetic readership, especially in the United States. H.L. Mencken was one of the earliest and most influential American readers to recognise how Conrad conjured up \"the general out of the particular\". F. Scott Fitzgerald, writing to Mencken, complained about having been omitted from a list of Conrad imitators. Since Fitzgerald, dozens of other American writers have acknowledged their debts to Conrad, including William Faulkner, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, and Thomas Pynchon.\n\nAn October 1923 visitor to Oswalds, Conrad's home at the time—Cyril Clemens, a cousin of Mark Twain—quoted Conrad as saying: \"In everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture the reader's attention.\"\n\nConrad the artist famously aspired, in the words of his preface to \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\" (1897), \"by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel... before all, to make you \"see\". That—and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, consolation, fear, charm—all you demand—and, perhaps, also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.\"\n\nWriting in what to the visual arts was the age of Impressionism, and what to music was the age of impressionist music, Conrad showed himself in many of his works a prose poet of the highest order: for instance, in the evocative \"Patna\" and courtroom scenes of \"Lord Jim\"; in the scenes of the \"melancholy-mad elephant\" and the \"French gunboat firing into a continent\", in \"Heart of Darkness\"; in the doubled protagonists of \"The Secret Sharer\"; and in the verbal and conceptual resonances of \"Nostromo\" and \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\".\n\nConrad used his own memories as literary material so often that readers are tempted to treat his life and work as a single whole. His \"view of the world\", or elements of it, is often described by citing at once both his private and public statements, passages from his letters, and citations from his books. Najder warns that this approach produces an incoherent and misleading picture. \"An... uncritical linking of the two spheres, literature and private life, distorts each. Conrad used his own experiences as raw material, but the finished product should not be confused with the experiences themselves.\"\n\nMany of Conrad's characters were inspired by actual persons he met, including, in his first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\" (completed 1894), William Charles Olmeijer, the spelling of whose surname Conrad probably altered to \"Almayer\" inadvertently. The historic trader Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on his four short visits to Berau in Borneo, subsequently haunted Conrad's imagination. Conrad often borrowed the authentic names of actual individuals, e.g., Captain McWhirr (\"Typhoon\"), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (\"Youth\"), Captain Lingard (\"Almayer's Folly\" and elsewhere), Captain Ellis (\"The Shadow Line\"). \"Conrad\", writes J. I. M. Stewart, \"appears to have attached some mysterious significance to such links with actuality.\" Equally curious is \"a great deal of namelessness in Conrad, requiring some minor virtuosity to maintain.\" Thus we never learn the surname of the protagonist of \"Lord Jim\". Conrad also preserves, in \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\", the authentic name of the ship, the \"Narcissus\", in which he sailed in 1884.\n\nApart from Conrad's own experiences, a number of episodes in his fiction were suggested by past or contemporary publicly known events or literary works. The first half of the 1900 novel \"Lord Jim\" (the \"Patna\" episode) was inspired by the real-life 1880 story of the ; the second part, to some extent by the life of James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The 1901 short story \"Amy Foster\" was inspired partly by an anecdote in Ford Madox Ford's \"The Cinque Ports\" (1900), wherein a shipwrecked sailor from a German merchant ship, unable to communicate in English, and driven away by the local country people, finally found shelter in a pigsty. \n\nIn \"Nostromo\" (completed 1904), the theft of a massive consignment of silver was suggested to Conrad by a story he had heard in the Gulf of Mexico and later read about in a \"volume picked up outside a second-hand bookshop.\" The novel's political strand, according to Maya Jasanoff, is related to the creation of the Panama Canal. \"In January 1903\", she writes, \"just as Conrad started writing \"Nostromo\", the US and Colombian secretaries of state signed a treaty granting the United States a one-hundred-year renewable lease on a six-mile strip flanking the canal... While the [news]papers murmured about revolution in Colombia, Conrad opened a fresh section of \"Nostromo\" with hints of dissent in Costaguana\", his fictional South American country. He plotted a revolution in the Costaguanan fictional port of Sulaco that mirrored the real-life secessionist movement brewing in Panama. When Conrad finished the novel on 1 September 1904, writes Jasanoff, \"he left Sulaco in the condition of Panama. As Panama had gotten its independence instantly recognized by the United States and its economy bolstered by American investment in the canal, so Sulaco had \"its\" independence instantly recognized by the United States, and its economy underwritten by investment in the [fictional] San Tomé [silver] mine.\"\n\n\"The Secret Agent\" (completed 1906) was inspired by the French anarchist Martial Bourdin's 1894 death while apparently attempting to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Conrad's story \"The Secret Sharer\" (completed 1909) was inspired by an 1880 incident when Sydney Smith, first mate of the \"Cutty Sark\", had killed a seaman and fled from justice, aided by the ship's captain. The plot of \"Under Western Eyes\" (completed 1910) is kicked off by the assassination of a brutal Russian government minister, modelled after the real-life 1904 assassination of Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve. The near-novella \"Freya of the Seven Isles\" (completed in March 1911) was inspired by a story told to Conrad by a Malaya old hand and fan of Conrad's, Captain Carlos M. Marris.\n\nFor the natural surroundings of the high seas, the Malay Archipelago and South America, which Conrad described so vividly, he could rely on his own observations. What his brief landfalls could not provide was a thorough understanding of exotic cultures. For this he resorted, like other writers, to literary sources. When writing his Malayan stories, he consulted Alfred Russel Wallace's \"The Malay Archipelago\" (1869), James Brooke's journals, and books with titles like \"Perak and the Malays\", \"My Journal in Malayan Waters\", and \"Life in the Forests of the Far East\". When he set about writing his novel \"Nostromo\", set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, he turned to \"The War between Peru and Chile\"; Edward Eastwick, \"Venezuela: or, Sketches of Life in a South American Republic\" (1868); and George Frederick Masterman, \"Seven Eventful Years in Paraguay\" (1869). As a result of relying on literary sources, in \"Lord Jim\", as J. I. M. Stewart writes, Conrad's \"need to work to some extent from second-hand\" led to \"a certain thinness in Jim's relations with the... peoples... of Patusan...\" This prompted Conrad at some points to alter the nature of Charles Marlow's narrative to \"distanc[e] an uncertain command of the detail of Tuan Jim's empire.\"\n\nIn keeping with his scepticism and melancholy, Conrad almost invariably gives lethal fates to the characters in his principal novels and stories. Almayer (\"Almayer's Folly\", 1894), abandoned by his beloved daughter, takes to opium, and dies; Peter Willems (\"An Outcast of the Islands\", 1895) is killed by his jealous lover Aïssa; the ineffectual \"Nigger\", James Wait (\"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\", 1897), dies aboard ship and is buried at sea; Mr. Kurtz (\"Heart of Darkness\", 1899) expires, uttering the words, \"The horror! The horror!\"; \"Tuan\" Jim (\"Lord Jim\", 1900), having inadvertently precipitated a massacre of his adoptive community, deliberately walks to his death at the hands of the community's leader; in Conrad's 1901 short story, \"Amy Foster\", a Pole transplanted to England, Yanko Goorall (an English transliteration of the Polish \"Janko Góral\", \"Johnny Highlander\"), falls ill and, suffering from a fever, raves in his native language, frightening his wife Amy, who flees; next morning Yanko dies of heart failure, and it transpires that he had simply been asking in Polish for water; Captain Whalley (\"The End of the Tether\", 1902), betrayed by failing eyesight and an unscrupulous partner, drowns himself; Gian' Battista Fidanza, the eponymous respected Italian-immigrant \"Nostromo\" () of the novel \"Nostromo\" (1904), illicitly obtains a treasure of silver mined in the South American country of \"Costaguana\" and is shot dead due to mistaken identity; Mr. Verloc, \"The Secret Agent\" (1906) of divided loyalties, attempts a bombing, to be blamed on terrorists, that accidentally kills his mentally defective brother-in-law Stevie, and Verloc himself is killed by his distraught wife, who drowns herself by jumping overboard from a channel steamer; in \"Chance\" (1913), Roderick Anthony, a sailing-ship captain, and benefactor and husband of Flora de Barral, becomes the target of a poisoning attempt by her jealous disgraced financier father who, when detected, swallows the poison himself and dies (some years later, Captain Anthony drowns at sea); in \"Victory\" (1915), Lena is shot dead by Jones, who had meant to kill his accomplice Ricardo and later succeeds in doing so, then himself perishes along with another accomplice, after which Lena's protector Axel Heyst sets fire to his bungalow and dies beside Lena's body.\n\nWhen a principal character of Conrad's does escape with his life, he sometimes does not fare much better. In \"Under Western Eyes\" (1911), Razumov betrays a fellow University of St. Petersburg student, the revolutionist Victor Haldin, who has assassinated a savagely repressive Russian government minister. Haldin is tortured and hanged by the authorities. Later Razumov, sent as a government spy to Geneva, a centre of anti-tsarist intrigue, meets the mother and sister of Haldin, who share Haldin's liberal convictions. Razumov falls in love with the sister and confesses his betrayal of her brother; later he makes the same avowal to assembled revolutionists, and their professional executioner bursts his eardrums, making him deaf for life. Razumov staggers away, is knocked down by a streetcar, and finally returns as a cripple to Russia.\n\nConrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898, at the start of his writing career, he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham: \"What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. [A]s soon as you know of your slavery the pain, the anger, the strife—the tragedy begins.\" But in 1922, near the end of his life and career, when another Scottish friend, Richard Curle, sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad, the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. \"That reputation... has deprived me of innumerable readers... I absolutely object to being called a \"tragedian\".\"\n\nConrad claimed that he \"never kept a diary and never owned a notebook.\" John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as \"a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.\" Nevertheless, after Conrad's death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad's diaries describing his experiences in the Congo; in 1978 a more complete version was published as \"The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces\".\n\nUnlike many authors who make it a point not to discuss work in progress, Conrad often did discuss his current work and even showed it to select friends and fellow authors, such as Edward Garnett, and sometimes modified it in the light of their critiques and suggestions.\n\nEdward Said was struck by the sheer quantity of Conrad's correspondence with friends and fellow writers; by 1966, it \"amount[ed] to eight published volumes\". Edward Said comments: \"[I]t seemed to me that if Conrad wrote of himself, of the problem of self-definition, with such sustained urgency, some of what he wrote must have had meaning for his fiction. [I]t [was] difficult to believe that a man would be so uneconomical as to pour himself out in letter after letter and then not use and reformulate his insights and discoveries in his fiction.\" Edward Said found especially close parallels between Conrad's letters and his shorter fiction. \"Conrad... believed... that artistic distinction was more tellingly demonstrated in a shorter rather than a longer work... He believed that his [own] life was like a series of short episodes... because he was himself so many different people...: he was a Pole and an Englishman, a sailor and a writer.\" Another scholar, Najder, writes:\n\nConrad borrowed from other, Polish- and French-language authors, to an extent sometimes skirting plagiarism. When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel \"Victory\" appeared in 1931, readers noted striking similarities to Stefan Żeromski's kitschy novel, \"The History of a Sin\" (\"Dzieje grzechu\", 1908), including their endings. Comparative-literature scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of \"Victory\" a whole mosaic of influences, borrowings, similarities and allusions. He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other, mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrad's works, from \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895) to his unfinished \"Suspense\". Conrad seems to have used eminent writers' texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory. Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as allusions. Moreover, he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details, \"but [writes Najder] it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources, marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was, rather, an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw.\"\n\nConrad, like other artists, faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm its own favourable self-regard. This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the \"Judea\" in his 1898 story \"Youth\" as \"Liverpool hard cases\", whereas the crew of the \"Judea\"'s actual 1882 prototype, the \"Palestine\", had included not a single Liverpudlian, and half the crew had been non-Britons; and for Conrad's turning the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British Captain J. L. Clark, of the , in his 1900 novel \"Lord Jim\", into the captain of the fictitious \"Patna\"—\"a sort of renegade New South Wales German\" so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest \"a trained baby elephant.\" Similarly, in his letters Conrad—during most of his literary career, struggling for sheer financial survival—often adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents. And when he wished to criticise the conduct of European imperialism in what would later be termed the \"Third World\", he turned his gaze upon the Dutch and Belgian colonies, not upon the British Empire.\n\nThe singularity of the universe depicted in Conrad's novels, especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor John Galsworthy, is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to Graham Greene. But where \"Greeneland\" has been characterised as a recurring and recognisable atmosphere independent of setting, Conrad is at pains to create a sense of place, be it aboard ship or in a remote village; often he chose to have his characters play out their destinies in isolated or confined circumstances. In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powell's sequence, \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad. Leo Gurko, too, remarks, as \"one of Conrad's special qualities, his abnormal awareness of place, an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art, an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man.\"\n\nT. E. Lawrence, one of many writers whom Conrad befriended, offered some perceptive observations about Conrad's writing:\n\nThe Irish novelist-poet-critic Colm Tóibín captures something similar:\n\nIn a letter of 14 December 1897 to his Scottish friend, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, Conrad wrote that science tells us, \"Understand that thou art nothing, less than a shadow, more insignificant than a drop of water in the ocean, more fleeting than the illusion of a dream.\"\n\nIn a letter of 20 December 1897 to Cunninghame Graham, Conrad metaphorically described the universe as a huge machine:\n\nConrad wrote Cunninghame Graham on 31 January 1898:\n\nLeo Robson suggests that\nAccording to Robson,\n\nConrad spoke his native Polish and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties. He chose, however, to write his fiction in his third language, English. He says in his preface to \"A Personal Record\" that writing in English was for him \"natural\", and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French, as some had suggested, was in error. He explained that, though he had been familiar with French from childhood, \"I would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly 'crystallized'.\" In 1915, as Jo Davidson sculpted his bust, Conrad answered his question: \"Ah… to write French you have to know it. English is so plastic—if you haven't got a word you need you can make it, but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France.\" These statements, as so often in Conrad's \"autobiographical\" writings, are subtly disingenuous. In 1897 Conrad was visited by a fellow Pole, Wincenty Lutosławski, intent on imploring Conrad to write in Polish and \"[on] win[ning] Conrad for Polish literature\". Lutosławski recalls that Conrad explained why he did not write in Polish: \"I value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle. But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient: they enable me to earn my living\". Conrad later wrote Lutosławski to keep his visit a secret.\n\nConrad wrote in \"A Personal Record\" that English was \"the speech of my secret choice, of my future, of long friendships, of the deepest affections, of hours of toil and hours of ease, and of solitary hours, too, of books read, of thoughts pursued, of remembered emotions—of my very dreams!\" In 1878 Conrad's four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered that he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French. This, and some typically disastrous Conradian investments, had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt. With the concurrence of his mentor-uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, who had been summoned to Marseilles, Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine, which did not require Russia's permission. Thus began Conrad's sixteen years' seafarer's acquaintance with the British and with the English language.\n\nHad Conrad remained in the Francophone sphere or had he returned to Poland, the son of the Polish poet, playwright, and translator Apollo Korzeniowski—from childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature, and ambitious to himself become a writer—he might have ended writing in French or Polish instead of English. Certainly his Uncle Tadeusz thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew:\n\nIn the opinion of some biographers, Conrad's third language, English, remained under the influence of his first two languages—Polish and French. This makes his English seem unusual. Najder writes that:\n\nInevitably for a trilingual Polish–French–English-speaker, Conrad's writings occasionally show linguistic spillover: \"Franglais\" or \"Poglish\"—the inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary, grammar, or syntax in his English writings. In one instance, Najder uses \"several slips in vocabulary, typical for Conrad (Gallicisms) and grammar (usually Polonisms)\" as part of internal evidence against Conrad's sometime literary collaborator Ford Madox Ford's claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrad's novel \"Nostromo\", for publication in \"T. P.'s Weekly\", on behalf of an ill Conrad.\n\nThe impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be one's principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrad's 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish physicist, columnist, story-writer, and comedy-writer Bruno Winawer's short play, \"The Book of Job\". Najder writes:\n\nAs a practical matter, by the time Conrad set about writing fiction, he had little choice but to write in English. Poles who accused Conrad of cultural apostasy because he wrote in English instead of Polish missed the point—as do Anglophones who see, in Conrad's default choice of English as his artistic medium, a testimonial to some sort of innate superiority of the English language. According to Conrad's close friend and literary assistant Richard Curle, the fact of Conrad writing in English was \"obviously misleading\" because Conrad \"is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality\". Conrad, according to Curle, \"could never have written in any other language save the English language...for he would have been dumb in any other language but the English.\"\n\nConrad always retained a strong emotional attachment to his native language. He asked his visiting Polish niece Karola Zagórska, \"Will you forgive me that my sons don't speak Polish?\" In June 1924, shortly before his death, he apparently expressed a desire that his son John marry a Polish girl and learn Polish, and toyed with the idea of returning for good to now independent Poland.\n\nConrad bridled at being referred to as a Russian or \"Slavonic\" writer. The only Russian writer he admired was Ivan Turgenev. \"The critics,\" he wrote an acquaintance on 31 January 1924, six months before his death, \"detected in me a new note and as, just when I began to write, they had discovered the existence of Russian authors, they stuck that label on me under the name of Slavonism. What I venture to say is that it would have been more just to charge me at most with Polonism.\" However, though Conrad protested that Dostoyevsky was \"too Russian for me\" and that Russian literature generally was \"repugnant to me hereditarily and individually\", \"Under Western Eyes\" is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\".\n\nIn 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay, \"\", which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a \"thoroughgoing racist\". Achebe's view was that \"Heart of Darkness\" cannot be considered a great work of art because it is \"a novel which celebrates... dehumanisation, which depersonalises a portion of the human race.\" Referring to Conrad as a \"talented, tormented man\", Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to \"limbs\", \"ankles\", \"glistening white eyeballs\", etc. while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives—leading Marlow to sneer the word \"ugly.\" Achebe also cited Conrad's description of an encounter with an African: \"A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days.\" Achebe's essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate, and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad.\n\nAchebe's critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow's view from Conrad's, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his skepticism about the moral superiority of white men. This, indeed, is a central theme of the novel; Marlow's experiences in Africa expose the brutality of colonialism and its rationales. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, the novelist remarks: \"After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.\" Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad, like his acquaintance Roger Casement, \"was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War, to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.\" Likewise, E.D. Morel, who led international opposition to King Leopold II's rule in the Congo, saw Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as \"the most powerful thing written on the subject.\"\n\nConrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that \"nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference\". If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, since \"Heart of Darkness\" acknowledges racial distinctions \"but does not suggest an essential superiority\" of any group. Achebe's reading of \"Heart of Darkness\" can be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad's other African story, \"An Outpost of Progress\", which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow. Some younger scholars, such as Masood Ashraf Raja, have also suggested that if we read Conrad beyond \"Heart of Darkness\", especially his Malay novels, racism can be further complicated by foregrounding Conrad's positive representation of Muslims.\n\nIn 1998 H.S. Zins wrote in \"Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies\":\n\nAdam Hochschild makes a similar point:\n\nConrad's experience in the Belgian-run Congo made him one of the fiercest critics of the \"white man's mission.\" It was also, writes Najder, Conrad's most daring and last \"attempt to become a \"homo socialis\", a cog in the mechanism of society. By accepting the job in the trading company, he joined, for once in his life, an organized, large-scale group activity on land... It is not accidental that the Congo expedition remained an isolated event in Conrad's life. Until his death he remained a recluse in the social sense and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people.\"\n\nAn anchor-shaped monument to Conrad at Gdynia, on Poland's Baltic Seacoast, features a quotation from him in Polish: \"\"Nic tak nie nęci, nie rozczarowuje i nie zniewala, jak życie na morzu\"\" (\"[T]here is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea\" – ).\n\nIn Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia, a plaque in a \"writers walk\" commemorates Conrad's visits to Australia between 1879 and 1892. The plaque notes that \"Many of his works reflect his 'affection for that young continent.'\"\n\nIn San Francisco in 1979, a small triangular square at Columbus Avenue and Beach Street, near Fisherman's Wharf, was dedicated as \"Joseph Conrad Square\" after Conrad. The square's dedication was timed to coincide with release of Francis Ford Coppola's \"Heart of Darkness\"-inspired film, \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\nIn the latter part of World War II, the Royal Navy cruiser \"HMS Danae\" was rechristened ORP \"Conrad\" and served as part of the Polish Navy.\n\nNotwithstanding the undoubted sufferings that Conrad endured on many of his voyages, sentimentality and canny marketing place him at the best lodgings in several of his destinations. Hotels across the Far East still lay claim to him as an honoured guest, with, however, no evidence to back their claims: Singapore's Raffles Hotel continues to claim he stayed there though he lodged, in fact, at the Sailors' Home nearby. His visit to Bangkok also remains in that city's collective memory, and is recorded in the official history of The Oriental Hotel (where he never, in fact, stayed, lodging aboard his ship, the \"Otago\") along with that of a less well-behaved guest, Somerset Maugham, who pilloried the hotel in a short story in revenge for attempts to eject him.\n\nA plaque commemorating \"Joseph Conrad–Korzeniowski\" has been installed near Singapore's Fullerton Hotel.\n\nConrad is also reported to have stayed at Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel—at a port that, in fact, he never visited. Later literary admirers, notably Graham Greene, followed closely in his footsteps, sometimes requesting the same room and perpetuating myths that have no basis in fact. No Caribbean resort is yet known to have claimed Conrad's patronage, although he is believed to have stayed at a Fort-de-France \"pension\" upon arrival in Martinique on his first voyage, in 1875, when he travelled as a passenger on the \"Mont Blanc\".\n\nIn April 2013, a monument to Conrad was unveiled in the Russian town of Vologda, where he and his parents lived in exile in 1862–63. The monument was removed, with unclear explanation, in June 2016.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Chance\" in 1913, Conrad was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Edward Garnett, Garnett's wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, André Gide, Paul Valéry, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, Józef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of \"Conrad and His Contemporaries\"). Conrad encouraged and mentored younger writers. In the early 1900s he composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford.\n\nIn 1919 and 1922 Conrad's growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. It was apparently the French and Swedes—not the English—who favoured Conrad's candidacy. \n\nIn April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (\"Nałęcz\"), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conrad kept a distance from official structures—he never voted in British national elections—and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities.\n\nIn the Polish People's Republic, translations of Conrad's works were openly published, except for \"Under Western Eyes\", which in the 1980s was published as an underground \"\"bibuła\"\".\n\nConrad's narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T. S. Eliot, Maria Dąbrowska, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Gerald Basil Edwards, Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, André Malraux, George Orwell, Graham Greene, William Golding, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Gabriel García Márquez, Peter Matthiessen, John le Carré, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, Thomas Pynchon J. M. Coetzee, and Salman Rushdie. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad's works.\n\nA striking portrait of Conrad, aged about 46, was drawn by the historian and poet Henry Newbolt, who met him about 1903:\n\nOn 12 October 1912, American music critic James Huneker visited Conrad and later recalled being received by \"a man of the world, neither sailor nor novelist, just a simple-mannered gentleman, whose welcome was sincere, whose glance was veiled, at times far-away, whose ways were French, Polish, anything but 'literary,' bluff or English.\"\n\nAfter respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913, two British aristocrats, the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell and the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell—who were lovers at the time—recorded their impressions of the novelist. In her diary, Morrell wrote:\n\nA month later, Bertrand Russell visited Conrad at Capel House, and the same day on the train wrote down his impressions:\n\nRussell's \"Autobiography\", published over half a century later in 1968, confirms his original experience:\n\nIt was not only Anglophones who remarked on Conrad's very strong foreign accent when speaking English. After he had made the acquaintance of French poet Paul Valéry and composer Maurice Ravel in December 1922, Valéry wrote of having been astonished at Conrad's \"horrible\" accent in English.\n\nThe subsequent friendship and correspondence between Conrad and Russell lasted, with long intervals, to the end of Conrad's life. In one letter, Conrad avowed his \"deep admiring affection, which, if you were never to see me again and forget my existence tomorrow will be unalterably yours \"usque ad finem\".\" Conrad in his correspondence often used the Latin expression meaning \"to the very end\", which he seems to have adopted from his faithful guardian, mentor and benefactor, his maternal uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski.\n\nConrad looked with less optimism than Russell on the possibilities of scientific and philosophic knowledge. In a 1913 letter to acquaintances who had invited Conrad to join their society, he reiterated his belief that it was impossible to understand the essence of either reality or life: both science and art penetrate no further than the outer shapes.\n\nNajder describes Conrad as \"[a]n alienated émigré... haunted by a sense of the unreality of other people – a feeling natural to someone living outside the established structures of family, social milieu, and country\".\nConrad's sense of loneliness throughout his exile's life found memorable expression in the 1901 short story, \"Amy Foster\".\n\nBULLET::::- \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895)\nBULLET::::- \"An Outcast of the Islands\" (1896)\nBULLET::::- \"The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'\" (1897)\nBULLET::::- \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899)\nBULLET::::- \"Lord Jim\" (1900)\nBULLET::::- \"The Inheritors\" (with Ford Madox Ford) (1901)\nBULLET::::- \"Typhoon\" (1902, begun 1899)\nBULLET::::- \"The End of the Tether\" (written in 1902; collected in \"Youth, a Narrative and Two Other Stories\", 1902)\nBULLET::::- \"Romance\" (with Ford Madox Ford, 1903)\nBULLET::::- \"Nostromo\" (1904)\nBULLET::::- \"The Secret Agent\" (1907)\nBULLET::::- \"Under Western Eyes\" (1911)\nBULLET::::- \"Chance\" (1913)\nBULLET::::- \"Victory\" (1915)\nBULLET::::- \"The Shadow Line\" (1917)\nBULLET::::- \"The Arrow of Gold\" (1919)\nBULLET::::- \"The Rescue\" (1920)\nBULLET::::- \"The Nature of a Crime\" (1923, with Ford Madox Ford)\nBULLET::::- \"The Rover\" (1923)\nBULLET::::- \"\" (1925; unfinished, published posthumously)\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Black Mate\": written, according to Conrad, in 1886; may be counted as his opus double zero; published 1908; posthumously collected in \"Tales of Hearsay\", 1925.\nBULLET::::- \"The Idiots\": Conrad's truly first short story, which may be counted as his opus zero; written during his honeymoon (1896), published in \"The Savoy\" periodical, 1896, and collected in \"Tales of Unrest\", 1898.\nBULLET::::- \"The Lagoon\": composed 1896; published in \"Cornhill Magazine\", 1897; collected in \"Tales of Unrest\", 1898: \"It is the first short story I ever wrote.\"\nBULLET::::- \"An Outpost of Progress\": written 1896; published in \"\", 1897, and collected in \"Tales of Unrest\", 1898: \"My next [second] effort in short-story writing\"; it shows numerous thematic affinities with \"Heart of Darkness\"; in 1906, Conrad described it as his \"best story\".\nBULLET::::- \"The Return\": completed early 1897, while writing \"Karain\"; never published in magazine form; collected in \"Tales of Unrest\", 1898: \"[A]ny kind word about 'The Return' (and there have been such words said at different times) awakens in me the liveliest gratitude, for I know how much the writing of that fantasy has cost me in sheer toil, in temper, and in disillusion.\" Conrad, who suffered while writing this psychological \"chef-d'oeuvre\" of introspection, once remarked: \"I hate it.\"\nBULLET::::- \"Karain: A Memory\": written February–April 1897; published November 1897 in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" and collected in \"Tales of Unrest\", 1898: \"my third short story in... order of time\".\nBULLET::::- \"Youth\": written 1898; collected in \"Youth, a Narrative, and Two Other Stories\", 1902\nBULLET::::- \"Falk\": novella / story, written early 1901; collected only in \"Typhoon and Other Stories\", 1903\nBULLET::::- \"Amy Foster\": composed 1901; published in the \"Illustrated London News\", December 1901, and collected in \"Typhoon and Other Stories\", 1903.\nBULLET::::- \"To-morrow\": written early 1902; serialised in \"The Pall Mall Magazine\", 1902, and collected in \"Typhoon and Other Stories\", 1903\nBULLET::::- \"Gaspar Ruiz\": written after \"Nostromo\" in 1904–5; published in \"The Strand Magazine\", 1906, and collected in \"A Set of Six\", 1908 (UK), 1915 (US).

{"id": "15824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15824", "title": "John Updike", "text": "John Updike\n\nJohn Hoyer Updike (March 18, 1932 – January 27, 2009) was an American novelist, poet, short-story writer, art critic, and literary critic. One of only three writers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others being Booth Tarkington and William Faulkner), Updike published more than twenty novels, more than a dozen short-story collections, as well as poetry, art and literary criticism and children's books during his career.\n\nHundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in \"The New Yorker\" starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for \"The New York Review of Books\". His most famous work is his \"Rabbit\" series (the novels \"Rabbit, Run\"; \"Rabbit Redux\"; \"Rabbit Is Rich\"; \"Rabbit at Rest\"; and the novella \"Rabbit Remembered\"), which chronicles the life of the middle-class everyman Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom over the course of several decades, from young adulthood to death. Both \"Rabbit Is Rich\" (1982) and \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1990) were recognized with the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nDescribing his subject as \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", Updike was recognized for his careful craftsmanship, his unique prose style, and his prolific outputhe wrote on average a book a year. Updike populated his fiction with characters who \"frequently experience personal turmoil and must respond to crises relating to religion, family obligations, and marital infidelity\".\n\nHis fiction is distinguished by its attention to the concerns, passions, and suffering of average Americans, its emphasis on Christian theology, and its preoccupation with sexuality and sensual detail. His work has attracted significant critical attention and praise, and he is widely considered one of the great American writers of his time. Updike's highly distinctive prose style features a rich, unusual, sometimes arcane vocabulary as conveyed through the eyes of \"a wry, intelligent authorial voice\" that describes the physical world extravagantly while remaining squarely in the realist tradition. He described his style as an attempt \"to give the mundane its beautiful due\".\n\nUpdike was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the only child of Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother's attempts to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. \"One of my earliest memories\", he later recalled, \"is of seeing her at her desk ... I admired the writer's equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in.\"\n\nThese early years in Berks County, Pennsylvania, would influence the environment of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, as well as many of his early novels and short stories. Updike graduated from Shillington High School as co-valedictorian and class president in 1950 and received a full scholarship to Harvard College, where he was the roommate of Christopher Lasch during their first year. Updike had already received recognition for his writing as a teenager by winning a Scholastic Art & Writing Award, and at Harvard he soon became well known among his classmates as a talented and prolific contributor to \"The Harvard Lampoon\", of which he served as president. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1954 with a degree in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nUpon graduation, Updike attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at the University of Oxford with the ambition of becoming a cartoonist. After returning to the United States, Updike and his family moved to New York, where he became a regular contributor to \"The New Yorker\". This was the beginning of his professional writing career.\n\nUpdike stayed at \"The New Yorker\" as a full staff writer for only two years, writing \"Talk of the Town\" columns and submitting poetry and short stories to the magazine. In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like \"The Carpentered Hen\" (1958) and \"The Same Door\" (1959). These works were influenced by Updike's early engagement with \"The New Yorker\". This early work also featured the influence of J. D. Salinger (\"A&P\"); John Cheever (\"Snowing in Greenwich Village\"); and the Modernists Marcel Proust, Henry Green, James Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nDuring this time, Updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis. Suffering from a loss of religious faith, he began reading Søren Kierkegaard and the theologian Karl Barth. Both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs, which in turn figured prominently in his fiction. Updike remained a believing Christian for the rest of his life.\n\nLater, Updike and his family relocated to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Many commentators, including a columnist in the local \"Ipswich Chronicle\", asserted that the fictional town of Tarbox in \"Couples\" was based on Ipswich. Updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper. Impressions of Updike's day-to-day life in Ipswich during the 1960s and 1970s are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after Updike's death and written by a friend and contemporary. In Ipswich, Updike wrote \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960), on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and \"The Centaur\" (1963), two of his most acclaimed and famous works; the latter won the National Book Award.\n\n\"Rabbit, Run\" featured Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become Updike's most enduring and critically acclaimed character. Updike wrote three additional novels about him. \"Rabbit, Run\" was featured in \"Time\"s All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.\n\nUpdike's career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with \"The New Yorker\", which published him frequently throughout his career, despite the fact that he had departed the magazine's employment after only two years. Updike's memoir indicates that he stayed in his \"corner of New England to give its domestic news\" with a focus on the American home from the point of view of a male writer. Updike's contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts, but William Shawn, \"The New Yorker\"'s editor from 1952 to 1987, rejected several as too explicit.\n\nThe Maple short stories, collected in \"Too Far To Go\" (1979), reflected the ebb and flow of Updike's first marriage; \"Separating\" (1974) and \"Here Come the Maples\" (1976) related to his divorce. These stories also reflect the role of alcohol in 1970s America. They were the basis for the television movie also called \"Too Far To Go\", broadcast by NBC in 1979.\n\nUpdike's short stories were collected in several volumes published by Alfred A. Knopf over five decades. In 2013, the Library of America issued a two-volume boxed edition of 186 stories under the title \"The Collected Stories\".\n\nIn 1971, Updike published a sequel to \"Rabbit, Run\" called \"Rabbit Redux\", his response to the 1960s; Rabbit reflected much of Updike's resentment and hostility towards the social and political changes that beset the United States during that time.\n\nUpdike's early Olinger period was set in the Pennsylvania of his youth; it ended around 1965 with the lyrical \"Of the Farm\".\n\nAfter his early novels, Updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity, adultery, and marital unrest, especially in suburban America; and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores.\n\n\"The Coup\" (1978), a lauded novel about an African dictatorship inspired by a visit he made to Africa, found Updike working in new territory.\n\nIn 1980, he published another novel featuring Harry Angstrom, \"Rabbit Is Rich\", which won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—all three major American literary prizes. The novel found \"Rabbit the fat and happy owner of a Toyota dealership.\" Updike found it difficult to end the book, because he was \"having so much fun\" in the imaginary county Rabbit and his family inhabited.\n\nAfter writing \"Rabbit Is Rich\", Updike published \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), a playful novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He described it as an attempt to \"make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors\". One of Updike's most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom's list of canonical 20th-century literature (in \"The Western Canon\"). In 2008 Updike published \"The Widows of Eastwick\", a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.\n\nIn 1986, he published the unconventional novel \"Roger's Version\", the second volume of the so-called \"Scarlet Letter\" trilogy, about an attempt to prove God's existence using a computer program. Author and critic Martin Amis called it a \"near-masterpiece\". The novel \"S.\" (1989), uncharacteristically featuring a female protagonist, concluded Updike's reworking of Hawthorne's \"Scarlet Letter\".\n\nUpdike enjoyed working in series; in addition to the Rabbit novels and the Maples stories, a recurrent Updike alter ego is the moderately well-known, unprolific Jewish novelist and eventual Nobel laureate Henry Bech, chronicled in three comic short-story cycles: \"Bech, a Book\" (1970), \"Bech Is Back\" (1981) and \"Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel\" (1998). These stories were compiled as \"The Complete Henry Bech\" (2001) by Everyman's Library. Bech is a comical and self-conscious antithesis of Updike's own literary persona: Jewish, a World War II veteran, reclusive, and unprolific to a fault.\n\nIn 1990, he published the last Rabbit novel, \"Rabbit at Rest\", which won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike's most celebrated. In 2000, Updike included the novella \"Rabbit Remembered\" in his collection \"Licks of Love\", drawing the Rabbit saga to a close. His Pulitzers for the last two Rabbit novels make Updike one of only three writers to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, the others being William Faulkner and Booth Tarkington.\n\nIn 1995, Everyman's Library collected and canonized the four novels as the omnibus \"Rabbit Angstrom\"; Updike wrote an introduction in which he described Rabbit as \"a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight.\" Updike later called Rabbit \"a brother to me, and a good friend. He opened me up as a writer.\"\n\nAfter the publication of \"Rabbit at Rest\", Updike spent the rest of the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of \"Memories of the Ford Administration\" (1992), the magical realism of \"Brazil\" (1994), the science fiction of \"Toward the End of Time\" (1997), the postmodernism of \"Gertrude and Claudius\" (2000), and the experimental fiction of \"Seek My Face\" (2002).\n\nIn the midst of these, he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel, \"In the Beauty of the Lilies\" (1996), a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in America. It is considered the most successful novel of Updike's late career. Some critics have predicted that posterity may consider the novel a \"late masterpiece overlooked or praised by rote in its day, only to be rediscovered by another generation\", while others thought it overlong and depressing. In \"Villages\" (2004), Updike returned to the familiar territory of infidelities in New England. His 22nd novel, \"Terrorist\" (2006), the story of a fervent young extremist Muslim in New Jersey, garnered media attention but little critical praise.\n\nIn 2003, Updike published \"\", a large collection of his short fiction spanning the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. More than 800 pages long, with over one hundred stories, it has been called \"a richly episodic and lyrical \"Bildungsroman\" ... in which Updike traces the trajectory from adolescence, college, married life, fatherhood, separation and divorce\". It won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2004. This lengthy volume nevertheless excluded several stories found in his short-story collections of the same period.\n\nUpdike worked in a wide array of genres, including fiction, poetry (most of it compiled in \"Collected Poems: 1953–1993\", 1993), essays (collected in nine separate volumes), a play (\"Buchanan Dying\", 1974), and a memoir (\"Self-Consciousness\", 1989).\n\nUpdike's array of awards includes two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, two National Book Awards, three National Book Critics Circle awards, the 1989 National Medal of Arts, the 2003 National Humanities Medal, and the Rea Award for the Short Story for outstanding achievement. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Updike to present the 2008 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government's highest humanities honor; Updike's lecture was titled \"The Clarity of Things: What Is American about American Art\".\n\nAt the end of his life, Updike was working on a novel about St. Paul and early Christianity. Upon his death, \"The New Yorker\" published an appreciation by Adam Gopnik of Updike's lifetime association with the magazine, calling him \"one of the greatest of all modern writers, the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing\".\n\nUpdike married Mary E. Pennington, an art student at Radcliffe College, in 1953, while he was still a student at Harvard. She accompanied him to Oxford, England, where he attended art school and where their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1955. The couple had three more children together: writer David (born 1957), artist Michael (born 1959) and Miranda (born 1960). They divorced in 1974. Updike had seven grandsons, Anoff, Kwame, Wesley, Trevor, Kai, Sawyer and Seneca.\n\nIn 1977 Updike married Martha Ruggles Bernhard, with whom he lived for more than thirty years in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. He died of lung cancer at a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, on January 27, 2009, at the age of 76.\n\nUpdike published eight volumes of poetry over his career, including his first book \"The Carpentered Hen\" (1958), and one of his last, the posthumous \"Endpoint\" (2009). The \"New Yorker\" published excerpts of \"Endpoint\" in its March 16, 2009 issue. Much of Updike's poetical output was recollected in Knopf's \"Collected Poems\" (1993). He wrote that \"I began as a writer of light verse, and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form.\" The poet Thomas M. Disch noted that because Updike was such a well-known novelist, his poetry \"could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible\"; Disch saw Updike's light verse instead as a poetry of \"epigrammatical lucidity\". His poetry has been praised for its engagement with \"a variety of forms and topics\", its \"wit and precision\", and for its depiction of topics familiar to American readers.\n\nBritish poet Gavin Ewart praised Updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability \"to make the ordinary seem strange\", and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry. Reading \"Endpoint\" aloud, the critic Charles McGrath claimed that he found \"another, deeper music\" in Updike's poetry, finding that Updike's wordplay \"smooths and elides itself\" and has many subtle \"sound effects\". John Keenan, who praised the collection \"Endpoint\" as \"beautiful and poignant\", noted that his poetry's engagement with \"the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him\".\n\nUpdike was also a critic of literature and art, one frequently cited as one of the best American critics of his generation. In the introduction to \"Picked-Up Pieces,\" his 1975 collection of prose, he listed his personal rules for literary criticism:\n\n1. Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt.\n\n2. Give enough direct quotation—at least one extended passage—of the book's prose so the review's reader can form his own impression, can get his own taste.\n\n3. Confirm your description of the book with quotation from the book, if only phrase-long, rather than proceeding by fuzzy précis.\n\n4. Go easy on plot summary, and do not give away the ending.\n\n5. If the book is judged deficient, cite a successful example along the same lines, from the author's œuvre or elsewhere. Try to understand the failure. Sure it's his and not yours?\n\nTo these concrete five might be added a vaguer sixth, having to do with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never ... try to put the author \"in his place,\" making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.\n\nHe reviewed \"nearly every major writer of the 20th century and some 19th-century authors\", typically in \"The New Yorker\", always trying to make his reviews \"animated.\" He also championed young writers, comparing them to his own literary heroes including Vladimir Nabokov and Marcel Proust. Good reviews from Updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales; some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as Erica Jong, Thomas Mallon and Jonathan Safran Foer.\n\nBad reviews by Updike sometimes caused controversy, as when in late 2008 he gave a \"damning\" review of Toni Morrison's novel \"A Mercy\".\n\nUpdike was praised for his literary criticism's conventional simplicity and profundity, for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms, and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism.\n\nMuch of Updike's art criticism appeared in \"The New York Review of Books\", where he often wrote about American art. His art criticism involved an aestheticism like that of his literary criticism.\n\nUpdike's 2008 Jefferson Lecture, \"The Clarity of Things: What's American About American Art?\", dealt with the uniqueness of American art from the 18th century to the 20th. In the lecture he argued that American art, until the expressionist movement of the 20th century in which America declared its artistic \"independence\", is characterized by an insecurity not found in the artistic tradition of Europe.\"\n\nIn Updike's own words:\n\nTwo centuries after Jonathan Edwards sought a link with the divine in the beautiful clarity of things, William Carlos Williams wrote in introducing his long poem \"Paterson\" that \"for the poet there are no ideas but in things.\" \"No ideas but in things.\" The American artist, first born into a continent without museums and art schools, took Nature as his only instructor, and things as his principal study. A bias toward the empirical, toward the evidential object in the numinous fullness of its being, leads to a certain lininess, as the artist intently maps the visible in a New World that feels surrounded by chaos and emptiness.\n\nUpdike is considered one of the greatest American fiction writers of his generation. He was widely praised as America's \"last true man of letters\", with an immense and far-reaching influence on many writers. The excellence of his prose style is acknowledged even by critics skeptical of other aspects of Updike's work.\n\nCritics emphasize his \"inimitable prose style\" and \"rich description and language\", often favorably compared to Proust and Nabokov. Some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault, questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes, while others criticized Updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships.\n\nOther critics argue that Updike's \"dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader\". On the whole, however, Updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres, wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style, with \"shrewd insight into the sorrows, frustrations, and banality of American life\".\n\nUpdike's character Rabbit Angstrom, the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his \"magnum opus\", has been said to have \"entered the pantheon of signal American literary figures\", along with Huckleberry Finn, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield and others. A 2002 list by \"Book\" magazine of the 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 listed Rabbit in the top five. The Rabbit novels, the Henry Bech stories, and the Maples stories have been canonized by Everyman's Library.\n\nAfter Updike's death, Harvard's Houghton Library acquired his papers, manuscripts, and letters, naming the collection the John Updike Archive. 2009 also saw the founding of the John Updike Society, a group of scholars dedicated to \"awakening and sustaining reader interest in the literature and life of John Updike, promoting literature written by Updike, and fostering and encouraging critical responses to Updike's literary works.\" The Society will begin publishing \"The John Updike Review\", a journal of critical scholarship in the field of Updike studies. The John Updike Society First Biennial Conference took place in 2010 at Alvernia University.\n\nEulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist Ian McEwan wrote that Updike's \"literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the Shakespearean\", and that Updike's death marked \"the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century's second half.\"\n\nMcEwan said the Rabbit series is Updike's \"masterpiece and will surely be his monument\", and concluded:\n\nJonathan Raban, highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to Updike's prose, called \"Rabbit at Rest\" \"one of the very few modern novels in English ... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, and not feel the draft ... It is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details, of shades and nuances, of the byplay between one sentence and the next, and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness.\"\n\nThe novelist Philip Roth, considered one of Updike's chief literary rivals, wrote, \"John Updike is our time's greatest man of letters, as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer. He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\"\n\nThe noted critic James Wood called Updike \"a prose writer of great beauty, but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough, and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey\". In a review of \"Licks of Love\" (2001), Wood concluded that Updike's \"prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons\" but that there often exists in his work a \"hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview\". Wood both praised and criticized Updike's language for having \"an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract\". According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing \"the perfect sentence\" and his style is characterized by a \"delicate deferral\" of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike's language and his faith in the power of that language floats above reality, Wood wrote:\n\nFor some time now Updike's language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books—here extended a further instance—suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us—'life's gallant, battered ongoingness ', indeed—and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike's language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.\n\nIn direct contrast to Wood's evaluation, the Oxford critic Thomas Karshan asserted that Updike is \"intensely intellectual\", with a style that constitutes his \"manner of thought\" not merely \"a set of dainty curlicues\". Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the \"traditional role of the epic writer\". According to Karshan, \"Updike's writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child.\"\n\nDisagreeing with Wood's critique of Updike's alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike's language as convincingly naturalistic:\n\nUpdike's sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith. Rather, like Proust's sentences in Updike's description, they \"seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith.\" Updike aspires to \"this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that Cézanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs.\" Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world. But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them.\n\nHarold Bloom once called Updike \"a minor novelist with a major style. A quite beautiful and very considerable stylist ... He specializes in the easier pleasures.\" Bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on Updike in 1987, in which he concluded that Updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are \"beyond praise\"; nevertheless, Bloom went on, \"the American sublime will never touch his pages\".\n\nOn \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1981, the novelist and short-story writer John Cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review \"Rabbit Is Rich\". He replied:\n\nThe reason I didn't review the book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My appreciation of it is that diverse and that complicated ... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.\n\n\"The Fiction Circus\", an online and multimedia literary magazine, called Updike one of the \"four Great American Novelists\" of his time along with Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo, each jokingly represented as a sign of the Zodiac. Furthermore, Updike was seen as the \"best prose writer in the world\", like Nabokov before him. But in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries, the \"Circus\" asserted that nobody \"thought of Updike as a \"vital\" writer.\"\n\nAdam Gopnik of \"The New Yorker\" evaluated Updike as \"the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing ... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction—the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite to get it all in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly—were both alive in him.\"\n\nThe critic James Wolcott, in a review of Updike's last novel, \"The Widows of Eastwick\" (2008), noted that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an affirmation of America's ultimate merits: \"Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden dab of sperm.\"\n\nGore Vidal, in a controversial essay in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", professed to have \"never taken Updike seriously as a writer\". He criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its \"blandness and acceptance of authority in any form\". He concludes that Updike \"describes to no purpose\". In reference to Updike's wide establishment acclaim, Vidal mockingly called him \"our good child\" and excoriated his alleged political conservatism. Vidal ultimately concluded, \"Updike's work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where Authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up.\"\n\nRobert B. Silvers, editor of \"The New York Review of Books\", called Updike \"one of the most elegant and coolly observant writers of his generation\".\n\nThe short-story writer Lorrie Moore, who once described Updike as \"American literature's greatest short story writer ... and arguably our greatest writer\", reviewed Updike's body of short stories in \"The New York Review\", praising their intricate detail and rich imagery: \"his eye and his prose never falter, even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his story's way\".\n\nIn a post commemorating his birthday in 2011, blogger and literary critic Christy Potter called Updike \"... THE Writer, the kind of writer everyone has heard of, the one whose name you can bring up at a party and people who have never read one thing he wrote will still nod their heads knowingly and say, 'Oh yes, John Updike. The writer.'\"\n\nDuring November 2008 the editors of the UK's \"Literary Review\" magazine awarded Updike their Bad Sex in Fiction Lifetime Achievement Award, which celebrates \"crude, tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature\".\n\nThe principal themes in Updike's work are religion, sex, and America as well as death. Often he would combine them, frequently in his favored terrain of \"the American small town, Protestant middle class\", of which he once said, \"I like middles. It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.\"\n\nFor example, the decline of religion in America is chronicled in \"In the Beauty of the Lilies\" (1996) alongside the history of cinema, and Rabbit Angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend Reverend Jack Eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in \"Rabbit, Run\" (1960).\n\nCritics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike's novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.\n\nDescribing his purpose in writing prose, Updike himself, in the introduction to his \"Early Stories: 1953–1975\" (2004), wrote that his aim was always \"to give the mundane its beautiful due.\" Elsewhere he famously said, \"When I write, I aim my mind not towards New York City but towards a vague spot east of Kansas.\" Some have suggested that the \"best statement of Updike's aesthetic comes in his early memoir 'The Dogwood Tree'\" (1962): \"Blankness is not emptiness; we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else. And in fact there is a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.\"\n\nSex in Updike's work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it:\n\nThe critic Edward Champion notes that Updike's prose heavily favors \"external sexual imagery\" rife with \"explicit anatomical detail\" rather than descriptions of \"internal emotion\" in descriptions of sex. In Champion's interview with Updike on \"The Bat Segundo Show\", Updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex \"real\" in his prose. Another sexual theme commonly addressed in Updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in \"Couples\" (1968). The Updikean narrator is often \"a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family.\"\n\nSimilarly, Updike wrote about America with a certain nostalgia, reverence, and recognition and celebration of America's broad diversity. ZZ Packer wrote that in Updike, \"there seemed a strange ability to harken both America the Beautiful as well as America the Plain Jane, and the lovely Protestant backbone in his fiction and essays, when he decided to show it off, was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic.\"\n\nThe Rabbit novels in particular can be viewed, according to Julian Barnes, as \"a distraction from, and a glittering confirmation of, the vast bustling ordinariness of American life.\" But as Updike celebrated ordinary America, he also alluded to its decline: at times, he was \"so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of America.\" Adam Gopnik concludes that \"Updike's great subject was the American attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture. He documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and Toyotas and family love and family obligation. For Updike, this effort was blessed, and very nearly successful.\"\n\nUpdike's novels about America almost always contain references to political events of the time. In this sense, they are artifacts of their historical eras, showing how national leaders shape and define their times. The lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background.\n\nUpdike often wrote about death, his characters providing a \"mosaic of reactions\" to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In \"The Poorhouse Fair\" (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, \"There is no goodness without belief ... And if you have not believed, at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next\", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.\n\nFor Rabbit Angstrom, with his constant musings on mortality, his near-witnessing of his daughter's death, and his often shaky faith, death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications. At the end of \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1990), though, Rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty, telling his son Nelson on his deathbed, \"... But enough. Maybe. Enough.\" In \"The Centaur\" (1963), George Caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer. Death can also be a sort of unseen terror; it \"occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence.\"\n\nUpdike himself also experienced a \"crisis over the afterlife\", and indeed\n\nmany of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man: Henry Bech's concern that he was 'a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust,' or Colonel Ellelloû's lament that 'we will be forgotten, all of us forgotten.' Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God—looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with 'its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.'\n\nUpdike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings, including the poem \"Perfection Wasted\" (1990):\n\nBULLET::::- Updike was featured on the cover of \"Time\" twice, on April 26, 1968 and again on October 18, 1982.\nBULLET::::- Updike was the subject of a \"closed book examination\" by Nicholson Baker, titled \"U and I\" (1991).

{"id": "15825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15825", "title": "John Steinbeck", "text": "John Steinbeck\n\nJohn Ernst Steinbeck Jr. (; February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American author. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception.\" He has been called \"a giant of American letters,\" and many of his works are considered classics of Western literature.\n\nDuring his writing career, he authored 33 books, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels \"Tortilla Flat\" (1935) and \"Cannery Row\" (1945), the multi-generation epic \"East of Eden\" (1952), and the novellas \"Of Mice and Men\" (1937) and \"The Red Pony\" (1937). The Pulitzer Prize-winning \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75 years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.\n\nMost of Steinbeck's work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.\n\nSteinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California. He was of German, English, and Irish descent. Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck (1828–1913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather, shortened the family name to Steinbeck when he immigrated to the United States. The family farm in Heiligenhaus, Mettmann, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, is still named \"Großsteinbeck.\"\n\nHis father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), served as Monterey County treasurer. John's mother, Olive Hamilton (1867–1934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck's passion for reading and writing. The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church, although Steinbeck later became agnostic. Steinbeck lived in a small rural valley (no more than a frontier settlement) set in some of the world's most fertile soil, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. He spent his summers working on nearby ranches and later with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in \"Of Mice and Men\". He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.\nSteinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English Literature at Stanford University near Palo Alto, leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at Lake Tahoe, where he met Carol Henning, his first wife. They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster mannequins.\n\nWhen their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to Pacific Grove, California, to a cottage owned by his father, on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks outside the Monterey city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the Great Depression, Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market. Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends. Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel \"Cannery Row\".\n\nIn 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology. Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from Warder Clyde Allee, a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand. Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck's wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper. Steinbeck helped on an informal basis. They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art, and John learned biology and Ricketts' ecological philosophy. When Steinbeck became emotionally upset, Ricketts sometimes played music for him.\n\nSteinbeck's first novel, \"\", published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan. It centers on Morgan's assault and sacking of the city of Panama, sometimes referred to as the \"Cup of Gold\", and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there.\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. \"The Pastures of Heaven\", published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published \"The Red Pony\", a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood. \"To a God Unknown\", named after a Vedic hymn, follows the life of a homesteader and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works. Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.\n\nSteinbeck achieved his first critical success with \"Tortilla Flat\" (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California Commonwealth Club's Gold Medal. It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited \"spicy and comic tales about a gang of \"paisanos\", asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.\"\n\"Tortilla Flat\" was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, a friend of Steinbeck. With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in Los Gatos.\n\nSteinbeck began to write a series of \"California novels\" and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression. These included \"In Dubious Battle\", \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\". He also wrote an article series called \"The Harvest Gypsies\" for the \"San Francisco News\" about the plight of the migrant worker.\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was a drama about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. It was critically acclaimed and Steinbeck's 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a \"little masterpiece\".\nIts stage production was a hit, starring Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director George S. Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind was \"perfect\" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (\"The Moon Is Down\" and \"Burning Bright\").\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film, with Lon Chaney, Jr. as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and Burgess Meredith as George. Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades. Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.\n\nSteinbeck followed this wave of success with \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to \"The New York Times\", it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Later that year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was adapted as a film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Fonda was nominated for the best actor Academy Award.\n\"Grapes\" was controversial. Steinbeck's New Deal political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author, especially close to home. Claiming the book was both obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. This ban lasted until January 1941.\n\nOf the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, \"The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I'm frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing. It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.\"\n\nThe film versions of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"Of Mice and Men\" (by two different movie studios) were in production simultaneously, allowing Steinbeck to spend a full day on the set of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and the next day on the set of \"Of Mice and Men.\"\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck's writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their joint book about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well. However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as \"The Log from the Sea of Cortez\", under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.\n\nAlthough Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book. In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger. With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, Thomas (\"Thom\") Myles Steinbeck (1944–2016) and John Steinbeck IV (1946–1991).\n\nRicketts was Steinbeck's model for the character of \"Doc\" in \"Cannery Row\" (1945) and \"Sweet Thursday\" (1954), \"Friend Ed\" in \"Burning Bright\", and characters in \"In Dubious Battle\" (1936) and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck's novels of the period.\n\nSteinbeck's close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol. Ricketts' biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for \"East of Eden\" (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts' untimely death in 1948.\n\nSteinbeck's novel \"The Moon Is Down\" (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and the occupiers the Nazis. In 1945, Steinbeck received the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross for his literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement.\n\nIn 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II war correspondent for the \"New York Herald Tribune\" and worked with the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the CIA). It was at that time he became friends with Will Lang, Jr. of \"Time\"/\"Life\" magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and helped capture Italian and German prisoners, using a Tommy Gun. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary \"Once There Was a War\" (1958).\n\nSteinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote Alfred Hitchcock's movie, \"Lifeboat\" (1944), and the film, \"A Medal for Benny\" (1945), with screenwriter Jack Wagner about paisanos from \"Tortilla Flat\" going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of \"Lifeboat,\" because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote \"Cannery Row\" (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row.\n\nAfter the war, he wrote \"The Pearl\" (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of Woman's Home Companion magazine as \"The Pearl of the World.\" It was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in \"The Log From the Sea of Cortez\", which he described in Chapter 11 as being \"so much like a parable that it almost can't be\". Steinbeck traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata, and subsequently wrote a film script (\"Viva Zapata!\") directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.\n\nIn 1947, Steinbeck made the first of many trips to the Soviet Union, this one with photographer Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, \"A Russian Journal\", was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, \"East of Eden\", was published. According to his third wife, Elaine, he considered it his \"magnum opus\", his greatest novel.\n\nIn 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of 20th Century Fox's film, \"O. Henry's Full House\". Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O. Henry. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records; the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Viva Zapata!\", Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on \"East of Eden\", James Dean's film debut.\n\"\" is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for America. According to Steinbeck's son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.\n\nSteinbeck's last novel, \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" (1961), examines moral decline in America. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him. The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck's amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like \"Tortilla Flat\" and \"Cannery Row\". It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel, but were disappointed that it was not another \"Grapes of Wrath\".\nIn the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: \"Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.\"\n\nApparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.\n\nIn 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his \"realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception.\" The selection was heavily criticized, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The \"New York Times\" asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose \"limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", noting that \"[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\". Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: \"Frankly, no.\" Biographer Jackson Benson notes, \"[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value.\" In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:\n\nFifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a \"compromise choice\" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen. The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot. \"There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation,\" wrote committee member Henry Olsson. Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work was behind him by 1962, committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his novel \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" showed that \"after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.\"\n\nAlthough modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist Al Capp, creator of the satirical \"Li'l Abner\", \"possibly the best writer in the world today.\" At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: \"Hemingway's short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote.\"\n\nIn September 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Steinbeck the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn 1967, at the behest of \"Newsday\" magazine, Steinbeck went to Vietnam to report on the war. He thought of the Vietnam War as a heroic venture and was considered a hawk for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield. At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a firebase while his son and other members of his platoon slept.\n\nIn May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in August. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts' death in deep depression.\n\nIn June 1949, Steinbeck met stage-manager Elaine Scott at a restaurant in Carmel, California. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship and in December 1950 Steinbeck and Scott married, within a week of the finalizing of Scott's own divorce from actor Zachary Scott. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.\n\nIn 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist Jack Rudloe, who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Florida. Their correspondence continued until Steinbeck's death.\n\nIn 1966, Steinbeck traveled to Tel Aviv to visit the site of Mount Hope, a farm community established in Israel by his grandfather, whose brother, Friedrich Großsteinbeck, was murdered by Arab marauders in 1858 in what became known as the Outrages at Jaffa.\n\nJohn Steinbeck died in New York City on December 20, 1968, of heart disease and congestive heart failure. He was 66, and had been a lifelong smoker. An autopsy showed nearly complete occlusion of the main coronary arteries.\n\nIn accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and interred on March 4, 1969 at the Hamilton family gravesite in Salinas, with those of his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was buried in the plot in 2004. He had written to his doctor that he felt deeply \"in his flesh\" that he would not survive his physical death, and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it.\n\nThe day after Steinbeck's death in New York City, reviewer Charles Poore wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"John Steinbeck's first great book was his last great book. But Good Lord, what a book that was and is: \"The Grapes of Wrath\".\" Poore noted a \"preachiness\" in Steinbeck's work, \"as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of Mark Twain—and the other half from the worst of Cotton Mather.\" But he asserted that \"Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel Prize—the Nobel judges needed him.\"\n\nSteinbeck's incomplete novel based on the King Arthur legends of Malory and others, \"The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights\", was published in 1976.\n\nMany of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, \"Of Mice and Men\" is one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that \"Of Mice and Men\" was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools. Contrariwise, Steinbeck's works have been frequently banned in the United States. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was banned by school boards: in August 1939, Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two different occasions. In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with \"Of Mice and Men\" ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.\n\nSteinbeck grew up in California's Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place.\nSalinas, Monterey and parts of the San Joaquin Valley were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as \"Steinbeck Country\". Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, \"\", which concerns the pirate Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.\n\nIn his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, Max Wagner, a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for \"The Red Pony\". Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.\n\nHis later work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history and mythology. One of his last published works was \"Travels with Charley\", a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America.\n\nSteinbeck's boyhood home, a turreted Victorian building in downtown Salinas, has been preserved and restored by the Valley Guild, a nonprofit organization. Fixed menu lunches are served Monday through Saturday, and the house is open for tours on Sunday afternoons during the summer.\n\nThe National Steinbeck Center, two blocks away at 1 Main Street is the only museum in the U.S. dedicated to a single author. Dana Gioia (chair of the National Endowment for the Arts) told an audience at the center, \"This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I've seen them all.\" Its \"Steinbeckiana\" includes \"Rocinante\", the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in \"Travels with Charley\".\n\nHis father's cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.\n\nIn Monterey, Ed Ricketts' laboratory survives (though it is not yet open to the public) and at the corner which Steinbeck describes in \"Cannery Row\", also the store which once belonged to Lee Chong, and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hobos of Cannery Row. The site of the \"Hovden Sardine Cannery\" next to Doc's laboratory is now occupied by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. In 1958 the street that Steinbeck described as \"Cannery Row\" in the novel, once named \"Ocean View Avenue\", was renamed \"Cannery Row\" in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck's work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from \"Cannery Row\", historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.\n\nOn February 27, 1979 (the 77th anniversary of the writer's birth), the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck, starting the Postal Service's Literary Arts series honoring American writers.\n\nSteinbeck was inducted in to the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Steinbeck into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. His son, author Thomas Steinbeck, accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nTo commemorate the 112th anniversary of Mr. Steinbeck's birthday on February 27, 2014, Google displayed an interactive doodle utilizing animation which included illustrations portraying scenes and quotes from several novels by the author.\n\nSteinbeck and his friend Ed Ricketts appear as a fictionalized characters in the 2016 novel, \"Monterey Bay\" about the founding of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, by Lindsay Hatton (Penguin Press).\n\nSteinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul's Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to Episcopalianism. Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the Bible and the theology of Anglicanism, combining elements of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.\n\nSteinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.\n\nSteinbeck's contacts with leftist authors, journalists, and labor union figures may have influenced his writing. He joined the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, in 1935. Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter. Through Francis Whitaker, a member of the Communist Party USA's John Reed Club for writers, Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the Cannery and Agricultural Workers' Industrial Union. In 1939, he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Soviet-established puppet government.\n\nDocuments released by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, Walter Bedell Smith, was eager to take him up on the offer. What work, if any, Steinbeck may have performed for the CIA during the Cold War is unknown.\n\nSteinbeck was a close associate of playwright Arthur Miller. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the House Un-American Activities Committee trials. Steinbeck called the period one of the \"strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced.\"\n\nIn 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the war, his sympathetic portrayal of the United States Army led the \"New York Post\" to denounce him for betraying his liberal past. Steinbeck's biographer, Jay Parini, says Steinbeck's friendship with President Lyndon B. Johnson influenced his views on Vietnam. Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam.\n\nSteinbeck complained publicly about government harassment. Thomas Steinbeck, the author's eldest son, said that J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to audit Steinbeck's taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who \"without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo.\"\n\nIn a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, John Steinbeck wrote: \"Do you suppose you could ask Edgar's boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome.\" The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation.\n\nIn 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dustbowl trilogy, which included \"Of Mice and Men\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\". This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of \"the Party,\" generally taken to be the Communist Party, although this is never spelled out in the book.\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" is a tragedy that was written as a play in 1937. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"East of Eden\", and \"The Pearl\", \"Of Mice and Men\" is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, in 1939 starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field, in 1982 starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley, and in 1992 starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.\n\nThe \"Grapes of Wrath\" is set in the Great Depression and describes a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the Dust Bowl. The title is a reference to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers' plight and too critical of capitalism, but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a film starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell and directed by John Ford.\n\nSteinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons – based on Steinbeck's own maternal ancestry – and the Trasks, reprising stories about the Biblical Adam and his progeny. The book was published in 1952. It was made into a 1955 movie directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean.\n\nIn 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built camper top – which was rare at the time – and drove across the United States with his faithful 'blue' standard poodle, Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck \"Rocinante\" after Don Quixote's \"noble steed\". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees from Maine to Montana to California, and from there to Texas and Louisiana and back to his home on Long Island. The restored camper truck is on exhibit in the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.\n\n! Title\n! Year\n! Category\n!

{"id": "15826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15826", "title": "Joshua Reynolds", "text": "Joshua Reynolds\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds (16 July 1723 – 23 February 1792) was an English painter, specialising in portraits. John Russell said he was one of the major European painters of the 18th century. He promoted the \"Grand Style\" in painting which depended on idealization of the imperfect. He was a founder and first president of the Royal Academy of Arts, and was knighted by George III in 1769.\n\nReynolds was born in Plympton, Devon, on 16 July 1723 the third son of the Rev. Samuel Reynolds, master of the Plympton Free Grammar School in the town. His father had been a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, but did not send any of his sons to the university.\nOne of his sisters was Mary Palmer (1716–1794), seven years his senior, author of \"Devonshire Dialogue\", whose fondness for drawing is said to have had much influence on him when a boy. In 1740 she provided £60, half of the premium paid to Thomas Hudson the portrait-painter, for Joshua's pupilage, and nine years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy. His other siblings included Frances Reynolds and Elizabeth Johnson.\n\nAs a boy, he came under the influence of Zachariah Mudge, whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life. Reynolds made extracts in his commonplace book from Theophrastus, Plutarch, Seneca, Marcus Antonius, Ovid, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, John Dryden, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, Aphra Behn, and passages on art theory by Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy, and André Félibien. The work that came to have the most influential impact on Reynolds was Jonathan Richardson's \"An Essay on the Theory of Painting\" (1715). Reynolds' annotated copy was lost for nearly two hundred years until it appeared in a Cambridge bookshop, inscribed with the signature ‘J. Reynolds Pictor’, and is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.\n\nHaving shown an early interest in art, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter Thomas Hudson, who had been born in Devon. Hudson had a collection of Old Master drawings, including some by Guercino, of which Reynolds made copies. Although apprenticed to Hudson for four years, Reynolds remained with him only until summer 1743. Having left Hudson, Reynolds worked for some time as a portrait-painter in Plymouth Dock (now Devonport). He returned to London before the end of 1744, but following his father's death in late 1745 he shared a house in Plymouth Dock with his sisters.\n\nIn 1749, Reynolds met Commodore Augustus Keppel, who invited him to join HMS \"Centurion\", of which he had command, on a voyage to the Mediterranean. While with the ship he visited Lisbon, Cadiz, Algiers, and Minorca. From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy, and then to Rome, where he spent two years, studying the Old Masters and acquiring a taste for the \"Grand Style\". Lord Edgcumbe, who had known Reynolds as a boy and introduced him to Keppel, suggested he should study with Pompeo Batoni, the leading painter in Rome, but Reynolds replied that he had nothing to learn from him. While in Rome he suffered a severe cold, which left him partially deaf, and, as a result, he began to carry a small ear trumpet with which he is often pictured.\n\nReynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence, Bologna, Venice, and Paris. He was accompanied by Giuseppe Marchi, then aged about 17. Apart from a brief interlude in 1770, Marchi remained in Reynolds' employment as a studio assistant for the rest of the artist's career. Following his arrival in England in October 1752, Reynolds spent three months in Devon, before establishing himself in London, where he remained for the rest of his life. He took rooms in St Martin's Lane, before moving to Great Newport Street, his sister Frances acted as his housekeeper. He achieved success rapidly, and was extremely prolific. Lord Edgecumbe recommended the Duke of Devonshire and Duke of Grafton to sit for him, and other peers followed, including the Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II, in whose portrait, according to Nicholas Penny \"bulk is brilliantly converted into power\". In 1760 Reynolds moved into a large house, with space to show his works and accommodate his assistants, on the west side of Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square).\n\nAlongside ambitious full-length portraits, Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works. In the late 1750s, at the height of the social season, he received five or six sitters a day, each for an hour. By 1761 Reynolds could command a fee of 80 guineas for a full-length portrait; in 1764 he was paid 100 guineas for a portrait of Lord Burghersh.\n\nThe clothing of Reynolds' sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils, his studio assistant Giuseppe Marchi, or the specialist drapery painter Peter Toms. James Northcote, his pupil, wrote of this arrangement that \"the imitation of particular stuffs is not the work of genius, but is to be acquired easily by practice, and this was what his pupils could do by care and time more than he himself chose to bestow; but his own slight and masterly work was still the best.\" Lay figures were used to model the clothes.\nReynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists, a practice mocked by Nathaniel Hone in a painting called \"The Conjuror\" submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775, and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. It shows a figure representing, though not resembling, Reynolds, seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety.\n\nAlthough not known principally for his landscapes, Reynolds did paint in this genre. He had an excellent vantage from his house, Wick House, on Richmond Hill, and painted the view in about 1780.\nReynolds also was recognized for his portraits of children. He emphasized the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them. His 1788 portrait, \"Age of Innocence\", is his best known character study of a child. The subject of the painting is not known, although conjecture includes Theophila Gwatkin, his great niece, and Lady Anne Spencer, the youngest daughter of the fourth Duke of Marlborough.\n\nReynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London's intelligentsia, numbered amongst whom were Dr Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, Giuseppe Baretti, Henry Thrale, David Garrick, and artist Angelica Kauffman. Johnson said in 1778: \"Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the \"Fox star\" and the \"Irish constellation\" [meaning Burke]. He is always under some planet\".\n\nBecause of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of \"The\" Club. It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, Bennet Langton, Topham Beauclerk, Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, Thomas Hawkins, and Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, Boswell, and Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.\n\nReynolds was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society of Arts, helped found the Society of Artists of Great Britain, and in 1768 became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts, a position he was to hold until his death. In 1769, he was knighted by George III, only the second artist to be so honored. His \"Discourses\", a series of lectures delivered at the Academy between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture he expressed the opinion that \"invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory.\" William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds ' there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others, and general taste and discernment'.\n\nReynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic \"Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses\" in 1808. J. M. W. Turner and James Northcote were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil, wrote to his family \"I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him.\"\n\nThe Royal Academy of Art in London celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2018, since their opening in 1768. This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate \"the making, debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy\". Waddedson manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds's influence at the academy, acknowledging how:\n\n[He] transformed British painting with portraits and subject pictures that engaged their audience's knowledge, imagination, memory and emotions... As an eloquent teacher and art theorist, he used his role at the head of the Royal Academy to raise the status of art and artists of Britain. \n\nIn the Battle of Ushant against the French in 1778, Lord Keppel commanded the Channel Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir Hugh Palliser, who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779 Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland to paint a portrait of Keppel but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the painting by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial: \"In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour\".\n\nOn 10 August 1784 Allan Ramsay died and the office of Principal Painter in Ordinary to King George III became vacant. Gainsborough felt that he had a good chance of securing it, but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it. Reynolds noted in his pocket book: \"Sept. 1, 2½, to attend at the Lord Chancellor's Office to be sworn in painter to the King\". It did not make Reynolds happy, however, as he wrote to Boswell: \"If I had known what a shabby miserable place it is, I would not have asked for it; besides as things have turned out I think a certain person is not worth speaking to, nor speaking of\", presumably meaning the king. Reynolds wrote to Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St Asaph, a few weeks later: \"Your Lordship congratulation on my succeeding Mr. Ramsay I take very kindly, but it is a most miserable office, it is reduced from two hundred to thirty-eight pounds per annum, the Kings Rat catcher I believe is a better place, and I am to be paid only a fourth part of what I have from other people, so that the Portraits of their Majesties are not likely to be better done now, than they used to be, I should be ruined if I was to paint them myself\".\n\nIn 1787 Reynolds painted the portrait of Lord Heathfield, who became a national hero for the successful defence of Gibraltar in the Great Siege from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain. Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke, wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock, its chain wrapped twice around his right hand. John Constable said in the 1830s that it was \"almost a history of the defence of Gibraltar\". Desmond Shawe-Taylor has claimed that the portrait may have a religious meaning, Heathfield holding the key similar to St. Peter (Jesus' \"rock\") possessing the keys to Heaven, Heathfield \"the rock upon which Britannia builds her military interests\".\n\nIn 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 James Boswell dedicated his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" to Reynolds. Reynolds agreed with Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the \"ancien régime\" of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it, to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it – They neglected Trade & substantial Manufacture ... but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all. When attending a dinner at Holland House, Fox's niece Caroline was sat next to Reynolds and \"burst out into glorification of the Revolution – and was grievously chilled and checked by her neighbour's cautious and unsympathetic tone\".\n\nOn 4 June 1791 at a dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern to mark the king's birthday, Reynolds drank to the toasts \"GOD \"save the\" KING!\" and \"May our glorious Constitution under which the arts flourish, be immortal!\", in what was reported by the \"Public Advertiser\" as \"a fervour truly patriotick\". Reynolds \"filled the chair with a most convivial glee\". He returned to town from Burke's house in Beaconsfield and Edmond Malone wrote that \"we left his carriage at the Inn at Hayes, and walked five miles on the road, in a warm day, without his complaining of any fatigue\".\n\nLater that month Reynolds suffered from a swelling over his left eye and had to be purged by a surgeon. In October he was too ill to take the president's chair and in November Fanny Burney recorded that I had long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had intimidated me from making the attempt\": \"He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded with a green half-bonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though extremely kind. 'I am very glad,' he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, 'to see you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I have only one eye now, and hardly that.' I was really quite touched. On 5 November Reynolds, fearing he might not have an opportunity to write a will, wrote a memorandum intended to be his last will and testament, with Edmund Burke, Edmond Malone, and Philip Metcalfe named as executors. On 10 November Reynolds wrote to Benjamin West to resign the presidency, but the General Assembly agreed he should be re-elected, with Sir William Chambers and West to deputise for him.\n\nDoctors Richard Warren and Sir George Baker believed Reynolds' illness to be psychological and they bled his neck \"with a view of drawing the humour from his eyes\" but the effect, in the view of his niece, was that it seemed \"as if the 'principle of life' were gone\" from Reynolds. On New Year's Day 1792 Reynolds became \"seized with sickness\" and from that point could not keep down food.\nReynolds died on 23 February 1792 at his house in Leicester Fields in London between eight and nine in the evening.\n\nBurke was present on the night Reynolds died, and was moved within hours to write a eulogy of Reynolds starting with the following sentiments: \"Sir Joshua Reynolds was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his Time. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant Arts to the other Glories of his Country. In Taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richness and Harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned Ages.\" Burke's tribute was well received and one journalist called it \"the eulogium of Apelles pronounced by Pericles\".\n\nReynolds was buried at St Paul's Cathedral. In 1903, a statue, by Alfred Drury, was erected in his honour in Annenberg Courtyard of Burlington House, home of the Royal Academy. Around the statue are fountains and lights, installed in 2000, arranged in the pattern of a star chart at midnight on the night of Reynolds' birth. The planets are marked by granite discs, and the Moon by a water recess. \n\nIn appearance Reynolds was not striking. Slight, he was about 5'6\" with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that James Boswell thought were \"rather too largely and strongly limned.\" He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man. Edmond Malone asserted that \"his appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred English gentleman.\"\n\nIn his mature years he suffered from deafness, as recorded by Fanny Burney, although this did not impede his lively social life (he used an ear trumpet).\n\nRenowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he \"hated nobody\". Never quite losing his Devonshire accent, he was not only an amiable and original conversationalist, but a friendly and generous host, so that Fanny Burney recorded in her diary that he had \"a suavity of disposition that set everybody at their ease in his society\", and William Makepeace Thackeray believed \"of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was the finest gentleman.\" Dr. Johnson commented on the \"inoffensiveness\" of his nature; Edmund Burke noted his \"strong turn for humor\". Thomas Bernard, who later became Bishop of Killaloe, wrote in his closing verses on Reynolds stating:\n<poem>Thou say'st not only skill is gained\nBut genius too may be attained\nBy studious imitation;\nThy temper mild, thy genius fine\nI'll copy till I make them mine\nBy constant application.</poem>\n\nSome, such as Hester Lynch Piozzi, construed Reynolds' equable calm as cool and unfeeling.\n\nIt is to this lukewarm temperament that Frederick W. Hilles, Bodman Professor of English Literature at Yale attributes Reynolds' never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium \"Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds\", Hilles theorizes that \"as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love\", and cites Boswell's notary papers: \"He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been glad he did not marry her.\" Reynolds' own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him \"a gloomy tyrant\". The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend Bennet Langton, that both his sister and niece were away from home \"so that I am quite a bachelor\". \n\nBiographer Ian McIntyre discusses the possibility of Reynolds having enjoyed sexual rendezvous with certain clients, such as Nelly O'Brien (or \"My Lady O'Brien\", as he playfully dubbed her) and Kitty Fisher, who visited his house for more sittings than were strictly necessary. Dan Cruickshank in his book \"London's Sinful Secret\" summarized Reynolds as having visited and re-visited various reputed red light districts in London after his return from Italy as a possible contributor to his medical condition and appearance due to commonly contracted disease in those areas of London.\n\nBULLET::::- English art\nBULLET::::- Grand manner\nBULLET::::- Mary Nesbitt, eighteenth-century courtesan who began her career as Reynolds' model.\nBULLET::::- Martin Postle, an expert on Joshua Reynolds\n\nBULLET::::- James Boswell, \"Life of Johnson\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008).\nBULLET::::- Charles Robert Leslie and Tom Taylor, \"Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds\" (London: John Murray, 1865, 2 volumes).\nBULLET::::- Ian McIntyre, \"Joshua Reynolds.

{"id": "15827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15827", "title": "Joseph Schumpeter", "text": "Joseph Schumpeter\n\nJoseph Aloïs Schumpeter (; 8 February 1883 – 8 January 1950) was an Austrian political economist. He was born in Moravia, and briefly served as Finance Minister of Austria in 1919. In 1932, he became a professor at Harvard University where he remained until the end of his career, eventually obtaining U.S. citizenship.\n\nSchumpeter was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century, and popularized the term \"creative destruction\" in economics.\n\nSchumpeter was born in Triesch, Habsburg Moravia (now Třešť in the Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary) in 1883 to Catholic German-speaking parents. Both of his grandmothers were Czech. Schumpeter did not acknowledge his Czech ancestry; he considered himself an ethnic German. His father owned a factory, but he died when Joseph was only four years old. In 1893, Joseph and his mother moved to Vienna. Schumpeter was a loyal supporter of Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nAfter attending school at the Theresianum, Schumpeter began his career studying law at the University of Vienna under the Austrian capital theorist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, taking his PhD in 1906. In 1909, after some study trips, he became a professor of economics and government at the University of Czernowitz. In 1911, he joined the University of Graz, where he remained until World War I.\n\nIn 1918, Schumpeter was a member of the Socialization Commission established by the Council of the People's Deputies in Germany. In March 1919, he was invited to take office as Minister of Finance in the Republic of German-Austria. He proposed a capital levy as a way to tackle the war debt and opposed the socialization of the Alpine Mountain plant. In 1921, he became president of the private Biedermann Bank. He was also a board member at the Kaufmann Bank. Problems at those banks left Schumpeter in debt. His resignation was a condition of the takeover of the Biedermann Bank in September 1924.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1932, Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn, Germany. He lectured at Harvard in 1927–1928 and 1930. In 1931, he was a visiting professor at The Tokyo College of Commerce. In 1932, Schumpeter moved to the United States, and soon began what would become extensive efforts to help central European economist colleagues displaced by Nazism. Schumpeter also became known for his opposition to Marxism and socialism that he thought would lead to dictatorship, and even criticized President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. In 1939, Schumpeter became a US citizen. In the beginning of World War II, the FBI investigated him and his wife, Elizabeth Boody (a prominent scholar of Japanese economics) for pro-Nazi leanings, but found no evidence of Nazi sympathies.\n\nAt Harvard, Schumpeter was considered a memorable character, erudite and even showy in the classroom. He became known for his heavy teaching load and his personal and painstaking interest in his students. He served as the faculty advisor of the Graduate Economics Club and organized private seminars and discussion groups. Some colleagues thought his views outdated by Keynesianism which was fashionable; others resented his criticisms, particularly of their failure to offer an assistant professorship to Paul Samuelson, but recanted when they thought him likely to accept a position at Yale University. This period of his life was characterized by hard work and comparatively little recognition of his massive 2-volume book \"Business Cycles.\" However, the Schumpeters persevered, and in 1942 published what became the most popular of all his works, \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\", reprinted many times and in many languages in the following decades, as well as cited thousands of times.\n\nThe source of Joseph Schumpeter's dynamic, change-oriented, and innovation-based economics was the Historical School of economics. Although his writings could be critical of the School, Schumpeter's work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship can be seen as a continuation of ideas originated by the Historical School, especially the work of Gustav von Schmoller and Werner Sombart.\n\nAccording to Christopher Freeman (2009), a scholar who devoted much time researching Schumpeter's work: \"the central point of his whole life work [is]: that capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and 'creative destruction'\".\n\nSchumpeter's scholarship is apparent in his posthumous \"History of Economic Analysis\", although some of his judgments seem idiosyncratic and sometimes cavalier. For instance, Schumpeter thought that the greatest 18th century economist was Turgot, not Adam Smith, as many consider, and he considered Léon Walras to be the \"greatest of all economists\", beside whom other economists' theories were \"like inadequate attempts to catch some particular aspects of Walrasian truth\". Schumpeter criticized John Maynard Keynes and David Ricardo for the \"Ricardian vice.\" According to Schumpeter, Ricardo and Keynes reasoned in terms of abstract models, where they would freeze all but a few variables. Then they could argue that one caused the other in a simple monotonic fashion. This led to the belief that one could easily deduce policy conclusions directly from a highly abstract theoretical model.\n\nIn this book, Joseph Schumpeter recognized the implication of a gold monetary standard compared to a fiat monetary standard. In \"History of Economic Analysis\", Schumpeter stated the following: \"An 'automatic' gold currency is part and parcel of a laissez-faire and free-trade economy. It links every nation's money rates and price levels with the money-rates and price levels of all the other nations that are 'on gold.' However, gold is extremely sensitive to government expenditure and even to attitudes or policies that do not involve expenditure directly, for example, to foreign policy, to certain policies of taxation, and, in general, to precisely all those policies that violate the principles of [classical] liberalism. \"This\" is the reason why gold is so unpopular now and also why it was so popular in a bourgeois era.\"\n\nSchumpeter's relationships with the ideas of other economists were quite complex in his most important contributions to economic analysis – the theory of business cycles and development. Following neither Walras nor Keynes, Schumpeter starts in \"The Theory of Economic Development\" with a treatise of circular flow which, excluding any innovations and innovative activities, leads to a stationary state. The stationary state is, according to Schumpeter, described by Walrasian equilibrium. The hero of his story is the entrepreneur.\n\nThe entrepreneur disturbs this equilibrium and is the prime cause of economic development, which proceeds in cyclic fashion along several time scales. In fashioning this theory connecting innovations, cycles, and development, Schumpeter kept alive the Russian Nikolai Kondratiev's ideas on 50-year cycles, Kondratiev waves.\n\nSchumpeter suggested a model in which the four main cycles, Kondratiev (54 years), Kuznets (18 years), Juglar (9 years) and Kitchin (about 4 years) can be added together to form a composite waveform. Actually there was considerable professional rivalry between Schumpeter and Kuznets. The wave form suggested here did not include the Kuznets Cycle simply because Schumpeter did not recognize it as a valid cycle. See \"business cycle\" for further information. A Kondratiev wave could consist of three lower degree Kuznets waves. Each Kuznets wave could, itself, be made up of two Juglar waves. Similarly two (or three) Kitchin waves could form a higher degree Juglar wave. If each of these were in phase, more importantly if the downward arc of each was simultaneous so that the nadir of each was coincident, it would explain disastrous slumps and consequent depressions. As far as the segmentation of the Kondratiev Wave, Schumpeter never proposed such a fixed model. He saw these cycles varying in time – although in a tight time frame by coincidence – and for each to serve a specific purpose.\n\nIn Schumpeter's theory, Walrasian equilibrium is not adequate to capture the key mechanisms of economic development. Schumpeter also thought that the institution enabling the entrepreneur to buy the resources needed to realize his vision was a well-developed capitalist financial system, including a whole range of institutions for granting credit. One could divide economists among (1) those who emphasized \"real\" analysis and regarded money as merely a \"veil\" and (2) those who thought monetary institutions are important and money could be a separate driving force. Both Schumpeter and Keynes were among the latter.\n\nSchumpeter's most popular book in English is probably \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\". While he agrees with Karl Marx that capitalism will collapse and be replaced by socialism, Schumpeter predicts a different way this will come about. While Marx predicted that capitalism would be overthrown by a violent proletarian revolution, which actually occurred in the least capitalist countries, Schumpeter believed that capitalism would gradually weaken by itself and eventually collapse. Specifically, the success of capitalism would lead to corporatism and to values hostile to capitalism, especially among intellectuals.\n\n\"Intellectuals\" are a social class in a position to critique societal matters for which they are not directly responsible and to stand up for the interests of other classes. Intellectuals tend to have a negative outlook of capitalism, even while relying on it for prestige, because their professions rely on antagonism toward it. The growing number of people with higher education is a great advantage of capitalism, according to Schumpeter. Yet, unemployment and a lack of fulfilling work will cause intellectual critique, discontent and protests.\n\nParliaments will increasingly elect social democratic parties, and democratic majorities will vote for restrictions on entrepreneurship. Increasing workers' self-management, industrial democracy and regulatory institutions would evolve non-politically into \"liberal capitalism\". Thus, the intellectual and social climate needed for thriving entrepreneurship will be replaced by some form of \"laborism\". This will exacerbate \"creative destruction\" (a borrowed phrase to denote an endogenous replacement of old ways of doing things by new ways), which will ultimately undermine and destroy the capitalist structure.\n\nSchumpeter emphasizes throughout this book that he is analyzing trends, not engaging in political advocacy.\n\nWilliam Fellner, in the book \"Schumpeter’s Vision: Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy After 40 Years\", noted that Schumpeter saw any political system in which the power was fully monopolized as fascist.\n\nIn the same book, Schumpeter expounded a theory of democracy which sought to challenge what he called the \"classical doctrine\". He disputed the idea that democracy was a process by which the electorate identified the common good, and politicians carried this out for them. He argued this was unrealistic, and that people's ignorance and superficiality meant that in fact they were largely manipulated by politicians, who set the agenda. Furthermore, he claimed that even if the common good was possible to find, it would still not make clear the means needed to reach its end, since citizens do not have the requisite knowledge to design government policy. This made a 'rule by the people' concept both unlikely and undesirable. Instead he advocated a minimalist model, much influenced by Max Weber, whereby democracy is the mechanism for competition between leaders, much like a market structure. Although periodic votes by the general public legitimize governments and keep them accountable, the policy program is very much seen as their own and not that of the people, and the participatory role for individuals is usually severely limited.\n\nSchumpeter defined democracy as the method by which people elected representatives in competitive elections to carry out their will. This definition has been described as simple, elegant and parsimonious, making it clearer to distinguish political systems that either fulfill or fail these characteristics. This minimalist definition stands in contrast to broader definitions of democracy, which may emphasize aspects such as \"representation, accountability, equality, participation, justice, dignity, rationality, security, freedom.\" Within such a minimalist definition, states which other scholars say have experienced democratic backsliding and which lack civil liberties, a free press, the rule of law and a constrained executive, would still be considered democracies. For Schumpeter, the formation of a government is the endpoint of the democratic process, which means that for the purposes of his democratic theory, he has no comment on what kinds of decisions that the government can take in order to be a democracy. Schumpeter faced pushback on his theory from other democratic theorists, such as Robert Dahl, who argued that there is more to democracy than simply the formation of government through competitive elections.\n\nSchumpeter's view of democracy has been described as \"elitist\", as he criticizes the rationality and knowledge of voters, and expresses a preference for politicians taking decisions. Democracy is therefore in a sense a means to ensure circulation among elites. However, studies by Natasha Piano (of the University of Chicago) emphasize that Schumpeter had substantial disdain for elites.\n\nSchumpeter was probably the first scholar to theorize about entrepreneurship, and the field owed much to his contributions. His fundamental theories are often referred to as Mark I and Mark II. In Mark I, Schumpeter argued that the innovation and technological change of a nation come from the entrepreneurs, or wild spirits. He coined the word \"Unternehmergeist\", German for \"entrepreneur-spirit\", and asserted that \"... the doing of new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way\" stemmed directly from the efforts of entrepreneurs.\n\nSchumpeter developed Mark II while a professor at Harvard. Many social economists and popular authors of the day argued that large businesses had a negative effect on the standard of living of ordinary people. Contrary to this prevailing opinion, Schumpeter argued that the agents that drive innovation and the economy are large companies which have the capital to invest in research and development of new products and services and to deliver them to customers more cheaply, thus raising their standard of living. In one of his seminal works, \"Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy\", Schumpeter wrote:\n\nSchumpeter was the most influential thinker to argue that long cycles are caused by innovation, and are an incident of it. His treatise on business cycles developed were based on Kondratiev's ideas which attributed the causes very differently. Schumpeter's treatise brought Kondratiev's ideas to the attention of English-speaking economists. Kondratiev fused important elements that Schumpeter missed. Yet, the Schumpeterian variant of long-cycles hypothesis, stressing the initiating role of innovations, commands the widest attention today.\nIn Schumpeter's view, technological innovation is at the cause of both cyclical instability and economic growth. Fluctuations in innovation cause fluctuation in investment and those cause cycles in economic growth. Schumpeter sees innovations as clustering around certain points in time periods that he refers to as \"neighborhoods of equilibrium\", when entrepreneurs perceive that risk and returns warrant innovative commitments. These clusters lead to long cycles by generating periods of acceleration in aggregate growth.\n\nThe technological view of change needs to demonstrate that changes in the rate of innovation governs changes in the rate of new investments, and that the combined impact of innovation clusters takes the form of fluctuation in aggregate output or employment. The process of technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among a set of key variables: inventions, innovations, diffusion paths and investment activities. The impact of technological innovation on aggregate output is mediated through a succession of relationships that have yet to be explored systematically in the context of long wave. New inventions are typically primitive, their performance is usually poorer than existing technologies and the cost of their production is high. A production technology may not yet exist, as is often the case in major chemical inventions, pharmaceutical inventions. The speed with which inventions are transformed into innovations and diffused depends on actual and expected trajectory of performance improvement and cost reduction.\n\nSchumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of economic change. He argued that economic change revolves around innovation, entrepreneurial activities, and market power. He sought to prove that innovation-originated market power can provide better results than the invisible hand and price competition. He argued that technological innovation often creates temporary monopolies, allowing abnormal profits that would soon be competed away by rivals and imitators. These temporary monopolies were necessary to provide the incentive for firms to develop new products and processes.\n\nHe was married three times. His first wife was Gladys Ricarde Seaver, an Englishwoman nearly 12 years his senior (married 1907, separated 1913, divorced 1925). His best man at his wedding was his friend and Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen. His second was Anna Reisinger, 20 years his junior and daughter of the concierge of the apartment where he grew up. As a divorced man, he and his bride converted to Lutheranism in order to marry. They married in 1925, but within a year, she died in childbirth. The loss of his wife and newborn son came only weeks after Schumpeter's mother had died. In 1937, Schumpeter married the American economic historian Elizabeth Boody, who helped him popularize his work and edited what became their magnum opus, the posthumously published \"History of Economic Analysis\".\n\nSchumpeter claimed that he had set himself three goals in life: to be the greatest economist in the world, to be the best horseman in all of Austria and the greatest lover in all of Vienna. He said he had reached two of his goals, but he never said which two, although he is reported to have said that there were too many fine horsemen in Austria for him to succeed in all his aspirations.\n\nSchumpeter died in his home in Taconic, Connecticut, at the age of 66, on the night of 7 January 1950.\n\nFor some time after his death, Schumpeter's views were most influential among various heterodox economists, especially European, who were interested in industrial organization, evolutionary theory, and economic development, and who tended to be on the other end of the political spectrum from Schumpeter and were also often influenced by Keynes, Karl Marx, and Thorstein Veblen. Robert Heilbroner was one of Schumpeter's most renowned pupils, who wrote extensively about him in \"The Worldly Philosophers\". In the journal \"Monthly Review\" John Bellamy Foster wrote of that journal's founder Paul Sweezy, one of the leading Marxist economists in the United States and a graduate assistant of Schumpeter's at Harvard, that Schumpeter \"played a formative role in his development as a thinker\". Other outstanding students of Schumpeter's include the economists Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Hyman Minsky and John Kenneth Galbraith and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. Future Nobel Laureate Robert Solow was his student at Harvard, and he expanded on Schumpeter's theory.\n\nToday, Schumpeter has a following outside standard textbook economics, in areas such as economic policy, management studies, industrial policy, and the study of innovation. Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to develop theories about entrepreneurship. For instance, the European Union's innovation program, and its main development plan, the Lisbon Strategy, are influenced by Schumpeter. The International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society awards the Schumpeter Prize.\n\nThe Schumpeter School of Business and Economics opened in October 2008 at the University of Wuppertal, Germany. According to University President Professor Lambert T. Koch, \"Schumpeter will not only be the name of the Faculty of Management and Economics, but this is also a research and teaching programme related to Joseph A. Schumpeter.\"\n\nOn 17 September 2009, \"The Economist\" inaugurated a column on business and management named \"Schumpeter.\" The publication has a history of naming columns after significant figures or symbols in the covered field, including naming its British affairs column after former editor Walter Bagehot and its European affairs column after Charlemagne. The initial Schumpeter column praised him as a \"champion of innovation and entrepreneurship\" whose writing showed an understanding of the benefits and dangers of business that proved to be far ahead of its time.\n\nBULLET::::- Pdf of preface by F.A.

{"id": "15830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15830", "title": "John Lee Hooker", "text": "John Lee Hooker\n\nJohn Lee Hooker (August 22, 1917 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie.\n\nSome of his best known songs include \"Boogie Chillen'\" (1948), \"Crawling King Snake\" (1949), \"Dimples\" (1956), \"Boom Boom\" (1962), and \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" (1966). Several of his later albums, including \"The Healer\" (1989), \"Mr. Lucky\" (1991), \"Chill Out\" (1995), and \"Don't Look Back\" (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and UK. \"The Healer\" (for the song \"I'm In The Mood\") and \"Chill Out\" (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins as well as \"Don't Look Back\", which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).\n\nHooker's date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have been suggested. Most sources give 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920. Information in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was born in 1912. In 2017, a series of events took place to celebrate the purported centenary of his birth. In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler Mississippi.\n\nIt is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, Mississippi, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near Clarksdale, in Coahoma County. He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923), a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census, William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a \"decade or so younger\" than her husband (\"Boogie Man\", p. 23), which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker's origins.\n\nThe Hooker children were homeschooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the spirituals sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).\n\nMoore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in Shreveport, Louisiana, learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of the time.\n\nAnother influence was Tony Hollins, who dated Hooker's sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of \"Crawlin' King Snake\" and \"Catfish Blues\".\n\nAt the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again. In the mid-1930s, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where he performed on Beale Street, at the New Daisy Theatre and occasionally at house parties.\n\nHe worked in factories in various cities during World War II, eventually getting a job with the Ford Motor Company in Detroit in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on Hastings Street, the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit's east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker's popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.\n\nHooker was working as janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948, when Modern Records, based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit. The single, \"Boogie Chillen', became a hit and the best-selling race record of 1949. Despite being illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting traditional blues lyrics, he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for Chess Records and Chance Records in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for De Luxe Records in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.\n\nHis early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, but instead he changed tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker's musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.\n\nFor much of this period he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker's later sessions for Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. \"Boom Boom\" (1962) and \"Dimples\", two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.\n\nBeginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual American Folk Blues Festival. His \"Dimples\" became a successful single on the UK Singles Charts in 1964, eight years after its first US release. Hooker began to perform and record with rock musicians. One of his earliest collaborations was with British blues rock band the Groundhogs. In 1970, he recorded the joint album \"Hooker 'n Heat\", with the American blues and boogie rock group Canned Heat, whose repertoire included adaptations of Hooker songs. It became the first of Hooker's albums to reach the \"Billboard\" charts, peaking at number 78 on the Billboard 200. Other collaboration albums soon followed, including \"Endless Boogie\" (1971) and \"Never Get Out of These Blues Alive\" (1972), which included Steve Miller, Elvin Bishop, Van Morrison, and others.\n\nHooker appeared in the 1980 film \"The Blues Brothers\". He performed \"Boom Boom\" in the role of a street musician. In 1989, he recorded the album \"The Healer\" with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, and others. The 1990s saw additional collaboration albums: \"Mr. Lucky\" (1991), \"Chill Out\" (1995), and \"Don't Look Back\" (1997) with Morrison, Santana, Los Lobos, and additional guest musicians. His re-recording of \"Boom Boom\" (the title track for his 1992 album) with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan became Hooker's highest charting single (number 16) in the UK. \"Come See About Me\", a 2004 DVD, includes performances filmed between 1960 and 1994 and interviews with several of the musicians.\n\nHooker owned five houses in his later life, including houses located in Los Altos, California; Redwood City, California; and Long Beach, California.\n\nHooker died in his sleep on June 21, 2001, in Los Altos, California in his home. He is interred at the Chapel of the Chimes in Oakland, California. He was survived by eight children, 19 grandchildren, and numerous great-grandchildren.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed John Lee Hooker among hundreds of artists whose recordings were reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nAmong his many awards, Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He was a recipient of a 1983 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.\n\nTwo of his songs, \"Boogie Chillen\" and \"Boom Boom\", are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. \"Boogie Chillen\" is also included in the Recording Industry Association of America's list of the \"Songs of the Century\".\n\nIn 2007, John Lee Hooker was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.\n\nBULLET::::- Best Traditional Blues Recording, 1990, for \"I'm in the Mood\", with Bonnie Raitt\nBULLET::::- Best Traditional Blues Album, 1995, for \"Chill Out\"\nBULLET::::- Best Traditional Blues Recording, 1998, for \"Don't Look Back\nBULLET::::- Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, 1998, \"Don't Look Back\", with Van Morrison\nBULLET::::- Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 2000\n\n! scope=\"col\" width=5% rowspan=\"2\"  Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=42% rowspan=\"2\"  Title\n! scope=\"col\" width=15% rowspan=\"2\"  Label \n! scope=\"col\" width=8% class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\"  Peak chartposition\n! width=5%  US 100\n! width=5%  US R&B\n! width=5%  UK Singles\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"  1948\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"  1949\n! scope=\"row\"  1950\n! scope=\"row\"  1951\n! scope=\"row\"  1958\n! scope=\"row\"  1960\n! scope=\"row\"  1962\n! scope=\"row\"  1964\n! scope=\"row\"  1992\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"  1993\n! scope=\"row\" 1995\n! scope=\"row\" 1998\n\n! scope=\"col\" width=5% rowspan=\"2\"  Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=42% rowspan=\"2\"  Title\n! scope=\"col\" width=15% rowspan=\"2\"  Label\n! scope=\"col\" width=8% class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"3\"  Peak chartposition\n! width=5%  US 200\n! width=5%  US Blues\n! width=5%  UK Albums\n! scope=\"row\"  1967\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"  1971\n! scope=\"row\"  1972\n! scope=\"row\"  1989\n! scope=\"row\"  1991\n! scope=\"row\"  1995\n! scope=\"row\"  1997\n! scope=\"row\"  1998\n! scope=\"row\"  2002\n! scope=\"row\"  2004\n! scope=\"row\"  2007\n! scope=\"row\"  2015\n\nBULLET::::- \"The Blues Brothers\" on Maxwell Street (Chicago) outside Aretha Franklin's restaurant (1980)\nBULLET::::- \"John Lee Hooker & Furry Lewis\" DVD (1995)\nBULLET::::- \"John Lee Hooker Rare Performances 1960–1984\" DVD (2002)\nBULLET::::- \"Come See About Me\" DVD (2004)\nBULLET::::- \"John Lee Hooker: Bits and Pieces About …\" DVD and CD (2006)\n\nBULLET::::- The Great R&B-files - The R&B Pioneers Series\n"}

{"id": "15834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15834", "title": "Satires (Juvenal)", "text": "Satires (Juvenal)\n\nThe Satires are a collection of satirical poems by the Latin author Juvenal written in the early 2nd century AD.\nJuvenal is credited with sixteen known poems divided among five books; all are in the Roman genre of satire, which, at its most basic in the time of the author, comprised a wide-ranging discussion of society and social \"mores\" in dactylic hexameter. The sixth and tenth satires are some of the most renowned works in the collection. The poems are not individually titled, but translators have often added titles for the convenience of readers. \n\nBULLET::::- Book I: Satires 1–5\nBULLET::::- Book II: Satire 6\nBULLET::::- Book III: Satires 7–9\nBULLET::::- Book IV: Satires 10–12\nBULLET::::- Book V: Satires 13–16 (Satire 16 is incompletely preserved)\n\nRoman \"Satura\" was a formal literary genre rather than being simply clever, humorous critique in no particular format. Juvenal wrote in this tradition, which originated with Lucilius and included the Sermones of Horace and the Satires of Persius. In a tone and manner ranging from irony to apparent rage, Juvenal criticizes the actions and beliefs of many of his contemporaries, providing insight more into value systems and questions of morality and less into the realities of Roman life. The author employs outright obscenity less frequently than Martial or Catullus, but the scenes painted in his text are no less vivid or lurid for that discretion.\n\nThe author makes constant allusion to history and myth as a source of object lessons or exemplars of particular vices and virtues. Coupled with his dense and elliptical Latin, these tangential references indicate that the intended reader of the \"Satires\" was highly educated. The \"Satires\" are concerned with perceived threats to the social continuity of the Roman citizens: social-climbing foreigners, unfaithfulness, and other more extreme excesses of their own class. The intended audience of the \"Satires\" constituted a subset of the Roman elite, primarily adult males of a more conservative social stance.\n\nScholarly estimates for the dating of the individual books have varied. It is generally accepted that the fifth book must date to a point after 127 A.D., because of a reference to the Roman consul Iuncus in Satire 15. A recent scholar has argued that the first book should be dated to 100 or 101. Juvenal's works are contemporary with those of Martial, Tacitus and Pliny the Younger.\n\nThe controversies concerning the surviving texts of the Satires have been extensive and heated. Many manuscripts survive, but only P (the Codex Pithoeanus Montepessulanus), a 9th-century manuscript based on an edition prepared in the 4th century by a pupil of Servius Honoratus, the grammarian, is reasonably reliable. At the same time as the Servian text was produced, however, other and lesser scholars also created their editions of Juvenal: it is these on which most medieval manuscripts of Juvenal are based. It did not help matters that P disappeared sometime during the Renaissance and was only rediscovered around 1840. It is not, however, uncommon for the generally inferior manuscripts to supply a better reading in cases when P is imperfect. In addition, modern scholarly debate has also raged around the authenticity of the text which has survived, as various editors have argued that considerable portions are not, in fact, authentically Juvenalian and represent interpolations from early editors of the text. Jachmann (1943) argued that up to one-third of what survives is non-authentic: Ulrick Knoche (1950) deleted about hundred lines, Clausen about forty, Courtney (1975) a similar number. Willis (1997) italicizes 297 lines as being potentially suspect. On the other hand, Vahlen, Housman, Duff, Griffith, Ferguson and Green believe the surviving text to be largely authentic: indeed Green regards the main problem as being not interpolations but lacunae.\n\nIn recent times debate has focused on the authenticity of the \"O Passage\" of Satire VI, 36 lines (34 of which are continuous) discovered by E.O. Winstedt in an 11th-century manuscript in Oxford's Bodleian Library. These lines occur in no other manuscript of Juvenal, and when discovered were considerably corrupted. Ever since Housman translated and emended the \"O Passage\" there has been considerable controversy over whether the fragment is in fact a forgery: the field is currently split between those (Green, Ferguson, Courtney) who believe it isn't, and those (Willis, Anderson), who believe it is.\n\nThis so-called \"Programmatic Satire\" lays out for the reader a catalogue of ills and annoyances that prompt the narrator to write satire. Some examples cited by Juvenal include eunuchs getting married, elite women performing in a beast hunt, and the dregs of society suddenly becoming wealthy by gross acts of sycophancy. To the extent that it is programmatic, this satire concerns the first book rather than the satires of the other four known books. The narrator explicitly marks the writings of Lucilius as the model for his book of poems (lines 19–20), although he claims that to attack the living as his model did incur great risk (lines 165–67). The narrator contends that traditional Roman virtues, such as fides and virtus, had disappeared from society to the extent that \"Rome was no longer Roman\":\n\nBULLET::::- lines 1.1–19 – Since there are so many poets wasting paper and everyone's time anyway – why not write?\nBULLET::::- lines 1.20–80 – The narrator recites a catalogue of social deviants and criminals that demand Satire be written.\nBULLET::::- lines 1.81–126 – Since the dawn of history, greed and fiscal corruption have never been worse.\nBULLET::::- lines 1.127–146 – The narrator contrasts a typical day in the life of poor clients with that of their self-indulgent patron.\nBULLET::::- lines 1.147–171 – The past cannot be worse than the present - yet one should only satirize the dead if they wish to live in safety.\n\n170 lines. The narrator claims to want to flee civilization (i.e. \"Roma\") to beyond the world's end when confronted by moral hypocrisy. Although the broad theme of this poem is the process of gender inversion, it would be an error to take it as simple invective against pathic men. Juvenal is concerned with gender deviance\n\nBULLET::::- lines 2.1–35 – Pathic men that pretend to be moral exemplars are much worse than those who are open about their proclivities.\nBULLET::::- lines 2.36–65 – When criticized for her morals, Laronia turns on one of these hypocrites and mocks their open effeminacy.\nBULLET::::- lines 2.65–81 – Criticism of the effeminate dress of Creticus as he practices law. This moral plague (\"contagiō\") spreads like disease passes through an entire herd of livestock or a bunch of grapes.\nBULLET::::- lines 2.82–116 – Effeminate dress is the gateway to complete gender inversion.\nBULLET::::- lines 2.117–148 – A noble man, Gracchus, gets married to another man – but such brides are infertile no matter what drugs they try or how much they are whipped in the Lupercalia.\nBULLET::::- lines 2.149–170 – The ghosts of great Romans of the past would feel themselves contaminated when such Romans descend to the underworld.\n\n322 lines. In the place where Numa Pompilius (the legendary second king of Rome) received a nymph's advice on creating Roman law, the narrator has a final conversation with his Roman friend Umbricius, who is emigrating to Cumae. Umbricius claims that slick and immoral foreigners have shut a real Roman out of all opportunity to prosper. Only the first 20 lines are in the voice of the narrator; the remainder of the poem is cast as the words of Umbricius.\n\nIn 1738, Samuel Johnson was inspired by this text to write his \"London: A Poem in Imitation of the Third Satire of Juvenal\". The archetypal question of whether an urban life of hectic ambition is to be preferred to a pastoral fantasy retreat to the country is posed by the narrator:\n\nBULLET::::- lines 3.1–20 – The narrator's old friend Umbricius is about to depart Roma for Cumae. The narrator says he would himself prefer Prochyta to the Suburra, and he describes the ancient shrine of Egeria being put up for rent to Jews and polluted by marble.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.21–57 – Umbricius: There is no opportunity in Roma for an honest man.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.58–125 – Umbricius: The Greeks and their ways are flowing like pollution into \"Roma\", and they are so adept at lying flattery that they are achieving more social advancement than real Romans.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.126–163 – Umbricius: The dregs of society so long as they are wealthy lord it over real Romans; there is no hope for an honest man in court if he is poor.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.164–189 – Umbricius: Virtue and lack of pretension is only to be found outside the City; at \"Roma\" everything is expensive, pretentious, and bought on credit.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.190–231 – Umbricius contrasts the perils and degradation of living in \"Roma\" with the easy and cheap life outside the City.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.232–267 – Umbricius: The streets of \"Roma\" are annoying and dangerous if you are not rich enough to ride in a litter.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.268–314 – Umbricius: Travel by night in \"Roma\" is fraught with danger from falling tiles, thugs, and robbers.\nBULLET::::- lines 3.315–322 – Umbricius takes his leave of the narrator, and promises to visit him in his native Aquinum.\n\n154 lines. The narrator makes the emperor Domitian and his court the objects of his ridicule in this mock-epic tale of a fish so prodigious that it was fit for the emperor alone. The council of state is called to deal with the crisis of how to cook it, where the fish can neither be cooked by conventional means due to its size, nor can it be cut into pieces. The main themes of this poem are the corruption and incompetence of sycophantic courtiers and the inability or unwillingness to speak truth to power.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau's motto, \"vitam impendere vero\" (to pay his life for the truth), is taken from the passage below, a description of the qualifications of an imperial courtier in the reign of Domitian:\n\nBULLET::::- lines 4.1–10 – Criticism of the courtier Crispinus.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.11–33 – Crispinus bought a mullet for six thousand sesterces – more expensive than the fisherman that caught him.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.34–56 – Mock-epic narrative of the crisis of state caused by a giant turbot begins with the catch.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.56–72 – The fisherman rushes to get the fish to the emperor.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.72–93 – Crispinus and other councilors begin to arrive.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.94–143 – More councilors arrive and one prophesizes that the fish is an omen of a future victory. The question of what to do with it is raised, and Montanus advises that a vessel be manufactured at once suitable for its size.\nBULLET::::- lines 4.144–154 – The council break up, and the narrator voices his wish that all the actions of Domitian had been so meaningless.\n\n173 lines. The narrative frame of this poem is a dinner party where many potential dysfunctions in the ideal of the patron-client relationship are put on display. Rather than being a performance of faux-equality, the patron (Virro as in 9.35) emphasizes the superiority of himself and his peers (\"amici\") over his clients (\"viles amici\") by offering food and drink of unequal quality to each. Juvenal concludes with the observation that the clients who put up with this treatment deserve it.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 5.1–11 – Begging is better than being treated disrespectfully at a patron's dinner.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.12–23 – An invitation to dinner is a social exchange for your services as a client.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.24–48 – Different wines and goblets for different social ranks.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.49–106 – Different water is served by different grades of slaves – and different breads served by arrogant slaves. The patron gets a lobster, and you get a crayfish; he gets a Corsican mullet, and you get a sewer-fish.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.107–113 – Seneca and others were known for their generosity. The elite should dine as equals with their friends – clients.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.114–124 – The patron gets a goose liver and boar meat, but you get to watch the meat carver perform.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.125–155 – If you had a fortune the patron would respect you; it is the cash that he really respects. Different mushrooms and apples.\nBULLET::::- lines 5.156–173 – Clients who will not resist this kind of treatment deserve it and worse.\n\nc. 695 lines. For the discussion and synopsis, see Satire VI.\n\n243 lines. Juvenal returns to his theme of distorted economic values among the Roman elite – in this instance centered on their unwillingness to provide appropriate support for poets, lawyers, and teachers. It is the capricious whims of fate that determine the variables of a human life.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 7.1–21 – The emperor is the only remaining patron of letters.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.22–35 – Other patrons have learned to offer their admiration only.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.36–52 – The urge to write is an addictive disease.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.53–97 – Money and leisure are required to be a really great poet (\"vatis\"); hunger and discomfort would have hobbled even Virgil.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.98–105 – Historians (\"scriptores historiarum\") do not have it any better.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.106–149 – Lawyers (\"causidici\") get only as much respect as the quality of their dress can buy.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.150–177 – No one is willing to pay teachers of rhetoric (\"magistri\") appropriately.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.178–214 – Rich men restrain only their spending on a teacher of rhetoric (\"rhetor\") for their sons. Quintilian was rich, he was the lucky exception to the rule.\nBULLET::::- lines 7.215–243 – The qualifications and efforts required of a teacher (\"grammaticus\") are totally out of proportion to their pay.\n\n275 lines. The narrator takes issue with the idea that pedigree ought to be taken as evidence of a person's worth.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 8.1–38 – What is the value of a pedigree, if you are inferior to your ancestors?\nBULLET::::- lines 8.39–55 – Many nobles have done nothing to makes themselves noble.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.56–70 – Racehorses are valued for their speed not their ancestors; if they are slow they will end up pulling a cart.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.71–86 – It is vile to rely on the reputations of others; one should be noble even in the face of danger.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.87–126 – Govern your province honestly. When everything else is stolen from those you rule, weapons and desperation remain.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.127–162 – If you live wickedly, your good ancestors are a reproach to you.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.163–182 – Bad behavior should be ceased in youth. The nobles make excuses for behavior that would not be tolerated in slaves.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.183–210 – When they bankrupt themselves, the nobles may sink to the level of the stage or the arena.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.211–230 – The emperor Nero utterly debased himself in these ways.\nBULLET::::- lines 8.231–275 – Many people without famous ancestors have served \"Roma\" with great distinction. Indeed, everyone is descended from peasants or worse if you go back far enough.\n\n150 lines. This satire is in the form of a dialogue between the narrator and Naevolus – a male prostitute, the disgruntled client of a pathic patron.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 9.1–26 – Narrator: Why do you look so haggard, Naevolus?\nBULLET::::- lines 9.27–46 – Naevolus: The life of serving the needs of pathic rich men is not paying off.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.46–47 – Nar: But you used to think you were really sexy to men.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.48–69 – Nae: Rich pathics are not willing to spend on their sickness, but I have bills to pay.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.70–90 – Nae: I saved his marriage by doing his job for him with a wife that was about to get a divorce.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.90–91 – Nar: You are justified in complaining, Naevolus. What did he say?\nBULLET::::- lines 9.92–101 – Nae: He is looking for another two-legged donkey, but don't repeat any of this, he might try to kill me.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.102–123 – Nar: Rich men have no secrets.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.124–129 – Nae: But what should I do now; youth is fleeting.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.130–134 – Nar: You will never lack a pathic patron, don't worry.\nBULLET::::- lines 9.134–150 – Nae: But I want so little. Fortuna must have her ears plugged when I pray.\n\n366 lines. The theme of this poem encompasses the myriad objects of prayer unwisely sought from the gods: wealth, power, beauty, children, long life, et cetera. The narrator argues that each of these is a false Good; each desired thing is shown to be not good in itself, but only good so long as other factors do not intervene. This satire is the source of the well-known phrase \"mens sana in corpore sano\" (a healthy mind in a healthy body), which appears in the passage above. It is also the source of the phrase \"panem et circenses\" (bread and circuses) – the only remaining cares of a Roman populace which has given up its birthright of political freedom (10.81).\n\nBULLET::::- lines 10.1–27—Few know what is really Good. Wealth often destroys.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.28–55—One can either cry like Heraclitus or laugh like Democritus at the state of things. But what should men pray for?\nBULLET::::- lines 10.56–89—It is all too easy to fall from power – like Sejanus. The mob follows Fortuna and cares for nothing but bread and circuses.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.90–113—By seeking ever more honors and power, Sejanus just made his eventual fall that much more terrible.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.114–132—Being a great orator like Demosthenes or Cicero may get one killed.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.133–146—Lust for military glory has ruined countries, and time will destroy even the graves of famous generals.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.147–167—What did Hannibal ultimately accomplish? He dies of poison in exile.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.168–187—The world was not big enough for Alexander the Great, but a coffin was. Xerxes I crawled back to Persia after his misadventure in Greece.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.188–209—Long life just means ugliness, helplessness, impotence, and the loss of all pleasure.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.209–239—Old people are deaf and full of diseases. Dementia is the worst affliction of all.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.240–272—Old people just live to see the funerals of their children and loved ones, like Nestor or Priam.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.273–288—Many men would have been thought fortunate if they had died before a late disaster overtook them: e.g. Croesus, Marius, and Pompey.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.289–309—Beauty is inimical to a person's virtue. Even if they remain untouched by corruption, it makes them objects of lust for perverts.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.310–345—Beautiful men tend to become noted adulterers, risking their lives. Even if they are unwilling like Hippolytus, the wrath of scorned women may destroy them.\nBULLET::::- lines 10.346–366—Is there nothing to pray for then? Trust the gods to choose what is best; they love humans more than we do ourselves, but if you must pray for something, \"[i]t is to be prayed that the mind be sound in a sound body...\" (the excerpt above).\n\n208 lines. The main themes of this poem are self-awareness and moderation. The poem explicitly mentions one apothegm γνῶθι σεαυτόν (know thyself) from the temple of Apollo at Delphi, while its theme calls to mind another μηδέν ἄγαν (nothing in excess). The subject, in this instance, is the role of food and the \"cena\" (formal dinner) in Roman society. The narrator contrasts the ruinous spending habits of gourmands with the moderation of a simple meal of home-grown foods in the manner of the mythical ancient Romans.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 11.1–55 – People that refuse to limit their gourmet habits, even in the face of having to do so on credit, soon endure poverty and consequently inferior food. The advice of Apollo to know thyself should be heeded – not just for ambitions and endeavors, but also for what should be spent on a fish.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.56–89 – The narrator invites a Persicus to come to his house for dinner to see whether his actions match his rhetoric. The dinner will include only home-grown foods from the narrator's Tiburtine land. Long ago, the noble Curius cooked things for himself that a slave on a chain-gang would reject now.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.90–119 – The ancient Romans did not care for luxuries and Greek art. A Jupiter made of terracotta saved the city from the Gauls.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.120–135 – Now rich people get no enjoyment from delicacies unless they eat from tables decorated with ivory. The narrator claims that his food is unharmed, despite owning no ivory.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.136–161 – The narrator promises no professional meat carver or exotic slave servers, nor are his slave boys destined for emasculation and use as sexual toys.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.162–182 – In place of a pornographic Spanish dance show, there will be poetry.\nBULLET::::- lines 11.183–208 – Rather than endure the annoyance of all Roma at the Circus Maximus during the Megalensian Games, the narrator invites his addressee to shake off his cares and come to a simple dinner.\n\n130 lines. The narrator describes to his addressee Corvinus the sacrificial vows that he has made for the salvation of his friend Catullus from shipwreck. These vows are to the primary Roman gods – Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva (the Capitoline Triad)- but other shipwrecked sailors are said to make offerings to Isis. In the passage quoted above, the narrator asserts that his sacrifices are not to curry favor or gain an inheritance, common reasons for making vows among those who would not hesitate to sacrifice their slaves or even children if it would bring them an inheritance.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 12.1–29 – Description of the sacrificial preparations.\nBULLET::::- lines 12.30–51 – Description of a storm: this friend had been willing to cast overboard items of great value to save his own life – who else would prefer his life to his treasures.\nBULLET::::- lines 12.52–82 – They had to cut the mast due to the ferocity of the storm, but then the weather calmed and they limped their ship into the port at Ostia.\nBULLET::::- lines 12.83–92 – The narrator orders that the altar and sacrifice be made ready. He says that he will propitiate his \"Lares\" (family gods) as well.\nBULLET::::- lines 12.93–130 – Catullus has heirs, so the narrator is acting as a friend not a legacy-hunter (\"captator\"). Legacy hunters would sacrifice one hundred cattle, elephants, slaves, or even their own child if it secured an inheritance for them.\n\n249 lines. This poem is a dissuasion from excessive rage and the desire for revenge when one is defrauded. The narrator recommends a philosophical moderation and the perspective that comes from realizing that there are many things worse than financial loss.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 13.1–18 – Guilt is its own punishment. One should not overreact to ill-use.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.19–70 – Philosophy and life-experience offer a defense against \"Fortuna\". There are hardly as many good people as the gates of Egyptian Thebes (100) or even as the mouths of the Nile (9). The Golden Age was infinitely superior to the present age, an age so corrupt there is not even an appropriate metal to name it.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.71–85 – Perjurers will swear on the arms of all the gods to deny their debts.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.86–119 – Some believe that everything is a product of chance, and so do not fear to perjure themselves on the altars of the gods. Others rationalize that the wrath of the gods, though great, is very slow in coming.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.120–134 – It takes no philosopher to realize that there are many worse wrongs than being defrauded. A financial loss is mourned more than a death, and it is mourned with real tears.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.135–173 – It is silly to be surprised by the number and magnitude of the crimes put to trial at \"Roma\", as silly as to be surprised by a German having blue eyes.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.174–209 – Even execution of a criminal would not undo their crime; only the uneducated think that revenge is a Good. That is not what the philosophers Chrysippos, Thales, or Socrates would say. The narrator makes an extended reference to the story of a corrupt Spartan's consultation of the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi from Herodotus (6.86). The mere intention to do evil is guilt.\nBULLET::::- lines 13.210–249 – Consciousness of one's guilt is its own punishment, with anxiety and fear of divine retribution. The \"natura\" (nature) of criminals is\" fixa\" (stuck) and \"mutari nescia\" (unable to be changed), and it rushes back to ways they have admitted are wrong (239–40). Thus, criminals tend to repeat their crimes, and eventually end up facing execution or exile.\n\n331 lines. The narrator stresses that children most readily learn all forms of vice from their parents. Avarice must actually be taught since it runs counter to nature. This vice is particularly pernicious, since it has the appearance of a virtue and is the source of a myriad of crimes and cruelties.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 14.1–37 – The greatest danger to the morals of children comes from the vices of their parents.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.38–58 – People should restrain themselves from vice for the sake of their children. It is unjust for a father to criticize and punish a son who takes after himself.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.59–85 – People are more concerned to present a clean atrium to outsiders than to keep their house free of vice for their children. The tastes acquired in childhood persist into adulthood.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.86–95 – Caetronius squandered much of his wealth by building many fine houses; his son squandered the rest by doing the same.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.96–106 – People learn to be Jewish from their parents.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.107–134 – Avarice has the appearance of a virtue, but it leads to cruel deprivation of one's slaves and one's own self.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.135–188 – It is madness to live like an indigent just to die rich. There is no amount of money or land that will satisfy greed, but ancient Romans veterans of the Punic wars or of the war against Pyrrhus were content with only two \"iugera\" (acres) of land in return for all their wounds. Impatient greed leads to crime.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.189–209 – Become a lawyer, join the army, or become a merchant. Profit smells good, wherever it's from. Nobody inquires into where you got it, but you have to have it.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.210–255 – The greedy son will surpass his father as much as Achilles did Peleus. Instilling avarice is the same as teaching a child every form of crime. A son whom you have taught to have no mercy will have no mercy on you either.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.256–283 – Those who take risks to increase their fortunes are like tightrope walkers. Fleets sail wherever there is hope of profit.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.284–302 – Avaricious men are willing to risk their lives and fortunes just to have a few more pieces of silver with someone's face and inscription on them.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.303–316 – The anxiety of protecting wealth and possessions is a misery. Alexander the Great realized that the cynic Diogenes was happier than himself while living in his pottery home, since Alexander's anxieties and dangers matched his ambitions, while Diogenes was content with what he had and could easily replace.\nBULLET::::- lines 14.316–331 – How much is enough then? As much as Epicurus or Socrates was content to possess is best, or – in the Roman manner – a fortune equal to the equestrian order. If twice or three times that does not suffice, then not even the wealth of Croesus or of Persia will suffice.\n\n174 lines. The narrator discusses the centrality of compassion for other people to the preservation of civilization. While severe circumstances have at times called for desperate measures to preserve life, even the most savage tribes have refrained from cannibalism. We were given minds to allow us to live together in mutual assistance and security. Without limits on rage against our enemies, we are worse than animals.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 15.1–26 – In Egypt they worship bizarre animal-headed gods, but not the familiar Roman ones. Similarly, they won't eat normal things, but do practice cannibalism. Ulysses must have been thought a liar for his tale of the Laestrygonians or the Cyclopes.\nBULLET::::- lines 15.27–32 – Recently in upper Egypt, an entire people was guilty of this crime.\nBULLET::::- lines 15.33–92 – Two neighboring cities hated each other. One attacked while the other held a feast. Fists gave way to stones and then to arrows; as one side fled, one man slipped and was caught. He was ripped to pieces and eaten raw.\nBULLET::::- lines 15.93–131 – The Vascones, however, were blameless, because they were compelled to cannibalism by the siege of Pompey the Great. Even at the altar of Artemis in Taurus, humans are only sacrificed, not eaten.\nBULLET::::- lines 15.131–158 – Compassion is what separates humans from animals. The creator gave humans mind (\"animus\") as well as life (\"vita\"), so that people could live together in a civil society.\n\n60 lines preserved. The primary theme of the preserved lines is the advantages of soldiers over mere citizens.\n\nBULLET::::- lines 16.1–6 – The narrator wishes that he could join the legions, since soldiers have many advantages over civilians.\nBULLET::::- lines 16.7–34 – Soldiers are immune to justice since they have to be tried in the camp among other soldiers, where a plaintiff will get no help prosecuting them, and may get a beating in addition for their trouble.\nBULLET::::- lines 16.35–50 – Soldiers do not have to wait for legal action like civilians\nBULLET::::- lines 16.51–60 – Only soldiers have the right to make a will while their father lives – leading to an inversion of power with the soldier son being above his father.\n\nBULLET::::- Anderson, William S.. 1982.

Cocteau is best known for his novels \"Le Grand Écart\" (1923), \"Le Livre Blanc\" (1928), and \"Les Enfants Terribles\" (1929); the stage plays \"La Voix Humaine\" (1930), \"La Machine Infernale\" (1934), \"Les Parents terribles\" (1938), \"La Machine à écrire\" (1941), and \"L'Aigle à deux têtes\" (1946); and the films \"The Blood of a Poet\" (1930), \"Les Parents Terribles\" (1948), from his own eponymous \"piéce\", \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Orpheus\" (1949), and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960), which alongside \"Blood of a Poet\" and \"Orpheus\" constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as \"one of [the] avant-garde's most successful and influential filmmakers\" by AllMovie.\n\nCocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, a town near Paris, to Georges Cocteau and his wife, Eugénie Lecomte; a socially prominent Parisian family. His father was a lawyer and amateur painter who committed suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900–1904, Cocteau attended the Lycée Condorcet where he met and began a physical relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos who would later reappear throughout Cocteau's oeuvre. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, \"Aladdin's Lamp\", at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as \"The Frivolous Prince\", the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man \"to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...\"\n\nIn his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, André Gide, and Maurice Barrès. In 1912, he collaborated with Léon Bakst on \"Le Dieu bleu\" for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in \"Parade\" in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. The piece was later expanded into a full opera, with music by Satie, Francis Poulenc and Maurice Ravel. \"If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,\" wrote Cocteau, \"with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.\" He denied being a Surrealist or being in any way attached to the movement. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio \"Oedipus rex\", which had its original performance in the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927.\n\nAn important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.\n\nIn 1918 he met the French poet Raymond Radiguet. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguet's great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend's works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of \"Le Diable au corps\" (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the \"Nouveau Monde\" literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship. Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.\n\nThere is disagreement over Cocteau's reaction to Radiguet's sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to opium addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of \"Les noces\" (\"The Wedding\") by the Ballets Russes at Monte Carlo. Cocteau himself much later characterised his reaction as one of \"stupor and disgust.\" His opium addiction at the time, Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the Monte Carlo Opera. Cocteau's opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, \"Les Enfants Terribles\", was written in a week during a strenuous opium weaning. In \"\", he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. Under Maritain's influence Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.\n\nCocteau's experiments with the human voice peaked with his play \"La Voix humaine\". The story involves one woman on stage speaking on the telephone with her (invisible and inaudible) departing lover, who is leaving her to marry another woman. The telephone proved to be the perfect prop for Cocteau to explore his ideas, feelings, and \"algebra\" concerning human needs and realities in communication.\n\nCocteau acknowledged in the introduction to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents. \"La Voix humaine\" was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame Berthe Bovy. Before came \"Orphée\", later turned into one of his more successful films; after came \"La Machine infernale\", arguably his most fully realized work of art. \"La Voix humaine\" is deceptively simple — a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover. It is full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists' Vox Humana experiments after World War One, Alphonse de Lamartine's \"La Voix humaine\", part of his larger work \"Harmonies poétiques et religieuses\" and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana (\"voix humaine\"), an organ stop of the Regal Class by Church organ masters (late 16th century) that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in doing better than the sound of a male chorus at a distance.\n\nReviews varied at the time and since but whatever the critique, the play represents Cocteau's state of mind and feelings towards his actors at the time: on the one hand, he wanted to spoil and please them; on the other, he was fed up with their diva antics and was ready for revenge. It is also true that none of Cocteau's works has inspired as much imitation: Francis Poulenc's opera \"La voix humaine\", Gian Carlo Menotti's \"\"opera buffa\"\" \"The Telephone\" and Roberto Rossellini's film version in Italian with Anna Magnani \"L'Amore\" (1948). There has also been a long line of interpreters including Simone Signoret, Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann (in the play) and Julia Migenes, Denise Duval, Renata Scotto, Anja Silja and Felicity Lott (in the opera).\n\nAccording to one theory about how Cocteau was inspired to write \"La Voix humaine\", he was experimenting with an idea by fellow French playwright Henri Bernstein.\n\nBiographer James S. Williams describes Cocteau's politics as \"naturally Right-leaning.\" During the Nazi occupation of France, Cocteau's friend Arno Breker convinced him that Adolf Hitler was a pacifist and patron of the arts with France's best interests in mind. In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer's sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Breker's sculptures in an article entitled 'Salut à Breker' published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts to his failed attempt to save friends such as Max Jacob.\nIn 1940, \"Le Bel Indifférent\", Cocteau's play written for and starring Édith Piaf, was enormously successful. He also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was a friend of most of the European art community. Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.\n\nCocteau is best known for his novel \"Les Enfants Terribles\" (1929), and the films \"The Blood of a Poet\" (1930), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Les Parents terribles\" (1948), and \"Orpheus\" (1949). His final film, \"Le Testament d'Orphée\" (\"The Testament of Orpheus\") (1960), featured appearances by Picasso and matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, along with Yul Brynner, who also helped finance the film.\n\nIn 1945 Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the Théâtre de la Mode. He drew inspiration from filmmaker René Clair while making \"Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch\". The maquette is described in his \"Journal 1942–1945,\" in his entry for 12 February 1945: \n\nJean Cocteau never hid his homosexuality. He was the author of the mildly homoerotic and semi-autobiographical \"Le livre blanc\" (translated as \"The White Paper\" or \"The White Book\"), published anonymously in 1928. He never repudiated its authorship and a later edition of the novel features his foreword and drawings. The novel begins:\n\nFrequently his work, either literary (\"Les enfants terribles\"), graphic (erotic drawings, book illustration, paintings) or cinematographic (\"The Blood of a Poet\", \"Orpheus\", \"Beauty and the Beast\"), is pervaded with homosexual undertones, homoerotic imagery/symbolism or outright camp. In 1947 Paul Morihien published a clandestine edition of \"Querelle de Brest\" by Jean Genet, featuring 29 very explicit erotic drawings by Cocteau. In recent years several albums of Cocteau's homoerotica have been available to the general public.\n\nCocteau had affairs with Jean Le Roy, Raymond Radiguet, Jean Desbordes, Marcel Khill, and Panama Al Brown.\n\nIn the 1930s, Cocteau is rumoured to have had a very brief affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the daughter of a Romanov Grand Duke and herself a sometime actress, model, and former wife of couturier Lucien Lelong.\n\nCocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with French actors Jean Marais and Édouard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in \"The Eternal Return\" (1943), \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1946), \"Ruy Blas\" (1947), and \"Orpheus\" (1949).\n\nCocteau died of a heart attack at his château in Milly-la-Forêt, Essonne, France, on 11 October 1963 at the age of 74. His friend, French singer Édith Piaf, died the day before but that was announced on the morning of Cocteau's day of death; it has been said that his heart failed upon hearing of Piaf's death. Actually, according to author Roger Peyrefitte, since early that year Cocteau had been devastated after a breach with his longtime friend and extremely wealthy and generous patroness Francine Weisweiller: since 1960 she was having an affair with a minor writer, which cooled her off towards Cocteau. He had a very severe heart attack on April 22.\n\nAccording to his wishes Cocteau is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint-Blaise des Simples in Milly-la-Forêt. The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: \"I stay with you\" (\"Je reste avec vous\").\n\nIn 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the Académie française and The Royal Academy of Belgium.\n\nDuring his life, Cocteau was commander of the Legion of Honor, Member of the Mallarmé Academy, German Academy (Berlin), American Academy, Mark Twain (U.S.A) Academy, Honorary President of the Cannes Film Festival, Honorary President of the France-Hungary Association and President of the Jazz Academy and of the Academy of the Disc.\n\n!Year\n!Original title\n!English

{"id": "15838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15838", "title": "John Donne", "text": "John Donne\n\nJohn Donne ( ; 22 January 1572 – 31 March 1631) was an English poet and cleric in the Church of England.\n\nHe is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society and he met that knowledge with sharp criticism. Another important theme in Donne's poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorized. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits.\n\nDespite his great education and poetic talents, Donne lived in poverty for several years, relying heavily on wealthy friends. He spent much of the money he inherited during and after his education on womanising, literature, pastimes, and travel. In 1601, Donne secretly married Anne More, with whom he had twelve children. In 1615 he was ordained deacon and then Anglican priest, although he did not want to take Holy Orders and only did so because the king ordered it. In 1621, he was appointed the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London. He also served as a member of Parliament in 1601 and in 1614.\n\nDonne was born in London in 1572, into a recusant Roman Catholic family when practice of that religion was illegal in England. Donne was the third of six children. His father, also named John Donne, was of Welsh descent and a warden of the Ironmongers Company in the City of London. However, he avoided unwelcome government attention out of fear of persecution.\n\nHis father died in 1576, when Donne was four years old, leaving his mother, Elizabeth Heywood, with the responsibility of raising the children alone. Heywood was also from a recusant Roman Catholic family, the daughter of John Heywood, the playwright, and sister of the Reverend Jasper Heywood, a Jesuit priest and translator. She was also a great-niece of Thomas More. A few months after her husband died, Donne's mother married Dr. John Syminges, a wealthy widower with three children of his own. Donne thus acquired a stepfather.\n\nDonne was educated privately; however, there is no evidence to support the popular claim that he was taught by Jesuits. In 1583, at the age of 11, he began studies at Hart Hall, now Hertford College, Oxford. After three years of studies there, Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge, where he studied for another three years. Donne, however, could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism, since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school, one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, one of the Inns of Court.\n\nIn 1593, five years after the defeat of the Spanish Armada and during the intermittent Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), Queen Elizabeth issued the first English statute against sectarian dissent from the Church of England, titled \"An Act for restraining Popish recusants\". It defined \"Popish recusants\" as those \"convicted for not repairing to some Church, Chapel, or usual place of Common Prayer to hear Divine Service there, but forbearing the same contrary to the tenor of the laws and statutes heretofore made and provided in that behalf\". Donne's brother Henry was also a university student prior to his arrest in 1593 for harbouring a Catholic priest, William Harrington, and died in Newgate Prison of bubonic plague, leading Donne to begin questioning his Catholic faith.\n\nDuring and after his education, Donne spent much of his considerable inheritance on women, literature, pastimes and travel. Although no record details precisely where Donne travelled, he did cross Europe and later fought alongside the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh against the Spanish at Cadiz (1596) and the Azores (1597), and witnessed the loss of the Spanish flagship, the \"San Felipe\". According to his earliest biographer, \nBy the age of 25 he was well prepared for the diplomatic career he appeared to be seeking. He was appointed chief secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton, and was established at Egerton's London home, York House, Strand close to the Palace of Whitehall, then the most influential social centre in England.\n\nDuring the next four years Donne fell in love with Egerton's niece Anne More, and they were secretly married just before Christmas in 1601, against the wishes of both Egerton and George More, who was Lieutenant of the Tower and Anne's father. Upon discovery, this wedding ruined Donne's career, getting him dismissed and put in Fleet Prison, along with the Church of England priest Samuel Brooke, who married them, and the man who acted as a witness to the wedding. Donne was released shortly thereafter when the marriage was proved to be valid, and he soon secured the release of the other two. Walton tells us that when Donne wrote to his wife to tell her about losing his post, he wrote after his name: \"John Donne, Anne Donne, Un-done.\" It was not until 1609 that Donne was reconciled with his father-in-law and received his wife's dowry.\n\nAfter his release, Donne had to accept a retired country life in a small house in Pyrford, Surrey, owned by Anne's cousin, Sir Francis Wooley, where they resided until the end of 1604. In spring 1605 they moved to another small house in Mitcham, London, where he scraped a meager living as a lawyer, while Anne Donne bore a new baby almost every year. Though he also worked as an assistant pamphleteer to Thomas Morton writing anti-Catholic pamphlets, Donne was in a constant state of financial insecurity.\n\nAnne gave birth to 12 children in 16 years of marriage, (including two stillbirths—their eighth and then, in 1617, their last child); indeed, she spent most of her married life either pregnant or nursing. The 10 surviving children were Constance, John, George, Francis, Lucy (named after Donne's patron Lucy, Countess of Bedford, her godmother), Bridget, Mary, Nicholas, Margaret, and Elizabeth. Three (Francis, Nicholas, and Mary) died before they were ten. In a state of despair that almost drove him to kill himself, Donne noted that the death of a child would mean one mouth fewer to feed, but he could not afford the burial expenses. During this time, Donne wrote but did not publish \"Biathanatos\", his defence of suicide. His wife died on 15 August 1617, five days after giving birth to their twelfth child, a still-born baby. Donne mourned her deeply, and wrote of his love and loss in his Holy Sonnet.\n\nIn 1602 John Donne was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Brackley, but membership was not a paid position. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, being succeeded by King James VI of Scotland as King James I of England. The fashion for coterie poetry of the period gave Donne a means to seek patronage, and many of his poems were written for wealthy friends or patrons, especially MP Sir Robert Drury of Hawsted (1575–1615), whom he met in 1610 and became Donne's chief patron, furnishing him and his family an apartment in his large house in Drury Lane.\n\nIn 1610 and 1611 Donne wrote two anti-Catholic polemics: \"Pseudo-Martyr\" and \"Ignatius His Conclave\" for Morton. He then wrote two Anniversaries, \"\" (1611) and \"Of the Progress of the Soul\" (1612) for Drury.\n\nDonne sat as an MP again, for Taunton, in the Addled Parliament of 1614 but though he attracted five appointments within its business he made no recorded speech.\nAlthough James was pleased with Donne's work, he refused to reinstate him at court and instead urged him to take holy orders. At length, Donne acceded to the king's wishes, and in 1615 was ordained priest in the Church of England.\nIn 1615 Donne was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity from Cambridge University, and became a Royal Chaplain in the same year, and a Reader of Divinity at Lincoln's Inn in 1616, where he served in the chapel as minister until 1622. In 1618 he became chaplain to Viscount Doncaster, who was on an embassy to the . Donne did not return to England until 1620. In 1621 Donne was made Dean of St Paul's, a leading and well-paid position in the Church of England, which he held until his death in 1631. At the same time he became Rector of a number of parishes, including Blunham, in Bedfordshire. Blunham Parish Church has an imposing stained glass window commemorating Donne, designed by Derek Hunt. During his period as dean his daughter Lucy died, aged eighteen. In late November and early December 1623 he suffered a nearly fatal illness, thought to be either typhus or a combination of a cold followed by a period of fever. During his convalescence he wrote a series of meditations and prayers on health, pain, and sickness that were published as a book in 1624 under the title of \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\". One of these meditations, , contains the well known phrases \"No man is an \"Iland\"\" (often modernised as \"No man is an island\") and \"...for whom the \"bell\" tolls\". In 1624 he became vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and 1625 a prolocutor to Charles I. He earned a reputation as an eloquent preacher and 160 of his sermons have survived, including Death's Duel, his famous delivered at the Palace of Whitehall before King Charles I in February 1631.\n\nDonne died on 31 March 1631 and was buried in old St Paul's Cathedral, where a memorial statue of him by Nicholas Stone was erected with a Latin epigraph probably composed by himself. The memorial was one of the few to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 and is now in St Paul's Cathedral. The statue was said by Izaac Walton in his biography to have been modelled from the life by Donne in order to suggest his appearance at the resurrection; it was to start a vogue in such monuments during the course of the 17th century. In 2012 a bust of the poet by Nigel Boonham was unveiled outside in the cathedral churchyard.\n\nDonne's earliest poems showed a developed knowledge of English society coupled with sharp criticism of its problems. His satires dealt with common Elizabethan topics, such as corruption in the legal system, mediocre poets, and pompous courtiers. His images of sickness, vomit, manure, and plague reflected his strongly satiric view of a society populated by fools and knaves. His third satire, however, deals with the problem of true religion, a matter of great importance to Donne. He argued that it was better to examine carefully one's religious convictions than blindly to follow any established tradition, for none would be saved at the Final Judgment, by claiming \"A Harry, or a Martin taught [them] this.\"\n\nDonne's early career was also notable for his erotic poetry, especially his elegies, in which he employed unconventional metaphors, such as a flea biting two lovers being compared to sex. Donne did not publish these poems, although they circulated widely in manuscript form. One such, a previously unknown manuscript that is believed to be one of the largest contemporary collections of Donne's work (among that of others), was found at Melford Hall in November 2018.\n\nSome have speculated that Donne's numerous illnesses, financial strain, and the deaths of his friends all contributed to the development of a more somber and pious tone in his later poems. The change can be clearly seen in \"\" (1611), a poem that Donne wrote in memory of Elizabeth Drury, daughter of his patron, Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk. This poem treats Elizabeth's demise with extreme gloominess, using it as a symbol for the Fall of Man and the destruction of the universe.\n\nThe increasing gloominess of Donne's tone may also be observed in the religious works that he began writing during the same period. Having converted to the Anglican Church, Donne quickly became noted for his sermons and religious poems. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many men, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, \"Death Be Not Proud\". Even as he lay dying during Lent in 1631, he rose from his sickbed and delivered the Death's Duel sermon, which was later described as his own funeral sermon. Death's Duel portrays life as a steady descent to suffering and death; death becomes merely another process of life, in which the 'winding sheet' of the womb is the same as that of the grave. Hope is seen in salvation and immortality through an embrace of God, Christ and the Resurrection.\n\nHis work has received much criticism over the years, especially concerning his metaphysical form. Donne is generally considered the most prominent member of the metaphysical poets, a phrase coined in 1781 by Samuel Johnson, following a comment on Donne by John Dryden. Dryden had written of Donne in 1693: \"He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love.\" In \"Life of Cowley\" (from Samuel Johnson's 1781 work of biography and criticism \"Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets\"), Johnson refers to the beginning of the seventeenth century in which there \"appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets\". Donne's immediate successors in poetry therefore tended to regard his works with ambivalence, with the Neoclassical poets regarding his conceits as abuse of the metaphor. However he was revived by Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Browning, though his more recent revival in the early twentieth century by poets such as T. S. Eliot and critics like F R Leavis tended to portray him, with approval, as an anti-Romantic.\n\nDonne is considered a master of the metaphysical conceit, an extended metaphor that combines two vastly different ideas into a single idea, often using imagery. An example of this is his equation of lovers with saints in \"The Canonization\". Unlike the conceits found in other Elizabethan poetry, most notably Petrarchan conceits, which formed clichéd comparisons between more closely related objects (such as a rose and love), metaphysical conceits go to a greater depth in comparing two completely unlike objects. One of the most famous of Donne's conceits is found in \"\" where he compares the apartness of two separated lovers to the working of the legs of a compass.\n\nDonne's works are also witty, employing paradoxes, puns, and subtle yet remarkable analogies. His pieces are often ironic and cynical, especially regarding love and human motives. Common subjects of Donne's poems are love (especially in his early life), death (especially after his wife's death), and religion.\n\nJohn Donne's poetry represented a shift from classical forms to more personal poetry. Donne is noted for his poetic metre, which was structured with changing and jagged rhythms that closely resemble casual speech (it was for this that the more classical-minded Ben Jonson commented that \"Donne, for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging\").\n\nSome scholars believe that Donne's literary works reflect the changing trends of his life, with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years. Other scholars, such as Helen Gardner, question the validity of this dating—most of his poems were published posthumously (1633). The exception to these is his \"Anniversaries\", which were published in 1612 and \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\" published in 1624. His sermons are also dated, sometimes specifically by date and year.\n\nDonne is commemorated as a priest in the calendar of the Church of England and in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 31 March.\n\nDuring his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet. The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery, London which has been recently restored. One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author, the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love. The portrait was described in Donne's will as \"that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes\", and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram. Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver, also in the National Portrait Gallery, and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1911 the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to \"John Donne arriving in heaven\" (1911) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum.\n\nAfter Donne's death, a number of poetical tributes were paid to him, of which one of the principal (and most difficult to follow) was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherbury's \"Elegy for Doctor Donne\". Posthumous editions of Donne's poems were accompanied by several \"Elegies upon the Author\" over the course of the next two centuries. Six of these were written by fellow churchmen, others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew, Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter. In 1963 came Joseph Brodsky's \"The Great Elegy for John Donne\".\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donne's life. His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vining's \"Take Heed of Loving Me: A novel about John Donne\" (1963) and Maeve Haran's \"The Lady and the Poet\" (2010). Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Novik's \"Conceit\" (2007), where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge. English treatments include Garry O'Connor's \"Death's Duel: a novel of John Donne\" (2015), which deals with the poet as a young man. He also plays a significant role in Christie Dickason's \"The Noble Assassin\" (2012), a novel based on the life of Donne's patron and (the author claims) his lover, Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. Finally there is Bryan Crockett's \"Love's Alchemy: a John Donne Mystery\" (2015), in which the poet, blackmailed into service in Robert Cecil's network of spies, attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil.\n\nThere were musical settings of Donne's lyrics even during his lifetime and in the century following his death. These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger's (\"So, so, leave off this last lamenting kisse\" in his 1609 Ayres); John Cooper's (\"The Message\"); Henry Lawes' (\"Break of Day\"); John Dowland's (\"Break of Day\" and \"To ask for all thy love\"); and settings of \"A Hymn to God the Father\" by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey (published 1688). After the 17th century there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian (\"A nocturnal on St Lucy's Day\", first performed in 1905), Eleanor Everest Freer (\"Break of Day, published in 1905) and Walford Davies (\"The Cross\", 1909) among the earliest. In 1916–18, the composer Hubert Parry set Donne's \"Holy Sonnet 7\" (\"At the round earth's imagined corners\") to music in his choral work, \"Songs of Farewell\". In 1945, Benjamin Britten set nine of Donne's Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano \"The Holy Sonnets of John Donne\". Among them is also the choral setting of \"Negative Love\" that opens \"Harmonium\" (1981) by John Adams.\n\nThere have been settings in popular music as well. One is the version of the song \"Go and Catch a Falling Star\" on John Renbourn's debut album \"John Renbourn\" (1966), in which the last line is altered to \"False, ere I count one, two, three\". On their 1992 album \"Duality\", the English Neoclassical Dark Wave band In The Nursery used a recitation of the entirety of Donne's \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\" for the track \"Mecciano\" and an augmented version of \"A Fever\" for the track \"Corruption.\"\nProse texts by Donne have also been set to music. In 1954, Priaulx Rainier set some in her \"Cycle for Declamation\" for solo voice. In 2009, the American Jennifer Higdon composed the choral piece \"On the Death of the Righteous\", based on Donne's sermons. Still more recent is the Russian minimalist Anton Batagov's \" I Fear No More, selected songs and meditations of John Donne\" (2015).\n\nBULLET::::- \"Biathanatos\" (1608)\nBULLET::::- \"Pseudo-Martyr\" (1610)\nBULLET::::- \"Ignatius His Conclave\" (1611)\nBULLET::::- \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\" (1624)\nBULLET::::- \"Poems\" (1633)\n\nBULLET::::- Bald, R.

{"id": "15839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15839", "title": "Joey Ramone", "text": "Joey Ramone\n\nJeffrey Ross Hyman (May 19, 1951 – April 15, 2001), known professionally as Joey Ramone, was an American musician, singer-songwriter, and lead vocalist of the punk rock band the Ramones. Joey Ramone's image, voice, and tenure as frontman of the Ramones made him a countercultural icon.\n\nJeffrey Ross Hyman was born on May 19, 1951, in Queens, New York to a Jewish family. His parents were Charlotte (\"née\" Mandell) and Noel Hyman. \nThe family lived in Forest Hills, Queens, New York \nwhere Hyman and his future Ramones bandmates attended Forest Hills High School. Though happy, Hyman was something of an outcast, diagnosed at 18 with obsessive–compulsive disorder. He grew up with his brother Mickey Leigh. His mother, Charlotte Lesher, divorced her first husband, Noel Hyman. She married a second time but was widowed by a car accident while she was on vacation. Joey was born with a parasitic twin growing out of his back, which was incompletely formed and surgically removed.\n\nHyman was a fan of the Beatles, the Who, David Bowie, and the Stooges among other bands, particularly oldies and the Phil Spector-produced \"girl groups\". His idol was Pete Townshend of the Who, with whom he shared a birthday. Hyman took up the drums at 13, and played them throughout his teen years before picking up an acoustic guitar at age 17.\n\nIn 1972 Hyman joined the glam punk band Sniper. Sniper played at the Mercer Arts Center, Max's Kansas City and the Coventry, alongside the New York Dolls, Suicide, and Queen Elizabeth III. Hyman played with Sniper under the name Jeff Starship. \nHyman continued playing with Sniper until early 1974, when he was replaced by Alan Turner.\n\nIn 1974, Jeffrey Hyman co-founded the punk rock band the Ramones with friends John Cummings and Douglas Colvin. Colvin was already using the pseudonym \"Dee Dee Ramone\" and the others also adopted stage names using \"Ramone\" as their surname: Cummings became Johnny Ramone and Hyman became Joey Ramone. The name \"Ramone\" stems from Paul McCartney: he briefly used the stage name \"Paul Ramon\" during 1960/1961, when the Beatles, still an unknown five-piece band called the Silver Beetles, did a tour of Scotland and all took up pseudonyms; and again on the 1969 Steve Miller album \"Brave New World\", where he played the drums on one song using that name.\n\nJoey initially served as the group's drummer while Dee Dee Ramone was the original vocalist. However, when Dee Dee's vocal cords proved unable to sustain the demands of consistent live performances, Ramones manager Thomas Erdelyi suggested Joey switch to vocals. Mickey Leigh: \"I was shocked when the band came out. Joey was the lead singer and I couldn't believe how good he was. Because he'd been sitting in my house with my acoustic guitar, writing these songs like 'I Don't Care', fucking up my guitar, and suddenly he's this guy on stage who you can't take your eyes off of.\" After a series of unsuccessful auditions in search of a new drummer, Erdelyi took over on drums, assuming the name Tommy Ramone.\n\nThe Ramones were a major influence on the punk rock movement in the United States, though they achieved only minor commercial success. Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold in Joey's lifetime was the compilation album \"Ramones Mania\". Recognition of the band's importance built over the years, and they are now regularly represented in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the \"Rolling Stone\" lists of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and 25 Greatest Live Albums of All Time, VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and Mojo's 100 Greatest Albums. In 2002, the Ramones were voted the second greatest rock and roll band ever in \"Spin\", trailing only the Beatles.\n\nIn 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played their final show and then disbanded.\n\nRamone's voice was within a tenor range. His signature cracks, hiccups, snarls, crooning and youthful voice made his one of punk rock's most recognizable voices. Allmusic.com claims that \"Joey Ramone's signature bleat was the voice of punk rock in America.\" As his vocals matured and deepened through his career, so did the Ramones' songwriting, leaving a notable difference from his initial melodic and callow style—two notable tracks serving as examples are \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink\" and \"Mama's Boy\". Dee Dee Ramone was quoted as saying \"All the other singers [in New York] were copying David Johansen (of the New York Dolls), who was copying Mick Jagger... But Joey was unique, totally unique.\"\n\nIn 1985, Ramone joined Steven Van Zandt's music industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid, which campaigned against the Sun City resort in South Africa. Ramone and 49 other recording artists – including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, Lou Reed and Run DMC — collaborated on the song \"Sun City\", in which they pledged they would never perform at the resort.\n\nIn 1994, Ramone appeared on the Helen Love album \"Love and Glitter, Hot Days and Music\", singing the track \"Punk Boy\". Helen Love returned the favor, singing on Ramone's song \"Mr. Punchy\".\n\nIn October 1996, Ramone headlined the \"Rock the Reservation\" alternative rock festival in Tuba City, Arizona. 'Joey Ramone & the Resistance' (Daniel Rey on guitar, John Connor on bass guitar and Roger Murdock on drums) debuted Ramone's interpretation of Louis Armstrong's \"Wonderful World' live, as well as Ramone's choice of Ramones classics and some of his other favorite songs; The Dave Clark Five's \"Any Way You Want It\", The Who's \"The Kids are Alright\" and The Stooges' \"No Fun.\"\n\nRamone co-wrote and recorded the song \"Meatball Sandwich\" with Youth Gone Mad. For a short time before his death, he took the role of manager and producer for the punk rock band the Independents.\n\nHis last recording as a vocalist was backup vocals on the CD \"One Nation Under\" by the Dine Navajo rock group Blackfire. He appeared on two tracks, \"What Do You See\" and \"Lying to Myself\". The 2002 CD won \"Best Pop/Rock Album of the Year\" at the 2002 Native American Music Awards.\n\nRamone produced the Ronnie Spector album \"She Talks to Rainbows\" in 1999. It was critically acclaimed but was not very commercially successful. The title track was previously on the Ramones' final studio album, \"¡Adios Amigos!\".\n\nJoey Ramone died following a seven-year battle with lymphoma at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on April 15, 2001, a month before he would have turned 50. He was reportedly listening to the song \"In a Little While\" by U2 when he died. In an interview in 2014 for Radio 538, U2 lead singer Bono confirmed that Joey Ramone's family told him that Ramone listened to the song before he died, which Andy Shernoff (The Dictators) also confirmed.\n\nHis solo album \"Don't Worry About Me\" was released posthumously in 2002, and features the single \"What a Wonderful World\", a cover of the Louis Armstrong standard. MTV News claimed: \"With his trademark rose-colored shades, black leather jacket, shoulder-length hair, ripped jeans and alternately snarling and crooning vocals, Joey was the iconic godfather of punk.\"\n\nOn November 30, 2003, a block of East 2nd Street in New York City was officially renamed Joey Ramone Place. It is the block where Hyman once lived with bandmate Dee Dee Ramone and is near the former site of the music club CBGB, where the Ramones got their start. Hyman's birthday is celebrated annually by rock 'n' roll nightclubs, hosted in New York City by his brother and, until 2007, his mother, Charlotte. Joey Ramone is interred at Hillside Cemetery in Lyndhurst, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2001, the Ramones were named as inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, prior to the ceremony held early the following year.\n\nSeveral songs have been written in tribute to Joey Ramone. Tommy, CJ and Marky Ramone and Daniel Rey came together in 2002 to record Jed Davis' Joey Ramone tribute album, \"The Bowery Electric\". Other tributes include \"Hello Joe\" by Blondie from the album \"The Curse of Blondie\", \"Don't Take Me For Granted\" by Social Distortion, \"Here's To You\" by Minus3, \"You Can't Kill Joey Ramone\" by Sloppy Seconds, \"Joey\" by Raimundos, \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\" by Sleater-Kinney, \"Red and White Stripes\" by Moler and \"Joey\" by the Corin Tucker Band, \"I Heard Ramona Sing\" by Frank Black, and Amy Rigby's \"Dancin' With Joey Ramone\". Rammstein ended several shows of their Mutter tour in 2001 with a cover of \"Pet Sematary\" in honor of the passing of Joey Ramone.\n\nIn September 2010, the Associated Press reported that \"Joey Ramone Place,\" a sign at the corner of Bowery and East Second Street, was New York City's most stolen sign. Later, the sign was moved to 20 feet above ground level.

{"id": "15852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15852", "title": "John Lennon", "text": "John Lennon\n\nJohn Winston Ono Lennon (born John Winston Lennon, 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter and peace activist who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist.\n\nBorn in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", and the international top 10 singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\".\n\nLennon was known for the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. He was controversial through his political and peace activism. After moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him. In 1975, Lennon disengaged from the music business to raise his infant son Sean, and in 1980, returned with the Ono collaboration \"Double Fantasy\". He was shot and killed in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album's release.\n\nBy 2018, Lennon's solo equivalent album sales had exceeded 72 million units worldwide. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, and in 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1987, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lennon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.\n\nLennon was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (née Stanley) (1914–1958) and Alfred Lennon (1912–1976). Alfred was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of his son's birth. His parents named him John Winston Lennon after his paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the cheques stopped when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them – with her partner at the time, Bobby Dykins – and after a heated argument, his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. In one account of this incident, Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her. According to author Mark Lewisohn, however, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said that the dramatic portrayal of a young John Lennon being forced to make a decision between his parents is inaccurate. Lennon had no further contact with Alf for close to 20 years.\n\nThroughout the rest of his childhood and adolescence, Lennon lived at Mendips, 251Menlove Avenue, Woolton, with Mimi and her husband George Toogood Smith, who had no children of their own. His aunt purchased volumes of short stories for him, and his uncle, a dairyman at his family's farm, bought him a mouth organ and engaged him in solving puzzles. Julia visited Mendips on a regular basis, and when John was 11 years old, he often visited her at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where she played him Elvis Presley records, taught him the banjo, and showed him how to play \"Ain't That a Shame\" by Fats Domino. In September 1980, Lennon commented about his family and his rebellious nature:\n\nHe regularly visited his cousin, Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas. During the school holidays, Parkes often visited Lennon with Leila Harvey, another cousin, and the threesome often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby. After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, \"John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would drive up to the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16.\" Lennon's uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955, at age 52.\n\nLennon was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School. After passing his eleven-plus exam, he attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Harvey at the time as a \"happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad\". He often drew comical cartoons that appeared in his own, self-made school magazine called the \"Daily Howl\".\n\nIn 1956, Julia bought John his first guitar. The instrument was an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which she lent her son five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations. Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, \"The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.\" On 15 July 1958, Lennon's mother was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.\n\nLennon's high school years were marked by a shift in his behaviour. Teachers at Quarry Bank High School described him, \"He has too many wrong ambitions and his energy is often misplaced.\" and “His work always lacks effort. He is content to “drift” instead of using his abilities.” These descriptions created a rift in his relationship with his aunt.\n\nLennon failed his O-level examinations and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art after his aunt and headmaster intervened. At the college, he started wearing Teddy Boy clothes and was threatened with expulsion for his behaviour. In the description of Cynthia Powell, Lennon's fellow student, and subsequently his wife, he was \"thrown out of the college before his final year\".\n\nAt age 15, Lennon formed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, the group was established by Lennon in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll. Lennon first met Paul McCartney at the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St Peter's Church garden fête. Lennon then asked McCartney to join the band.\n\nMcCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that John's friends were lower class\", and would often patronise him when he arrived to visit Lennon. According to McCartney's brother Mike, their father similarly disapproved of Lennon, declaring that Lennon would get his son \"into trouble\". McCartney's father nevertheless allowed the fledgling band to rehearse in the family's front room at 20Forthlin Road. During this time, Lennon wrote his first song, \"Hello Little Girl\", which became a UK top 10 hit for the Fourmost in 1963.\n\nMcCartney recommended his friend George Harrison to be the lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played \"Raunchy\" for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles were engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennon's aunt, horrified when he told her about the trip, pleaded with Lennon to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.\nBrian Epstein managed the Beatles from 1962 until his death in 1967. He had no previous experience managing artists, but he had a strong influence on the group's dress code and attitude on stage. Lennon initially resisted his attempts to encourage the band to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying, \"I'll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay me.\" McCartney took over on bass after Sutcliffe decided to stay in Hamburg, and Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until the group's break-up in 1970. The band's first single, \"Love Me Do\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. They recorded their debut album, \"Please Please Me\", in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when Lennon was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded that day, \"Twist and Shout\". The Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of its fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itself, Lennon had yet to bring his love of wordplay to bear on his song lyrics, saying: \"We were just writing songs... pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\". In a 1987 interview, McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised Lennon: \"He was like our own little Elvis... We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.\"\n\nThe Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at the audience: \"For our next song, I'd like to ask for your help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.\" After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, \"In His Own Write\" and \"A Spaniard in the Works\". The Beatles received recognition from the British establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\nLennon grew concerned that fans who attended Beatles concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon's \"Help!\" expressed his own feelings in 1965: \"I \"meant\" it... It was me singing 'help'\". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his \"Fat Elvis\" period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he and Harrison were unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire; Lennon recalled: \"We were all screaming... hot and hysterical.\"\n\nAfter the band's final concert on 29 August 1966, Lennon filmed the anti-war black comedy \"How I Won the War\" – his only appearance in a non-Beatles feature film – before rejoining his bandmates for an extended period of recording, beginning in November. Lennon had increased his use of LSD and, according to author Ian MacDonald, his continuous use of the drug in 1967 brought him \"close to erasing his identity\". The year 1967 saw the release of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", hailed by \"Time\" magazine for its \"astonishing inventiveness\", and the group's landmark album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which revealed lyrics by Lennon that contrasted strongly with the simple love songs of the group's early years. In late June, the Beatles performed Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" as Britain's contribution to the \"Our World\" satellite broadcast, before an international audience estimated at up to 400 million. Intentionally simplistic in its message, the song formalised his pacifist stance and provided an anthem for the Summer of Love.\n\nAfter the Beatles were introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the group attended an August weekend of personal instruction at his Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales. During the seminar, they were informed of Epstein's death. \"I knew we were in trouble then\", Lennon said later. \"I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music. I was scared – I thought, 'We've fucking had it now.'\" McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film \"Magical Mystery Tour\", which was released in December that year. While the film itself proved to be their first critical flop, its soundtrack release, featuring Lennon's Lewis Carroll-inspired \"I Am the Walrus\", was a success.\n\nLed by Harrison and Lennon's interest, the Beatles travelled to the Maharishi's ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance. While there, they composed most of the songs for their double album \"The Beatles\", but the band members' mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the group's camaraderie. On their return to London, they became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies. Lennon described the venture as an attempt to achieve \"artistic freedom within a business structure\". Released amid a period of civic unrest and protests, the band's debut single for the Apple label included Lennon's B-side \"Revolution\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to Maoist revolution. The song's pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press. Adding to the tensions at the Beatles' recording sessions that year, Lennon insisted on having his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, beside him, thereby contravening the band's policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. He was especially pleased with his songwriting contributions to the double album and identified it as a superior work to \"Sgt. Pepper\". At the end of 1968, Lennon was featured in the film \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\" in the role of a Dirty Mac band member. The film was not released until 1996. The supergroup, composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell, also backed a vocal performance by Ono in the film.\nBy late 1968, Lennon's increased drug use and growing preoccupation with Ono, combined with the Beatles' inability to agree on how the company should be run, left Apple in need of professional management. Lennon asked Lord Beeching to take on the role, but he declined, advising Lennon to go back to making records. Lennon was approached by Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion. In early 1969, Klein was appointed as Apple's chief executive by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, but McCartney never signed the management contract. Lennon and Ono were married on 20 March 1969, and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from their honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. Lennon's creative focus continued to move beyond the Beatles, and between 1968 and 1969 he and Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: \"\" (known more for its cover than for its music), \"\" and \"Wedding Album\". In 1969, they formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing \"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\". Between 1969 and 1970, Lennon released the singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", which was widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam War anthem, \"Cold Turkey\", which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin, and \"Instant Karma!\"\nIn protest at Britain's involvement in \"the Nigeria-Biafra thing\" (namely, the Nigerian Civil War), its support of America in the Vietnam War and (perhaps jokingly) against \"Cold Turkey\" slipping down the charts, Lennon returned his MBE medal to the Queen. This gesture had no effect on his MBE status, which could not be renounced. The medal, together with Lennon's letter, is held at the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.\n\nLennon left the Beatles in September 1969, but agreed not to inform the media while the group renegotiated their recording contract. He was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, \"Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!\" He later wrote, \"I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that.\" In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, \"I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record.\" Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison and Starr \"got fed up with being sidemen for Paul ... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading us when we went round in circles?\"\n\nIn 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\" The album featured the song \"Mother\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \"Working Class Hero\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \"you're still fucking peasants\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \"Power to the People\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \"Revolution\", although he later disowned \"Power to the People\", saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of \"Oz\" magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \"disgusting fascism\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \"God Save Us/Do the Oz\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.\n\nEager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, \"Imagine\" (1971). \"Rolling Stone\" reported that \"it contains a substantial portion of good music\" but warned of the possibility that \"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \"How Do You Sleep?\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on \"Ram\" that Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at him and Ono. In \"Jealous Guy\", Lennon addressed his demeaning treatment of women, acknowledging that his past behaviour was the result of long-held insecurity. In gratitude for his guitar contributions to \"Imagine\", Lennon initially agreed to perform at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York. Harrison refused to allow Ono to participate at the concerts, however, which resulted in the couple having a heated argument and Lennon pulling out of the event.\n\nLennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. The couple released their \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" single in December. During the new year, the Nixon administration took what it called a \"strategic counter-measure\" against Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. The administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport him. Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and he was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.\n\n\"Some Time in New York City\" was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's Memory. A double LP, it contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. The album was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found its political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The \"NME\"s review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided Lennon as a \"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\". In the US, \"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\" was released as a single from the album and was televised on 11 May, on \"The Dick Cavett Show\". Many radio stations refused to broadcast the song because of the word \"nigger\". Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, they were his last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin. Lennon was depressed and got intoxicated; he left Ono embarrassed after he had sex with a female guest. Ono's song \"Death of Samantha\" was inspired by the incident.\n\nWhile Lennon was recording \"Mind Games\" in 1973, he and Ono decided to separate. The ensuing 18-month period apart, which he later called his \"lost weekend\", was spent in Los Angeles and New York City in the company of May Pang. \"Mind Games\", credited to the \"Plastic U.F.Ono Band\", was released in November 1973. Lennon also contributed \"I'm the Greatest\" to Starr's album \"Ringo\" (1973), released the same month. With Harrison joining Starr and Lennon at the recording session for the song, it marked the only occasion when three former Beatles recorded together between the band's break-up and Lennon's death.\n\nIn early 1974, Lennon was drinking heavily and his alcohol-fuelled antics with Harry Nilsson made headlines. In March, two widely publicised incidents occurred at The Troubadour club. In the first incident, Lennon stuck an unused menstrual pad on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress. The second incident occurred two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon decided to produce Nilsson's album \"Pussy Cats\", and Pang rented a Los Angeles beach house for all the musicians. After a month of further debauchery, the recording sessions were in chaos, and Lennon returned to New York with Pang to finish work on the album. In April, Lennon had produced the Mick Jagger song \"Too Many Cooks (Spoil the Soup)\" which was, for contractual reasons, to remain unreleased for more than 30 years. Pang supplied the recording for its eventual inclusion on \"The Very Best of Mick Jagger\" (2007).\n\nLennon had settled back in New York when he recorded the album \"Walls and Bridges\". Released in October 1974, it included \"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\", which featured Elton John on backing vocals and piano, and became Lennon's only single as a solo artist to top the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart during his lifetime. A second single from the album, \"#9 Dream\", followed before the end of the year. Starr's \"Goodnight Vienna\" (1974) again saw assistance from Lennon, who wrote the title track and played piano. On 28 November, Lennon made a surprise guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving concert at Madison Square Garden, in fulfilment of his promise to join the singer in a live show if \"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\", a song whose commercial potential Lennon had doubted, reached number one. Lennon performed the song along with \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Saw Her Standing There\", which he introduced as \"a song by an old estranged fiancé of mine called Paul\".\n\nLennon co-wrote \"Fame\", David Bowie's first US number one, and provided guitar and backing vocals for the January 1975 recording. In the same month, Elton John topped the charts with his cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", featuring Lennon on guitar and back-up vocals; Lennon is credited on the single under the moniker of \"Dr. Winston O'Boogie\". He and Ono were reunited shortly afterwards. Lennon released \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (1975), an album of cover songs, in February. \"Stand by Me\", taken from the album and a US and UK hit, became his last single for five years. He made what would be his final stage appearance in the ATV special \"A Salute to Lew Grade\", recorded on 18 April and televised in June. Playing acoustic guitar and backed by an eight-piece band, Lennon performed two songs from \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (\"Stand by Me\", which was not broadcast, and \"Slippin' and Slidin'\") followed by \"Imagine\". The band, known as Etc., wore masks behind their heads, a dig by Lennon, who thought Grade was two-faced.\n\nSean was Lennon's only child with Ono. Sean was born on 9 October 1975 (Lennon's thirty-fifth birthday), and John took on the role of househusband. Lennon began what would be a five-year hiatus from the music industry, during which time, he later said, he \"baked bread\" and \"looked after the baby\". He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote \"Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)\" for Starr's \"Ringo's Rotogravure\" (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, \"we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby as much as we can until we feel we can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family.\" During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed \"mad stuff\", all of which would be published posthumously.\n\nLennon emerged from his five-year interruption in music recording in October 1980, when he released the single \"(Just Like) Starting Over\". The following month saw the release of \"Double Fantasy\", which contained songs written during a June 1980 journey to Bermuda on a 43-foot sailing boat. The music reflected Lennon's fulfilment in his new-found stable family life. Sufficient additional material was recorded for a planned follow-up album \"Milk and Honey\", which was released posthumously, in 1984. \"Double Fantasy\" was jointly released by Lennon and Ono very shortly before his death; the album was not well received and drew comments such as \"Melody Maker\"'s \"indulgent sterility... a godawful yawn\".\n\nAt approximately 5:00 p.m. on 8 December 1980, Lennon autographed a copy of \"Double Fantasy\" for fan Mark David Chapman before leaving The Dakota with Yoko for a recording session at the Record Plant. After the session, Lennon and Ono returned to their Manhattan apartment in a limousine at around 10:50p.m. EST. They exited the vehicle and walked through the archway of the building when Chapman shot Lennon four times in the back at close range. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to the emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:00p.m. (EST).\nOno issued a statement the next day, saying \"There is no funeral for John\", ending it with the words, \"John loved and prayed for the human race. Please do the same for him.\" His remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Ono scattered his ashes in New York's Central Park, where the Strawberry Fields memorial was later created. Chapman avoided going to trial when he ignored his attorney's advice and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20-years-to-life.\n\nIn the weeks following the murder, \"(Just Like) Starting Over\" and \"Double Fantasy\" topped the charts in the UK and the US. In a further example of the public outpouring of grief, \"Imagine\" hit number one in the UK in January 1981 and \"Happy Xmas\" peaked at number two. Later that year, Roxy Music's cover version of \"Jealous Guy\", recorded as a tribute to Lennon, was also a UK number-one.\n\nLennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \"Getting Better\" told his own story, \"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\"\n\nRecalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the U.K. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.\n\nCynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia arrived home at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have had sex with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on the grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in U.S. dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.\n\nThe Beatles were performing at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 when they were introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage the group was that he was attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, \"Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do you like that one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this.\" Soon after their return from Spain, at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963, Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying \"How was your honeymoon, John?\" The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. Lennon was drunk at the time and the matter was simple: \"He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in.\"\n\nLennon delighted in mocking Epstein for his homosexuality and for the fact that he was Jewish. When Epstein invited suggestions for the title of his autobiography, Lennon offered \"Queer Jew\"; on learning of the eventual title, \"A Cellarful of Noise\", he parodied, \"More like \"A Cellarful of Boys\"\". He demanded of a visitor to Epstein's flat, \"Have you come to blackmail him? If not, you're the only bugger in London who hasn't.\" During the recording of \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\", he sang altered choruses of \"Baby, you're a rich fag Jew\".\n\nDuring his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \"It's not an acid song.\" Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \"Hey Jules\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \"Hey Jude\". Lennon later said, \"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\"\n\nLennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, Julian did not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian and his mother to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a \"Walls and Bridges\" track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \"got on a great deal better\" during the time he spent in New York: \"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\"\n\nIn a \"Playboy\" interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \"Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\" He said he was trying to reestablish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\" After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.\n\nLennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer A Nail\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" According to Lennon's recollection in 1980, Ono had not heard of the Beatles, but she relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon said he replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work \"Apple\", much to her fury.\n\nOno began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the \"Two Virgins\" album, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.\n\nTwo years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States, but were denied entry, so held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \"Bagism\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". Lennon changed his name by deed poll on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. The brief ceremony took place on the roof of the Apple Corps building, where the Beatles had performed their rooftop concert three months earlier. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire. After Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-size bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last album, \"Abbey Road\".\n\nOno and Lennon moved to New York, to a flat on Bank Street, Greenwich Village. Looking for somewhere with better security, they relocated in 1973 to the more secure Dakota overlooking Central Park at 1West72nd Street.\n\nABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \"He likes you a lot.\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \"lost weekend\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.\n\nIn June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.\n\nOno had previously suffered three miscarriages in her attempt to have a child with Lennon. When Ono and Lennon were reunited, she became pregnant again. She initially said that she wanted to have an abortion but changed her mind and agreed to allow the pregnancy to continue on condition that Lennon adopt the role of househusband, which he agreed to do.\n\nFollowing Sean's birth, Lennon's subsequent hiatus from the music industry would span five years. He had a photographer take pictures of Sean every day of his first year and created numerous drawings for him, which were posthumously published as \"Real Love: The Drawings for Sean\". Lennon later proudly declared, \"He didn't come out of my belly but, by God, I made his bones, because I've attended to every meal, and to how he sleeps, and to the fact that he swims like a fish.\"\n\nWhile Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 \"Dark Horse\" tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told \"Playboy\", \"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\"\n\nLennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \"How Do You Sleep?\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in which Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. According to Lennon, the pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono... That ain't bad picking.\"\n\nAlong with his estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical competitiveness with him and kept an ear on his music. During his career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, Lennon and Ono's assistant at the time, Lennon was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released \"Coming Up\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving me crackers!\" he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. But he also said, \"I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.\"\n\nLennon and Ono used their honeymoon as a Bed-In for Peace at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel; the March 1969 event attracted worldwide media ridicule. During a second Bed-In three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Lennon wrote and recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". Released as a single, the song was quickly interpreted as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the Vietnam War in Washington, DC, on 15 November, the second Vietnam Moratorium Day. In December, they paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, \"War Is Over! If You Want It\".\n\nDuring the year, Lennon and Ono began to support efforts by the family of James Hanratty to prove his innocence. Hanratty had been hanged in 1962. According to Lennon, those who had condemned Hanratty were \"the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets ... The same bastards are in control, the same people are running everything, it's the whole bullshit bourgeois scene.\" In London, Lennon and Ono staged a \"Britain Murdered Hanratty\" banner march and a \"Silent Protest For James Hanratty\", and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an appeal hearing more than thirty years later, Hanratty's conviction was upheld after DNA evidence was found to match.\n\nLennon and Ono showed their solidarity with the Clydeside UCS workers' work-in of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for £5,000. On moving to New York City in August that year, they befriended two of the Chicago Seven, Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Another political activist, John Sinclair, poet and co-founder of the White Panther Party, was serving ten years in prison for selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of the drug. In December 1971 at Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15,000 people attended the \"John Sinclair Freedom Rally\", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, and others. Lennon and Ono, backed by David Peel and Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from their forthcoming \"Some Time in New York City\" album including \"John Sinclair\", whose lyrics called for his release. The day before the rally, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later Sinclair was released on an appeal bond. The performance was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on \"John Lennon Anthology\" (1998).\n\nFollowing the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, in which fourteen unarmed civil rights protesters were shot dead by the British Army, Lennon said that given the choice between the army and the IRA (who were not involved in the incident) he would side with the latter. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their \"Some Time in New York City\" album: \"The Luck of the Irish\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's domestic security service MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film \"The Irish Tapes\", a political documentary with a Republican slant.\nAccording to FBI surveillance reports, and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006, Lennon was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group, a Trotskyist group formed in Britain in 1968. However, the FBI considered Lennon to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary, as he was \"constantly under the influence of narcotics\".\n\nIn 1973, Lennon contributed a limerick called \"Why Make It Sad to Be Gay?\" to Len Richmond's \"The Gay Liberation Book\".\n\nLennon's last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. He and Ono planned to join the workers' protest on 14 December.\n\nFollowing the impact of \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" on the anti-war movement, the Nixon administration heard rumours of Lennon's involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the Republican National Convention and tried to have him deported. Nixon believed that Lennon's anti-war activities could cost him his reelection; Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that \"deportation would be a strategic counter-measure\" against Lennon. The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that his 1968 misdemeanour conviction for cannabis possession in London had made him ineligible for admission to the United States. Lennon spent the next three and a half years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating \"the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds\". While the legal battle continued, Lennon attended rallies and made television appearances. Lennon and Ono co-hosted \"The Mike Douglas Show\" for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to mid-America. In 1972, Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the INS defending Lennon, stating:\n\nJohn and Yoko add a great voice and drive to the country's so-called art institution. They inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing that, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for John and Yoko. Let them stay and live here and breathe. The country's got plenty of room and space. Let John and Yoko stay!\n\nOn 23 March 1973, Lennon was ordered to leave the US within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence. In response, Lennon and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where they announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with \"no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people\". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), they asked for political asylum in the US. The press conference was filmed, and appeared in 2006 documentary \"The US vs. John Lennon\". Soon after the press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, DC. They led to the president's resignation 14 months later. In December 1974, when he and members of his tour entourage visited the White House, Harrison asked Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, to intercede in the matter. Ford's administration showed little interest in continuing the battle against Lennon, and the deportation order was overturned in 1975. The following year, Lennon received his \"green card\" certifying his permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, Lennon and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.\n\nAfter Lennon's death, historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files that documented the Bureau's role in the deportation attempt. The FBI admitted it had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them on the grounds that they contained national security information. In 1983, Wiener sued the FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. It took 14 years of litigation to force the FBI to release the withheld pages. The ACLU, representing Wiener, won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in April 1992, but the court declined to review the case. In 1997, respecting President Bill Clinton's newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing them would involve \"foreseeable harm\", the Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.\n\nWiener published the results of his 14-year campaign in January 2000. \"Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files\" contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which Lennon appeared, and a proposal that Lennon be arrested by local police on drug charges\". The story is told in the documentary \"The US vs. John Lennon\". The final 10 documents in Lennon's FBI file, which reported on his ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. They contained no indication that the British government had regarded Lennon as a serious threat; one example of the released material was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped Lennon would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room.\n\nBeatles biographer Bill Harry wrote that Lennon began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of his uncle. He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the \"Daily Howl\". The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the \"Daily Howl\" to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon \"had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up\", and in Lennon's story \"A Carrot in a Potato Mine\", \"the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog – also wearing glasses\".\n\nLennon's love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when he was 24. Harry writes that \"In His Own Write\" (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to me and I ended up showing him the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how the first one came about\". Like the \"Daily Howl\" it contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging his tail – until he suddenly hears a message that he will be killed at three o'clock\". \"The Times Literary Supplement\" considered the poems and stories \"remarkable ... also very funny ... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". \"Book Week\" reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well Lennon has brought it off. While some of his homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" Lennon was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that the book was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took the book more seriously than I did myself. It just began as a laugh for me\".\n\nIn combination with \"A Spaniard in the Works\" (1965), \"In His Own Write\" formed the basis of the stage play \"The John Lennon Play: In His Own Write\", co-adapted by Victor Spinetti and Adrienne Kennedy. After negotiations between Lennon, Spinetti and the artistic director of the National Theatre, Sir Laurence Olivier, the play opened at The Old Vic in 1968. Lennon and Ono attended the opening night performance, their second public appearance together. In 1969, Lennon wrote \"Four in Hand\", a skit based on his teenage experiences of group masturbation, for Kenneth Tynan's play \"Oh! Calcutta!\" After Lennon's death, further works were published, including \"Skywriting by Word of Mouth\" (1986), \"Ai: Japan Through John Lennon's Eyes: A Personal Sketchbook\" (1992), with Lennon's illustrations of the definitions of Japanese words, and \"Real Love: The Drawings for Sean\" (1999). \"The Beatles Anthology\" (2000) also presented examples of his writings and drawings.\n\nLennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a harmonica he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger had left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.\n\nAs his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. \"Double Fantasy\" producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"The Long and Winding Road\", \"Helter Skelter\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \"Imagine\", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" in 1967.\n\nWhen the Beatles recorded \"Twist and Shout\", the final track during the mammoth one-day session that produced the band's 1963 debut album, \"Please Please Me\", Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, \"I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming.\" In the words of biographer Barry Miles, \"Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords in the interests of rock 'n' roll.\" The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon \"had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice! ... put something on it... Make it \"different\".'\" Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.\n\nAs his Beatles era segued into his solo career, his singing voice found a widening range of expression. Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of 'Cold Turkey' and the cathartic \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\".\" Music critic Robert Christgau calls this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\" David Stuart Ryan notes Lennon's vocal delivery to range from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style. Wiener too describes contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\". Music historian Ben Urish recalls hearing the Beatles' \"Ed Sullivan Show\" performance of \"This Boy\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had.\"\n\nMusic historians Schinder and Schwartz wrote of the transformation in popular music styles that took place between the 1950s and the 1960s. They said that the Beatles' influence cannot be overstated: having \"revolutionised the sound, style, and attitude of popular music and opened rock and roll's doors to a tidal wave of British rock acts\", the group then \"spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers\". Liam Gallagher and his group Oasis were among the many who acknowledged the band's influence; he identified Lennon as a hero. In 1999, he named his first son Lennon Gallagher in tribute. On National Poetry Day in 1999, the BBC conducted a poll to identify the UK's favourite song lyric and announced \"Imagine\" as the winner.\n\nIn 1997, Yoko Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition programme for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honour John Lennon's memory and his large creative legacy. Over $400,000 have been given through BMI Foundation's \"John Lennon Scholarships\" to talented young musicians in the United States.\n\nIn a 2006 \"Guardian\" article, Jon Wiener wrote: \"For young people in 1972, it was thrilling to see Lennon's courage in standing up to [US President] Nixon. That willingness to take risks with his career, and his life, is one reason why people still admire him today.\" For music historians Urish and Bielen, Lennon's most significant effort was \"the self-portraits ... in his songs [which] spoke to, for, and about, the human condition.\"\n\nIn 2013, Downtown Music Publishing signed a publishing administration agreement for the US with Lenono Music and Ono Music, home to the song catalogues of John Lennon and Yoko Ono respectively. Under the terms of the agreement, Downtown represents Lennon's solo works, including \"Imagine\", \"Instant Karma (We All Shine On)\", \"Power to the People\", \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\", \"Jealous Guy\", \"(Just Like) Starting Over\" and others.\nLennon continues to be mourned throughout the world and has been the subject of numerous memorials and tributes. In 2002, the airport in Lennon's home town was renamed the Liverpool John Lennon Airport. On what would have been Lennon's 70th birthday in 2010, Cynthia and Julian Lennon unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in Chavasse Park, Liverpool. The sculpture, entitled \"Peace & Harmony\", exhibits peace symbols and carries the inscription \"Peace on Earth for the Conservation of Life · In Honour of John Lennon 1940–1980\". In December 2013, the International Astronomical Union named one of the craters on Mercury after Lennon.\n\nThe Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership is regarded as one of the most influential and successful of the 20th century. As performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number one singles in the US Hot 100 chart. His album sales in the US stand at 14 million units. \"Double Fantasy\" was his best-selling solo album, at three million shipments in the US. Released shortly before his death, it won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The following year, the BRIT Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music was given to Lennon.\n\nParticipants in a 2002 BBC poll voted him eighth of \"100 Greatest Britons\". Between 2003 and 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" recognised Lennon in several reviews of artists and music, ranking him fifth of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" and 38th of \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", and his albums \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"Imagine\", 22nd and 76th respectively of \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) with the other Beatles in 1965 (returned in 1969). Lennon was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Apple, 1968)\nBULLET::::- \"\" (Zapple, 1969)\nBULLET::::- \"Wedding Album\" (Apple, 1969)\nBULLET::::- \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (Apple, 1970)\nBULLET::::- \"Imagine\" (Apple, 1971)\nBULLET::::- \"Some Time in New York City\" (Apple, 1972)\nBULLET::::- \"Mind Games\" (Apple, 1973)\nBULLET::::- \"Walls and Bridges\" (Apple, 1974)\nBULLET::::- \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (Apple, 1975)\nBULLET::::- \"Double Fantasy\" (Geffen, 1980)\nBULLET::::- \"Milk and Honey\" (Geffen, 1984)\n\nIn October 2018, by combining all format sales (physical albums, physical singles, music videos, digital downloads / ringtones, audio streams, video streams, etc.) with adapted weightings (for instance, 1 physical single = 3/10 album), Lennon's solo equivalent album sales have reached worldwide 72,647,000 units.\nBy 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the US had exceeded 14 million units.

{"id": "15858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15858", "title": "John Cleese", "text": "John Cleese\n\nJohn Marwood Cleese (; born 27 October 1939) is an English actor, voice actor, comedian, screenwriter, and producer. He achieved success at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and as a scriptwriter and performer on \"The Frost Report\". In the late 1960s, he co-founded Monty Python, the comedy troupe responsible for the sketch show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\" Along with his Python co-stars Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman, Cleese starred in Monty Python films, which include \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975), \"Life of Brian\" (1979) and \"The Meaning of Life\" (1983).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Cleese and his first wife, Connie Booth, co-wrote the sitcom \"Fawlty Towers\", and he starred in it as Basil Fawlty. The series resulted in Cleese receiving the 1980 BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance, and in 2000 the show topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Basil was ranked second on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. Cleese co-starred with Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and former Python colleague Michael Palin in \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1989) and \"Fierce Creatures\" (1997), both of which he also wrote; for \"A Fish Called Wanda\", he was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He has also starred in \"Time Bandits\" (1981) and \"Rat Race\" (2001) and has appeared in many other films, including \"Silverado\" (1985), \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" (1994), two \"James Bond\" films (as R and Q), two \"Harry Potter\" films (as Nearly Headless Nick), and three \"Shrek\" films.\n\nEmerging from the Cambridge Footlights in the 1960s, Cleese specialises in satire, black comedy, sketch comedy and surreal humour. With \"Yes Minister\" writer Antony Jay, he co-founded Video Arts, a production company making entertaining training films. In 1976, Cleese co-founded \"The Secret Policeman's Ball\" benefit shows to raise funds for the human rights organisation Amnesty International. Although a long-running supporter of the Liberal Democrats, in 1999 he turned down a life peerage offer from the party.\n\nCleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893–1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (\"née\" Cross, 1899–2000, the daughter of an auctioneer). His family's surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and used the name 'Cleese' when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War; he changed it officially by deed poll in 1923. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter's Preparatory School (paid for by money his mother inherited), where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing. When he was 13, he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College, an English public school in Bristol. He was already more than 6 feet (1.83 m) tall by then.\n\nCleese allegedly defaced the school grounds, as a prank, by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet. Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically, passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In his autobiography \"So, Anyway\", he says that discovering, aged 17, he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook: \"It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect ... I believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world.\"\n\nHe could not go straight to Cambridge, as the ending of National Service meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places, so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science, English, geography, history, and Latin (he drew on his Latin teaching experience later for a scene in \"Life of Brian\", in which he corrects Brian's badly written Latin graffiti). He then took up a place he had won at Downing College, Cambridge, to read Law. He also joined the Cambridge Footlights. He recalled that he went to the Cambridge Guildhall, where each university society had a stall, and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance. He replied \"no\" as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad, and if there was anything worse than his singing, it was his dancing. He was then asked \"Well, what do you do?\" to which he replied, \"I make people laugh.\"\n\nAt the Footlights theatrical club, he spent a lot of time with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie and met his future writing partner Graham Chapman. Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue \"I Thought I Saw It Move\", and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962. He was also in the cast of the 1962 Footlights Revue \"Double Take!\" Cleese graduated from Cambridge in 1963 with a . Despite his successes on \"The Frost Report\", his father would send him cuttings from \"The Daily Telegraph\" offering management jobs in places like Marks and Spencer.\n\nCleese was a scriptwriter, as well as a cast member, for the 1963 Footlights Revue \"A Clump of Plinths\". The revue was so successful at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe that it was renamed \"Cambridge Circus\" and taken to the West End in London and then on a tour of New Zealand and Broadway, with the cast also appearing in some of the revue's sketches on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in October 1964.\n\nAfter \"Cambridge Circus\", Cleese briefly stayed in America, performing on and off-Broadway. While performing in the musical \"Half a Sixpence\", Cleese met future Python Terry Gilliam, as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968. At their wedding at a Unitarian Church in Manhattan, the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language. \"The only moment of disappointment,\" Cleese recalled, \"came at the very end of the service when I discovered that I'd failed to excise one particular mention of the word 'God.'\" Later Booth would become a writing partner.\n\nHe was soon offered work as a writer with BBC Radio, where he worked on several programmes, most notably as a sketch writer for \"The Dick Emery Show\". The success of the Footlights Revue led to the recording of a short series of half-hour radio programmes, called \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", which were so popular that the BBC commissioned a regular series with the same title that ran from 1965 to 1974. Cleese returned to Britain and joined the cast. In many episodes, he is credited as \"John Otto Cleese\" (according to Jem Roberts, this may have been due to the embarrassment of his actual middle name Marwood).\n\nAlso in 1965, Cleese and Chapman began writing on \"The Frost Report\". The writing staff chosen for \"The Frost Report\" consisted of a number of writers and performers who would go on to make names for themselves in comedy. They included co-performers from \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\" and future Goodies Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor, and also Frank Muir, Barry Cryer, Marty Feldman, Ronnie Barker, Ronnie Corbett, Dick Vosburgh and future Python members Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. While working on \"The Frost Report\", the future Pythons developed the writing styles that would make their collaboration significant. Cleese's and Chapman's sketches often involved authority figures, some of whom were performed by Cleese, while Jones and Palin were both infatuated with filmed scenes that opened with idyllic countryside panoramas. Idle was one of those charged with writing David Frost's monologue. During this period Cleese met and befriended influential British comedian Peter Cook.\n\nIt was as a performer on \"The Frost Report\" that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic \"Class sketch\", contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, \"middle class\" Ronnie Barker and the even shorter, \"working class\" Ronnie Corbett. The British Film Institute commented, \"Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment.\" This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on \"At Last the 1948 Show\", during which time the \"Four Yorkshiremen sketch\" was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch). Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of \"Doctor in the House\" (and later Cleese wrote six episodes of \"Doctor at Large\" on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered their very own series. However, owing to Chapman's alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with just the two of them. He had found working with Palin on \"The Frost Report\" an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\" with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, on the back of the success of \"Do Not Adjust Your Set\", been offered a series for Thames Television, which they were waiting to begin when Cleese's offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.\n\n\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" ran for four seasons from October 1969 to December 1974 on BBC Television, though Cleese quit the show after the third. Cleese's two primary characterisations were as a sophisticated and a stressed-out loony. He portrayed the former as a series of announcers, TV show hosts, and government officials (for example, \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\"). The latter is perhaps best represented in the \"Cheese Shop\" and by Cleese's Mr Praline character, the man with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot and a menagerie of other animals all named \"Eric\". He was also known for his working class \"Sergeant Major\" character, who worked as a Police Sergeant, Roman Centurion, etc. Cleese also appeared during some abrupt scene changes where (usually outfitted in a dinner suit) he would come in as a radio commentator and, in a rather pompous manner, make the formal and determined announcement \"And now for something completely different\", which later became the title of the first Monty Python film.\n\nAlong with Gilliam's animations, Cleese's work with Graham Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of Basil Fawlty.\n\nUnlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman wrote together in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved him doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level. A classic example of this is the \"Dead Parrot sketch\", envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car (this version was actually performed and broadcast on the pre-Python special \"How to Irritate People\"). It was Chapman's suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a \"Norwegian Blue\", giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable.\n\nTheir humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleese's poker face, clipped middle class accent, and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers or government officials—which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the \"Ministry of Silly Walks\" sketch (actually written by Palin and Jones), Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office. On the Silly Walks sketch, Ben Beaumont-Thomas in \"The Guardian\" writes, “Cleese is utterly deadpan as he takes the stereotypical bowler-hatted political drone and ruthlessly skewers him. All the self-importance, bureaucratic inefficiency and laughable circuitousness of Whitehall is summed up in one balletic extension of his slender leg.”\nChapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the \"cheese shop\", the \"dead parrot\" sketch and \"Argument Clinic\", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in \"Fish Licence\", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.\n\nThough \"Flying Circus\" lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman's alcoholism. He felt, too, that the show's scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. He remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Much of his work on \"Holy Grail\" remains widely quoted, including the Black Knight scene. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in two further Monty Python films, \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" and \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\". His attack on Roman rule in \"Life of Brian\" – where he asks \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\", before being met with a string of benefits including sanitation, roads and public order – was ranked the seventh funniest line in film in a 2002 poll. Since the last Python film (\"Meaning of Life\" in 1983) Cleese has participated in various live performances with the group over the years.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Cleese served as rector of the University of St Andrews. His election proved a milestone for the university, revolutionising and modernising the post. For instance, the rector was traditionally entitled to appoint an \"Assessor\", a deputy to sit in his place at important meetings in his absence. Cleese changed this into a position for a student, elected across campus by the student body, resulting in direct access and representation for the student body.\n\nAround this time, Cleese worked with comedian Les Dawson on his sketch/stand-up show \"Sez Les\". The differences between the two physically (the tall, lean Cleese and the short, stout Dawson) and socially (the public school, and then Cambridge-educated Cleese and the working class, self-educated Mancunian Dawson) were marked, but both worked well together from series 8 onwards until the series ended in 1976.\n\nIn December 1977, Cleese appeared as a guest star on \"The Muppet Show\". Cleese was a fan of the show and co-wrote much of the episode. Cleese also made a cameo appearance in their 1981 film \"The Great Muppet Caper\" and won the \"TV Times\" award for Funniest Man on TV – 1978–79. In 1979, he starred in a TV special, \"To Norway, Home of Giants,\" produced by Johnny Bergh.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Cleese also produced and acted in a number of successful business training films, including \"Meetings, Bloody Meetings,\" and \"More Bloody Meetings\". These were produced by his company Video Arts.\n\nCleese achieved greater prominence in the United Kingdom as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in \"Fawlty Towers\", which he co-wrote with his wife Connie Booth. The series won three BAFTA awards when produced and in 2000, it topped the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 Basil Fawlty was ranked second (behind Homer Simpson) on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. The series also featured Prunella Scales as Basil's acerbic wife Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the much abused Spanish waiter Manuel, and Booth as waitress Polly, the series' voice of sanity. Cleese based Basil Fawlty on a real person, Donald Sinclair, whom he had encountered in 1970 while the Monty Python team were staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay while filming inserts for their television series. Reportedly, Cleese was inspired by Sinclair's mantra, \"I could run this hotel just fine if it weren't for the guests.\" He later described Sinclair as \"the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met,\" although Sinclair's widow has said her husband was totally misrepresented in the series. During the Pythons' stay, Sinclair allegedly threw Idle's briefcase out of the hotel \"in case it contained a bomb,\" complained about Gilliam's \"American\" table manners, and threw a bus timetable at another guest after they dared to ask the time of the next bus to town.\n\nThe first series was screened from 19 September 1975 on BBC 2, initially to poor reviews, but gained momentum when repeated on BBC 1 the following year. Despite this, a second series did not air until 1979, by which time Cleese's marriage to Booth had ended, but they revived their collaboration for the second series. \"Fawlty Towers\" consisted of two seasons, each of only six episodes; Cleese and Booth both maintain that this was to avoid compromising the quality of the series. The popularity of \"Fawlty Towers\" has endured, and in addition to featuring high in greatest ever television show polls it is often re-broadcast. In a 2002 poll, Basil's “don't mention the war” comment (said to the waitress Polly about the German guests) was ranked the second funniest line in television.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Cleese focused on film, though he did work with Peter Cook in his one-off TV special \"Peter Cook and Co.\" in 1980. In the same year, Cleese played Petruchio, in Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" in the BBC Television Shakespeare series. In 1981 he starred with Sean Connery and Michael Palin in the Terry Gilliam-directed \"Time Bandits\" as Robin Hood. He also participated in \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" (filmed 1980, released 1982) and starred in \"The Secret Policeman's Ball\" for Amnesty International. In 1985, Cleese had a small dramatic role as a sheriff in \"Silverado\", which had an all-star cast that included Kevin Kline, with whom he would star in \"A Fish Called Wanda\" three years later. In 1986, he starred in \"Clockwise\" as an uptight school headmaster obsessed with punctuality and constantly getting into trouble during a journey to speak at the Headmasters' Conference. Timed with the 1987 UK elections, he appeared in a video promoting proportional representation.\nIn 1988, he wrote and starred in \"A Fish Called Wanda\" as the lead, Archie Leach, along with Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin. \"Wanda\" was a commercial and critical success, and Cleese was nominated for an Academy Award for his script. Cynthia Cleese starred as Leach's daughter. Graham Chapman was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1989; Cleese, Michael Palin, Peter Cook, and Chapman's partner David Sherlock, witnessed Chapman's death. Chapman's death occurred a day before the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of \"Flying Circus\", with Jones commenting, \"the worst case of party-pooping in all history.\" Cleese gave a eulogy at Chapman's memorial service.\n\nCleese would later play a supporting role in Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" (1994) alongside Branagh himself and Robert De Niro. With Robin Skynner, the group analyst and family therapist, Cleese wrote two books on relationships: \"Families and How to Survive Them\", and \"Life and How to Survive It\". The books are presented as a dialogue between Skynner and Cleese.\n\nThe follow-up to \"A Fish Called Wanda\", \"Fierce Creatures\"—which again starred Cleese alongside Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin—was released in 1997, but was greeted with mixed reception by critics and audiences. Cleese has since often stated that making the second film had been a mistake. When asked by his friend, director and restaurant critic Michael Winner, what he would do differently if he could live his life again, Cleese responded, \"I wouldn't have married Alyce Faye Eichelberger and I wouldn't have made \"Fierce Creatures\".\"\n\nIn 1999, Cleese appeared in the James Bond film, \"The World Is Not Enough\" as Q's assistant, referred to by Bond as \"R\". In 2002, when Cleese reprised his role in \"Die Another Day\", the character was promoted, making Cleese the new quartermaster (Q) of MI6. In 2004, Cleese was featured as Q in the video game \"\", featuring his likeness and voice. Cleese did not appear in the subsequent Bond films, \"Casino Royale\", \"Quantum of Solace\" and \"Skyfall\"; in the latter film, Ben Whishaw was cast in the role of Q.\n\nCleese is Provost's Visiting Professor at Cornell University, after having been Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large from 1999 to 2006. He makes occasional well-received appearances on the Cornell campus. In 2001, Cleese was cast in the comedy \"Rat Race\" as the eccentric hotel owner Donald P. Sinclair, the name of the Torquay hotel owner on whom he had based the character of Basil Fawlty. In 2002, Cleese made a cameo appearance in the film \"The Adventures of Pluto Nash\" in which he played \"James\", a computerised chauffeur of a hover car stolen by the title character (played by Eddie Murphy). The vehicle is subsequently destroyed in a chase, leaving the chauffeur stranded in a remote place on the moon. In 2003, Cleese appeared as Lyle Finster on the US sitcom \"Will & Grace\". His character's daughter, Lorraine, was played by Minnie Driver. In the series, Lyle Finster briefly marries Karen Walker (Megan Mullally). In 2004, Cleese was credited as co-writer of a DC Comics graphic novel titled \"\". Part of DC's \"Elseworlds\" line of imaginary stories, \"True Brit\", mostly written by Kim Howard Johnson, suggests what might have happened had Superman's rocket ship landed in Britain, not America.\n\nFrom 10 November to 9 December 2005, Cleese toured New Zealand with his stage show, \"John Cleese—His Life, Times and Current Medical Problems\". Cleese described it as \"a one-man show with several people in it, which pushes the envelope of acceptable behaviour in new and disgusting ways\". The show was developed in New York City with William Goldman and includes Cleese's daughter Camilla as a writer and actor (the shows were directed by Australian Bille Brown). His assistant of many years, Garry Scott-Irvine, also appeared and was listed as a co-producer. The show then played in universities in California and Arizona from 10 January to 25 March 2006 under the title \"Seven Ways to Skin an Ocelot\". His voice can be downloaded for directional guidance purposes as a downloadable option on some personal GPS-navigation device models by company TomTom.\n\nIn a 2005 poll of comedians and comedy insiders, \"The Comedians' Comedian\", Cleese was voted second to Peter Cook. Also in 2005, a long-standing piece of Internet humour, \"The Revocation of Independence of the United States\", was wrongly attributed to Cleese. In 2006, Cleese hosted a television special of football's greatest kicks, goals, saves, bloopers, plays, and penalties, as well as football's influence on culture (including the famous Monty Python sketch \"Philosophy Football\"), featuring interviews with pop culture icons Dave Stewart, Dennis Hopper, and Henry Kissinger, as well as eminent footballers including Pelé, Mia Hamm, and Thierry Henry. \"The Art of Soccer with John Cleese\" was released in North America on DVD in January 2009 by BFS Entertainment & Multimedia. Also in 2006, Cleese released the song \"Don't Mention the World Cup\".\n\nCleese lent his voice to the BioWare video game \"Jade Empire\". His role was that of an \"outlander\" named Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard, stranded in the Imperial City of the Jade Empire. His character is essentially a British colonialist stereotype who refers to the people of the Jade Empire as \"savages in need of enlightenment\". His armour has the design of a fork stuck in a piece of cheese. In 2007, Cleese appeared in ads for Titleist as a golf course designer named \"Ian MacCallister\", who represents \"Golf Designers Against Distance\". Also in 2007, he started filming the sequel to \"The Pink Panther\", titled \"The Pink Panther 2\", with Steve Martin and Aishwarya Rai.\n\nCleese collaborated with Los Angeles Guitar Quartet member William Kanengiser in 2008 on the text to the performance piece \"The Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha\". Cleese, as narrator, and the LAGQ premiered the work in Santa Barbara. 2008 also saw reports of Cleese working on a musical version of \"A Fish Called Wanda\" with his daughter Camilla.\n\nAt the end of March 2009, Cleese published his first article as \"Contributing Editor\" to \"The Spectator\": \"The real reason I had to join \"The Spectator\"\". Cleese has also hosted comedy galas at the Montreal Just for Laughs comedy festival in 2006, and again in 2009. Towards the end of 2009 and into 2010, Cleese appeared in a series of television adverts for the Norwegian electric goods shop chain, Elkjøp. In March 2010 it was announced that Cleese would be playing Jasper in the video game \"Fable III\".\nIn 2009 and 2010, Cleese toured Scandinavia and the US with his Alimony Tour Year One and Year Two. In May 2010, it was announced that this tour would extend to the UK (his first tour in the UK), set for May 2011. The show is dubbed the \"Alimony Tour\" in reference to the financial implications of Cleese's divorce. The UK tour started in Cambridge on 3 May, visiting Birmingham, Nottingham, Salford, York, Liverpool, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Oxford, Bristol and Bath (the Alimony Tour DVD was recorded on 2 July, the final Bath date). Later in 2011 John took his Alimony Tour to South Africa. He played Cape Town on the 21 & 22 October before moving over to Johannesburg where he played from 25 to 30 October. In January 2012 he took his one-man show to Australia, starting in Perth on 22 Jan and throughout the next 4 months visited Adelaide, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Newcastle, New South Wales, Melbourne, Sydney, and finished up during April in Canberra.\n\nIn October 2010, Cleese was featured in the launch of an advertising campaign by The Automobile Association for a new home emergency response product. He appeared as a man who believed the AA could not help him during a series of disasters, including water pouring through his ceiling, with the line \"The AA? For faulty showers?\" During 2010, Cleese appeared in a series of radio advertisements for the Canadian insurance company Pacific Blue Cross, in which he plays a character called \"Dr. Nigel Bilkington, Chief of Medicine for American General Hospital\".\n\nIn 2012, Cleese was cast in \"Hunting Elephants\", a heist comedy by Israeli filmmaker Reshef Levi. Cleese had to quit just prior to filming due to heart trouble and was replaced by Patrick Stewart. Between September and October 2013, Cleese embarked on his first-ever cross-Canada comedy tour. Entitled \"John Cleese: Last Time to See Me Before I Die tour\", he visited Halifax, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Victoria and finished in Vancouver, performing to mostly sold-out venues. Cleese returned to the stage in Dubai in November 2013, where he performed to a sold-out theatre.\n\nCleese was interviewed and appears as himself in filmmaker Gracie Otto's 2013 documentary film \"The Last Impresario\", about Cleese's longtime friend and colleague Michael White. White produced \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" and Cleese's pre-Python comedy production \"Cambridge Circus\". At a comic press conference in November 2013, Cleese and other surviving members of the Monty Python comedy group announced a reuniting performance to be held in July 2014.\n\nCleese joined with Eric Idle in 2015 and 2016 for a tour of North America, Canada and the ANZUS nations, \"John Cleese & Eric Idle: Together Again At Last . . . For The Very First Time,\" playing small theatres and including interaction with audiences as well as sketches and reminisces. In a Reddit Ask Me Anything interview, Cleese expressed regret that he had turned down the role played by Robin Williams in \"The Birdcage\", the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in \"The Remains of the Day\", and the clergyman played by Peter Cook in \"The Princess Bride\".\n\nIn his \"Alimony Tour\" Cleese explained the origin of his fondness for black humour, the only thing that he inherited from his mother. Examples of it are the Dead Parrot sketch, \"The Kipper and the Corpse\" episode of \"Fawlty Towers\", his clip for the 1992 BBC2 mockumentary \"A Question of Taste\", the Undertakers sketch, and his eulogy at Graham Chapman's memorial service.\n\nCleese blamed his mother, who lived to the age of 101, for his problems in relationships with women, saying: \"It cannot be a coincidence that I spent such a large part of my life in some form of therapy and that the vast majority of the problems I was dealing with involved relationships with women.\"\n\nCleese (and the other members of Python) have contributed their services to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble, at other times as individuals. The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of Amnesty International via the \"Secret Policeman's Ball\" benefit shows. The idea of the \"Ball\" was conceived by Cleese, with \"Huffington Post\" stating “in 1976 he “friended” the then-struggling Amnesty International (according to Martin Lewis, the very notion of Human Rights was then not the domain of hipsters and students, but just of foreign-policy wonks) first with a cheque signed “J. Cleese” — and then by rounding up “a few friends” to put on a show.” Many musicians have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own benefit events—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Cleese and the rest of Python, such as Bob Geldof (organiser of Live Aid), U2, Pete Townshend, and Sting. On the impact of the Ball on Geldof, Sting states, “he took the ‘Ball’ and ran with it.”\n\nCleese is a long-standing supporter of the Liberal Democrats. Having previously been a Labour Party voter, Cleese switched to the SDP after their formation in 1981. During the 1987 general election, Cleese recorded a nine-minute party political broadcast for the SDP–Liberal Alliance, which spoke about the similarities and failures of the other two parties in a more humorous tone than standard political broadcasts. Cleese has since appeared in broadcasts for the Liberal Democrats, in the 1997 general election and narrating a radio election broadcast for the party during the 2001 general election.\n\nIn 2008, Cleese expressed support for Barack Obama and his presidential candidacy, offering his services as a speech writer. He was an outspoken critic of Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, saying that \"Michael Palin is no longer the funniest Palin\". The same year, he wrote a satirical poem about Fox News commentator Sean Hannity for \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\".\n\nIn 2011, Cleese declared his appreciation for Britain's coalition government between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, saying: \"I think what's happening at the moment is rather interesting. The Coalition has made everything a little more courteous and a little more flexible. I think it was quite good that the Liberal Democrats had to compromise a bit with the Tories.\" He also criticised the previous Labour government, commenting: \"Although my inclinations are slightly left-of-centre, I was terribly disappointed with the last Labour government. Gordon Brown lacked emotional intelligence and was never a leader.\" Cleese also declared his support for proportional representation.\n\nIn April 2011, Cleese said that he had declined a life peerage for political services in 1999. Outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats Paddy Ashdown had put forward the suggestion shortly before stepping down, with the idea that Cleese would take the party whip and sit as a working peer, but the actor quipped that he \"realised this involved being in England in the winter and I thought that was too much of a price to pay.\" Cleese also declined a CBE title in 1996 as he thought, \"they were silly.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2014, Cleese expressed political interest about the UK Independence Party, saying that although he was in doubt as to whether he was prepared to vote for it, he was attracted to its challenge to the established political order and the radicalism of its policies on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. He expressed support for immigration, but also concern about the integration of immigrants into British culture.\n\nTalking to \"Der Spiegel\" in 2015, Cleese expressed a critical view on what he saw as a plutocracy that was unhealthily developing control of the governance of the First World's societies, stating that he had reached a point when he \"saw that our existence here is absolutely hopeless. I see the rich have got a stranglehold on us. If somebody had said that to me when I was 20, I would have regarded him as a left-wing loony.\"\n\nIn 2016, Cleese publicly supported Brexit in the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. He tweeted: \"If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU, I'd vote to stay in. But there isn't. Sad.\" Cleese said that \"EU bureaucrats\" had taken away \"any trace of democratic accountability\" and suggested they should \"give up the euro, introduce accountability.\" In July 2018, Cleese said that he was leaving the UK to relocate to the Caribbean island of Nevis, partly over frustration around the standard of the Brexit debate, including \"dreadful lies\" by \"the right\" and a lack of reform regarding the press and the voting system. He emigrated to Nevis on 1 November 2018.\n\nDuring then-Republican nominee Donald Trump's run for the US Presidency in 2016, Cleese described Trump as \"a narcissist, with no attention span, who doesn't have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along\". He had previously described the leadership of the Republican Party as \"the most cynical, most disgracefully immoral people I've ever come across in a Western civilisation\".\n\nIn May 2019, Cleese repeated his previous statement that London was no longer an English city, saying \"virtually all my friends from abroad have confirmed my observation. So there must be some truth in it... I note also that London was the UK city that voted most strongly to remain in the EU.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan responded, \"These comments make John Cleese sound like he's in character as Basil Fawlty. Londoners know that our diversity is our greatest strength. We are proudly the English capital, a European city and a global hub.\" Cleese added, \"I suspect I should apologise for my affection for the Englishness of my upbringing, but in some ways I found it calmer, more polite, more humorous, less tabloid, and less money-oriented than the one that is replacing it.\"\n\nIn 1992, the UK Health Education Authority (subsequently the Health Development Agency, now merged into the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) recruited Cleese—an ex-smoker—to star in a series of anti-smoking public service announcements (PSAs) on British television, which took the form of sketches rife with morbid humor about smoking and were designed to encourage adult smokers to quit. In a controlled study of regions of central and northern England, one region received no intervention, the PSAs were broadcast in two regions, and one region received both the PSAs plus locally organised anti-tobacco campaigning. The study found that smokers in regions where the PSAs were broadcast were about half again as likely to have quit at the 18-month follow-up point as those who did not see them, irrespective of the local anti-tobacco campaign.\n\nCleese met Connie Booth in the US and they married in 1968. In 1971, Booth gave birth to Cynthia Cleese, their only child. With Booth, Cleese wrote the scripts for and co-starred in both series of \"Fawlty Towers\", even though the two were actually divorced before the second series was finished and aired. Cleese and Booth are said to have remained close friends since. Cleese has two grandchildren, Evan and Olivia, through his eldest daughter's marriage to Ed Solomon.\n\nCleese married American actress Barbara Trentham in 1981. Their daughter Camilla, Cleese's second child, was born in 1984. He and Trentham divorced in 1990. During this time, Cleese moved to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1992, he married American psychotherapist Alyce Faye Eichelberger. They divorced in 2008. The divorce settlement left Eichelberger with £12 million in finance and assets, including £600,000 a year for seven years. Cleese said, \"What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine ... I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship – such as children, or a conversation.\"\n\nLess than a year later, he returned to the UK, where he has property in London and a home on the Royal Crescent in Bath, Somerset. In August 2012, Cleese married English jewellery designer and former model Jennifer Wade in a ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\nIn March 2015, in an interview with \"Der Spiegel\", he was asked if he was religious. Cleese stated that he did not think much of organised religion and said he was not committed to \"anything except the vague feeling that there is something more going on than the materialist reductionist people think\".\n\nCleese has a passion for lemurs. Following the 1997 comedy film \"Fierce Creatures\", in which the ring-tailed lemur played a key role, he hosted the 1998 BBC documentary \"In the Wild: Operation Lemur with John Cleese\", which tracked the progress of a reintroduction of black-and-white ruffed lemurs back into the Betampona Reserve in Madagascar. The project had been partly funded by Cleese's donation of the proceeds from the London premier of \"Fierce Creatures\". Cleese is quoted as saying, \"I adore lemurs. They're extremely gentle, well-mannered, pretty and yet great fun ... I should have married one.\"\n\nThe Bemaraha woolly lemur (\"Avahi cleesei\"), also known as Cleese's woolly lemur, is native to western Madagascar. The scientist who discovered the species named it after Cleese, mainly because of Cleese's fondness for lemurs and his efforts at protecting and preserving them. The species was first discovered in 1990 by a team of scientists from Zurich University led by Urs Thalmann, but was not formally described as a species until 11 November 2005.\n\nOn 1 November, 2018, Cleese relocated to the island nation of Nevis in the Caribbean, where he feels \"life is safe and beautiful\" in comparison to present-day London.\n\n! scope=\"col\"  Year\n! scope=\"col\"  Title\n! scope=\"col\"  Role\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"  Notes\n\n2020\n\"Clifford The Big Red Dog\"\nTBA\nTBA\n\n!

{"id": "15870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15870", "title": "John Lynch (New Hampshire)", "text": "John Lynch (New Hampshire)\n\nJohn Harry Lynch (born November 25, 1952) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 80th Governor of New Hampshire from 2005 to 2013. Lynch was first elected governor in 2004, defeating first-term Republican incumbent Craig Benson – the first time a first-term incumbent New Hampshire governor was defeated for re-election in 78 years. Lynch won re-election in landslide victories in 2006 and 2008, and comfortably won a fourth term in 2010.\n\nLynch is the most popular governor in New Hampshire history and, while in office, consistently ranked among the nation's most popular governors.\n\nSince 2013, Lynch has served as a Senior Lecturer in the MBA program at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.\n\nLynch was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, the fifth of William and Margaret Lynch's six children. Lynch earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of New Hampshire in 1974, a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School, and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nDuring his business career, Lynch served as Director of Admissions at Harvard Business School and President of The Lynch Group, a business consulting firm in Manchester, New Hampshire. Lynch served as CEO of Knoll Inc., a national furniture manufacturer, where he transformed the company previously losing $50 million a year, to making a profits of nearly $240 million yearly. Under his leadership, Knoll created new jobs, gave factory workers annual bonuses, established a scholarship program for the children of employees, created retirement plans for employees who didn't have any, and gave workers stock in the company. Before announcing his run for governor, Lynch was serving as chairman of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees.\n\nIn June 2004, Lynch launched his campaign for Governor of New Hampshire.\n\nLynch spent the five months preceding the election relentlessly attacking Governor Craig Benson, the first-term Republican incumbent, for what Lynch claimed was a lack of integrity following a long series of scandals during Benson's tenure. Lynch accused Benson of creating a \"culture of corruption\" and cronyism at the State House.\n\nOn September 15, Lynch won the Democratic primary and on November 2, Lynch defeated Benson 51% to 49%.\n\nLynch was the first challenger to defeat a first-term incumbent in New Hampshire since 1926. On January 6, 2005, Lynch was inaugurated as the 80th Governor of New Hampshire. On November 7, 2006, Lynch was re-elected governor in a 74% to 26% landslide victory over Republican challenger Jim Coburn. Lynch's 74% of the vote was the largest margin of victory ever in a New Hampshire gubernatorial race.\n\nLynch's coattails carried his party to control of both chambers of the State Legislature and both of New Hampshire's two U.S. House seats.\n\nOn November 4, 2008, he was elected to a third term in another landslide victory. Lynch defeated Republican challenger Joseph Kenney, a New Hampshire state senator and U.S. Marine, 70% to 28%, with 2% of the vote won by the Libertarian candidate. Democrats maintained control of the state legislature and held both U.S. House seats, and gained a U.S. Senate seat.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, Lynch was elected to a historic fourth term as Governor of New Hampshire, in a victory over former State Health and Human Service's Commissioner John Stephen, 53% to 45%. Lynch was the only Democrat elected to statewide office. As had happened in many states throughout the U.S. during the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats suffered heavy losses. Democrats lost control of both chambers of the State Legislature, control of the Executive Council and both of the U.S. House seats.\n\nAccording to the Concord Monitor, when Lynch was inaugurated on January 6, 2011, he became \"the state's longest-serving governor in nearly two centuries. John Taylor Gilman was the last governor to serve longer than six years, serving 14 one-year terms as governor between 1794 and 1816. (The state switched to two-year terms in 1877)\" New Hampshire and neighboring Vermont are the only two States in the U.S. that use two-year terms.\n\nOn September 15, 2011, Lynch announced he would not seek a historic fifth term as governor.\n\nDuring the announcement Lynch said \"I feel like I have the passion and the energy to keep doing this work for a long, long time, but democracy demands periodic change. To refresh and revive itself, democracy needs new leaders and new ideas.\"\n\nOn January 3, 2013, Lynch was succeeded by fellow Democrat Maggie Hassan, marking the first time a Democrat succeeded a Democrat as the state's governor since the 19th century.\n\n!

In 2012, during his final State of the State address, Lynch proposed doubling the tax credit, citing its success in creating jobs, and slammed lawmakers for slashing funding to the state's community college system to fund a 10-cent reduction in the tobacco tax.\n\nIn June 2010, Lynch signed a budget-balancing measure that repealed the state's LLC tax.\n\nLynch worked with the state Attorney General, police chiefs, and lawmakers to pass sex offender laws; increase the state police force; and increase the number of state prosecutors. New Hampshire was rated the \"Safest State\" in the Nation in 2008 and 2009. New Hampshire again boasts the nation's lowest murder rate and the second-lowest rates for aggravated assault, according to \"CQ Press\". Lynch issued the following statement after the announcement of the award in 2009:\n\nLynch upheld the death penalty while in office, stating \"there are crimes so heinous that the death penalty is warranted.\" The New Hampshire House of Representatives passed legislation in March 2009 to abolish the death penalty, which Lynch threatened to veto. Due to the veto threat, the Senate tabled the legislation in April of that year. In June, Lynch compromised with legislators and signed legislation to form the New Hampshire Commission to Study the Death Penalty. In December 2010, the Commission recommended, by a 12 to 10 vote, to retain the death penalty. However, the panel unanimously recommended against expanding it. In 2011, Lynch signed legislation to expand the death penalty to include home invasions.\n\nIn April 2006, Lynch was awarded the \"National Chairman of Volunteers\" Award for Volunteer Excellence by the American Red Cross, due to his leadership during the 2005 floods.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, Lynch signed a same-sex marriage bill into law, despite being personally opposed to gay marriages, making New Hampshire the fifth state in the United States to allow such unions.\n\nThroughout his eight year tenure, Lynch enjoyed very high approval ratings, often being ranked among the most popular of U.S. governors. According to the WMUR/Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire, just three months after taking office in January 2005, Lynch's approval rating surpassed 50% and stayed upwards of 55% throughout his tenure. Likewise, between February 2006 and February 2009 his approval rating was above 70%. In April 2012, Lynch's approval rating was again above 70% making him the second most popular governor in the United States, behind New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Lynch enjoyed bipartisan support and is the most popular governor in the state's history.\n\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Lynch was one of eight superdelegates from New Hampshire. Lynch remained neutral during the New Hampshire primary because as governor he needed to \"focus on being a good host to the primary\", according to a statement by spokesman Colin Manning. At an event on June 27, 2008 in Unity, New Hampshire, Lynch formally endorsed Barack Obama for president.\n\nLynch endorsed President Barack Obama in the 2012 Presidential Election.\n\nLynch endorsed former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 Presidential Election.\n\nLynch endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\nLynch and his wife, Dr. Susan Lynch, a pediatrician and childhood obesity activist, reside in an home atop Gould Hill in Hopkinton, New Hampshire.
