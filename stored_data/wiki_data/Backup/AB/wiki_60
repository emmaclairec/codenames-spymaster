There are 364 days remaining until the end of the year (365 in leap years). This day is known as New Year's Day since the day marks the beginning of the year. It is also the first day of the first quarter of the year and the first half of the year. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages under the influence of the Catholic Church, many countries in western Europe decided to move the start of the year to one of several important Christian festivals – December 25 (the Nativity of Jesus), March 1, March 25 (the Annunciation), or even Easter. The Byzantine Empire began its numbered year on September 1.\n\nIn England, January 1 was celebrated as the New Year festival, but from the 12th century to 1752 the year in England began on March 25 (Lady Day). So, for example, the Parliamentary record notes the execution of Charles I as occurring on January 30, 1648, (as the year did not end until March 24), although modern histories adjust the start of the year to January 1 and record the execution as occurring in 1649.\n\nMost western European countries changed the start of the year to January 1 before they adopted the Gregorian calendar. For example, Scotland changed the start of the Scottish New Year to January 1 in 1600. England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of the year to January 1 in 1752. Later that year in September, the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies. These two reforms were implemented by the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750.\n\nJanuary 1 became the official start of the year as follows:\n\nJulian calendar:\nBULLET::::- 1362 Grand Duchy of Lithuania\nBULLET::::- 1544 Holy Roman Empire (Germany)\nBULLET::::- 1556 Spain, Portugal\nBULLET::::- 1559 Prussia, Sweden\nBULLET::::- 1564 France\nBULLET::::- 1576 Southern Netherlands\nBULLET::::- 1579 Duchy of Lorraine\nBULLET::::- 1583 Northern Netherlands\nBULLET::::- 1600 Scotland\nBULLET::::- 1700 Russia\nBULLET::::- 1752 Great Britain (excluding Scotland) and its colonies\nBULLET::::- 1804 Serbia\nGregorian calendar:\nBULLET::::- 1750 Tuscany\nBULLET::::- 1797 Republic of Venice\nBULLET::::- 1918 Ottoman Empire\nBULLET::::- 1941 Thailand\n\nBULLET::::- 153 BC – For the first time, Roman consuls begin their year in office on January 1.\n\nBULLET::::- 45 BC – The Julian calendar takes effect as the civil calendar of the Roman Empire, establishing January 1 as the new date of the new year.\nBULLET::::- 42 BC – The Roman Senate posthumously deifies Julius Caesar.\n\nBULLET::::- 193 – The Senate chooses Pertinax against his will to succeed Commodus as Roman emperor.\nBULLET::::- 404 – Saint Telemachus tries to stop a gladiatorial fight in a Roman amphitheatre, and is stoned to death by the crowd.

{"id": "15807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15807", "title": "John Horton Conway", "text": "John Horton Conway\n\nJohn Horton Conway (born 26 December 1937) is an English mathematician active in the theory of finite groups, knot theory, number theory, combinatorial game theory and coding theory. He has also made contributions to many branches of recreational mathematics, most notably the invention of the cellular automaton called the Game of Life. Conway spent the first half of his long career at the University of Cambridge, in England, and the second half at Princeton University in New Jersey, where he now holds the title John von Neumann Professor Emeritus.\n\nConway was born in Liverpool, the son of Cyril Horton Conway and Agnes Boyce. He became interested in mathematics at a very early age; his mother has recalled that he could recite the powers of two when he was four years old. By the age of eleven his ambition was to become a mathematician.\n\nAfter leaving sixth form, Conway entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to study mathematics. Conway, who was a \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, interpreted his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into a new person: an \"extrovert\".\n\nHe was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1959 and began to undertake research in number theory supervised by Harold Davenport. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals. It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room. He was awarded his doctorate in 1964 and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.\n\nConway is especially known for the invention of the Game of Life, one of the early examples of a cellular automaton. His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed.\n\nSince the game was introduced by Martin Gardner in \"Scientific American\" in 1970, it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles. It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive wiki devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game. From the earliest days it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. At times Conway has said he hates the Game of Life–largely because it has come to overshadow some of the other deeper and more important things he has done. Nevertheless, the game did help launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata.\n\nThe Game of Life is now known to be Turing complete.\n\nConway's career is intertwined with that of mathematics popularizer and \"Scientific American\" columnist Martin Gardner. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his Mathematical Games column in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity. Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work. For instance, he discussed Conway's game of Sprouts (Jul 1967), Hackenbush (Jan 1972), and his angel and devil problem (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column he reviewed Conway's book \"On Numbers and Games\" and even managed to explain Conway's surreal numbers. \n\nConway was probably the most important member of Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine. He\nregularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit Gardner pretty much held him prisoner for a week, pumping him for information on the Penrose tilings which had just been announced.  Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings. Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column. The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.\n\nConferences called Gathering 4 Gardner are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself has often been a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.\n\nConway is widely known for his contributions to combinatorial game theory (CGT), a theory of partisan games. This he developed with Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy, and with them also co-authored the book \"Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays\". He also wrote the book \"On Numbers and Games\" (\"ONAG\") which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of sprouts, as well as philosopher's football. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the Soma cube, peg solitaire, and Conway's soldiers. He came up with the angel problem, which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the surreal numbers, which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by Donald Knuth. He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly large numbers, the Conway chained arrow notation. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of \"ONAG\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s with Michael Guy, son of Richard Guy, Conway established that there are sixty-four convex uniform polychora excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the grand antiprism in the process, the only non-Wythoffian uniform polychoron. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing polyhedra called Conway polyhedron notation.\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the Conway criterion which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the Leech lattice.\n\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the Alexander polynomial and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial. After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel knot polynomials. Conway further developed tangle theory and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as Conway notation, while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings. See Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.\n\nHe was the primary author of the \"ATLAS of Finite Groups\" giving properties of many finite simple groups. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and Simon P. Norton he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the sporadic groups. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the Leech lattice, which have been designated the Conway groups. This work made him a key player in the successful classification of the finite simple groups.\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician John McKay, Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as monstrous moonshine. This subject, named by Conway, relates the monster group with elliptic modular functions, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics–finite groups and complex function theory. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to string theory.\n\nConway introduced the Mathieu groupoid, an extension of the Mathieu group M to 13 points.\n\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a conjecture by Edward Waring, that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though Chen Jingrun solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.\n\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on quaternions and octonions. Together with Neil Sloane, he invented the icosians.\n\nHe invented a base 13 function as a counterexample to the converse of the intermediate value theorem: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a Darboux property but is \"not\" continuous.\n\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the Doomsday algorithm. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on finite state machines.\n\nIn 2004, Conway and Simon B. Kochen, another Princeton mathematician, proved the free will theorem, a startling version of the 'no hidden variables' principle of quantum mechanics. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles.\"\n\nConway received the Berwick Prize (1971), was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1981), was the first recipient of the Pólya Prize (LMS) (1987), won the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (1998) and received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (2000) of the American Mathematical Society.\nHis nomination, in 1981, reads: \n\nIn 2017 Conway was given honorary membership of the British Mathematical Association.\n\nBULLET::::- 2008 \"The symmetries of things\" (with Heidi Burgiel and Chaim Goodman-Strauss).

{"id": "15821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15821", "title": "Jack Lemmon", "text": "Jack Lemmon\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III (February 8, 1925 – June 27, 2001) was an American actor who was nominated for an Oscar eight times, winning twice. He starred in over 60 films, such as \"Mister Roberts\" (1955, for which he won the year's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), \"The Apartment\" (1960), \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962), \"Irma la Douce\" (1963), \"The Great Race\" (1965), \"The Odd Couple\" (1968, and its sequel \"The Odd Couple II\" (1998), both with frequent co-star Walter Matthau), \"Save the Tiger\" (1973, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Missing\" (1982), and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992).\n\nLemmon was born on February 8, 1925, in an elevator at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts. He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., the president of the Doughnut Corporation of America. John Uhler Lemmon II was of Irish heritage, and his son was raised Catholic. His parents had a difficult marriage, and separated permanently when Lemmon was 18, but never divorced. He attended John Ward Elementary School in Newton and the Rivers School in Weston, Massachusetts. Often unwell as a child, Lemmon had three significant operations on his ears before he turned 10. He had spent two years in hospital by the time he turned 12.\n\nDuring his acceptance of his lifetime achievement award, he stated that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. He began to act in school productions. Lemmon attended Rivers Country Day School and Phillips Andover Academy (Class of 1943), where he pursued track sports with success, and Harvard College (Class of 1947), where he lived in Eliot House At Harvard, he was president of the Hasty Pudding Club and vice-president of Dramatic and Delphic Clubs. Except for drama and music, however, he was an unexceptional student. Forbidden to act in theatres, Lemmon broke Harvard rules to appear in roles using pseudonyms like Timothy Orange.\n\nHe was also a member of the V-12 Navy College Training Program and Lemmon was commissioned by the United States Navy, serving briefly as an ensign on an aircraft carrier during World War II before returning to Harvard after completing his military service. After graduation with a degree in War Service Sciences in 1947, he studied acting under coach Uta Hagen at HB Studio in New York City. He was a pianist, who became devoted to the instrument aged 14 and learned to play by ear. For about a year in New York City, he worked unpaid as a waiter and master of ceremonies at the Old Knick bar on Second Avenue. He also played the piano at the venue.\n\nLemmon became a professional actor, working on radio and Broadway. His film debut was a bit part as a plasterer in the film \"The Lady Takes a Sailor\" (1949), but he was already appearing in television shows, which numbered about 400 from 1948 to 1953.\n\nLemmon believed his stage career was about to take off when he was appearing on Broadway for the first time in a 1953 revival of the comedy \"Room Service\", but the production closed after two weeks. Despite this setback, he was spotted by talent scout Max Arnow, who was then working for Columbia, and Lemmon's focus shifted to films and Hollywood. Columbia's head Harry Cohn wanted to change Lemmon's name, in case it was used to describe the quality of the actor's films, but he successfully resisted.\n\nHis first role as a leading man was in the comedy \"It Should Happen to You\" (1954), which also featured the established Judy Holliday in the female lead. Bosley Crowther in his review for \"The New York Times\" described Lemmon as possessing \"a warm and appealing personality. The screen should see more of him.\" The two leads soon reunited in \"Phffft\" (also 1954). Kim Novak had a secondary role as a brief love interest for Lemmon's character. \"If it wasn't for Judy, I'm not sure I would have concentrated on films\", he told \"The Washington Post\" in 1986 saying early in his career he had a snobbish attitude towards films over the stage. He managed to negotiate a contract with Columbia allowing him leeway to pursue other projects, some of the terms of which he said \"nobody had gotten before\". He signed a seven-year contract, but ended staying with Columbia for ten years. Lemmon's appearance as Ensign Pulver in \"Mister Roberts\" (1955), with James Cagney and Henry Fonda, for Warner Bros. gained Lemmon the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Director John Ford decided to cast Lemmon after seeing his Columbia screen test, which had been directed by Richard Quine. At an impromptu meeting on the studio lot, Ford persuaded the actor to appear in the film, although Lemmon did not realise he was in conversation with Ford at the time.\n\nIn the military farce \"Operation Mad Ball\" (1957) set in a U.S. Army base in France after World War II, Lemmon played a calculating private. He met comedian Ernie Kovacs, who co-starred, and they became close friends, appearing together in two subsequent films, as a warlock in \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1958, a film he apparently disliked) and \"It Happened to Jane\" (1959), all three under the direction of Richard Quine. Lemmon starred in six films directed by Quine. The others were \"My Sister Eileen\" (1955), \"The Notorious Landlady\" (1962) and \"How to Murder Your Wife\" (1965).\nLemmon worked with Billy Wilder on seven films. Their association began with the director's \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), with Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. His role required him to perform 80% of the role in drag. People who knew his mother, Millie Lemmon, said he had mimicked her personality and even her hairstyle. The critic Pauline Kael said he was \"demoniacally funny\" in the part. The sequence of films with Wilder continued with \"The Apartment\" (1960) and \"Irma la Douce\" (1963), in which Lemmon co-starred with Shirley MacLaine. He was Oscar nominated for his roles in \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"The Apartment\". MacLaine, observing the director's relationship with his male lead, believed it amounted to \"professional infatuation\".\n\nLemmon's first role in a film directed by Blake Edwards was in \"Days of Wine and Roses\" (1962) portraying Joe Clay, a young alcoholic businessman. The role, for which he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, was one of Lemmon's favorite roles. By this time, he had appeared in 15 comedies, a western and an adventure film. \"The movie people put a label attached to your big toe — 'light comedy' — and that's the only way they think of you\", he commented in an interview during 1984. \"I knew damn well I could play drama. Things changed following \"Days of Wine and Roses\". That was as important a film as I've ever done.\" \"Days of Wine and Roses\" was the first film where Lemmon was involved with production of the film via his Jalam production company. Lemmon's association with Edwards continued with \"The Great Race\" (1965), which reunited him with Tony Curtis. His salary this time was $1 million, but the film did not return its large budget at the box-office.\n\nIn Wilder's \"The Fortune Cookie\" (1966), Lemmon first worked with actor Walter Matthau, which the British critic, Philip French, described as their \"one truly great film\". Another nine films with them co-starring eventually followed. Lemmon's production company Jalem produced \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967) with Paul Newman in the lead. Newman, in gratitude, offered him the role of the Sundance Kid in \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", but Lemmon turned it down.\n\nThe best known Lemmon-Matthau film is \"The Odd Couple\" (1968), based on the Neil Simon play, with the lead characters being the mismatched Felix Ungar (Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Matthau), respectively neurotical and cynical. The much admired comedy \"Kotch\" (1971), the only film Lemmon directed, starred Matthau who was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. \"The Out-of-Towners\" (1970) was another Neil Simon scripted film in which Lemmon appeared.\n\nLemmon starred with Juliet Mills in \"Avanti!\" (1972) and appeared with Matthau in \"The Front Page\" (1974). Both films were directed by Wilder. He felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography \"Nobody's Perfect\" quotes the director as saying, \"Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat.\" Wilder though also once said: \"Happiness is working with Jack Lemmon\".\n\nLemmon in \"Save the Tiger\" (1973) plays Harry Stoner, a businessman in the garment trade who finds someone to commit arson by burning down his warehouse to avoid bankruptcy. The project was rejected by multiple studios, but Paramount was prepared to make the film if it was budgeted for only $1 million. Lemmon was so keen to play the part that he worked for union scale, then $165 a week. The role was demanding, like the character Lemmon came close to breaking point: \"I started to crack as the character did,\" he recalled. \"I just kept getting deeper and deeper into the character's despair.\" For this film, Lemmon won the Best Actor Oscar. Having won the Best Supporting actor Academy Award for \"Mister Roberts\", he became the first actor to achieve a double, although Helen Hayes had achieved this feat three years earlier in the equivalent female categories.\n\nLemmon was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), for which he was also awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival. In \"Tribute\", a stage drama first performed in 1979, he played a press agent who has cancer while trying to mend his relationship with his son. The Broadway production ran for 212 performances, but it gained mixed reviews. Nevertheless, Lemmon was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. For his role in the 1980 film version, Lemmon gained another Oscar nomination.\n\nHis final Oscar nomination was for \"Missing\" (1982), as a conservative father whose son has vanished in Chile during the period the country was under the rule of Augusto Pinochet, he won another Cannes award for his performance. A contemporary failure was his last film with Billy Wilder, \"Buddy Buddy\" (1981). Lemmon's character attempts suicide in a hotel while a hitman (Matthau) in the next suite. Another flop at the box-office was his final film with Blake Edwards, another of his friends, was \"That's Life!\" (1986) in which he appeared in the director's self-autobiographical part with Edwards' wife, Julie Andrews. A seductress role was played by Lemmon's wife, Felicia Farr. His later career is said to have been affected by other bad choices, such as \"Mass Appeal\" (1984), about a conservative Catholic priest, \"Macaroni\" (1985), a tale about old Army friends with Marcello Mastroianni, and \"That's Life\". Lemmon received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1988.\n\nLemmon was nominated for a Tony Award the second and last time for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\" in 1986; Lemmon had taken the lead role of James Tyrone in a production directed by Jonathan Miller. It had a London run in 1987, Lemmon's first theatre work in the city, and a television version followed. A return to London in 1989 for the anti-war play \"Veterans' Day\", with Michael Gambon, was poorly received by critics and, following modest audiences, soon closed. As well as the production of \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", Lemmon also worked with Kevin Spacey in the films \"The Murder of Mary Phagan\" (1987), \"Dad\" (1989), and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992).\n\nLemmon and Matthau had small parts in Oliver Stone's film, \"JFK\" (1991) in which both men appeared without sharing screen time. The duo reunited in \"Grumpy Old Men\" (1993). The film was a surprise hit. Later in the decade, they starred together in \"The Grass Harp\" (1995), \"Grumpier Old Men\" (1995), \"Out to Sea\" (1997), and \"The Odd Couple II\" (1998). Both \"Grumpier Old Men\" and \"The Odd Couple II\" were box-office disappointments.\n\nIn 1996, Lemmon was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Or Non-Musical Album for his narration on \"Harry S Truman: A Journey To Independence\".\n\nFor his role in the William Friedkin directed version of \"Twelve Angry Men\" (1997), Lemmon was nominated for \"Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie\" in the 1998 Golden Globe Awards. The role was as the contentious juror, played in the original 1957 film version by Henry Fonda. Lemmon appeared in the remake with George C. Scott and reunited with him in another television film, this time \"Inherit the Wind\" (1999).\n\nLemmon was a guest voice on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The Twisted World of Marge Simpson\" (1997), as the owner of the pretzel business. For his role as Morrie Schwartz in his final television role, \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" (1999), Lemmon won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. His final film role was uncredited: the narrator in Robert Redford's film \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\".\n\nIn 1986 the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures gave Lemmon a \"Career Achievement\" award; two years later, the American Film Institute gave him its Lifetime Achievement Award in March 1988. In 1995 Lemmon was awarded the inaugural Harvard Arts Medal.\n\nIn 1996 Lemmon was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear award at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nLemmon was married twice. His first wife was actress Cynthia Stone, with whom he had a son, Chris Lemmon (born 1954), but the couple divorced over their incompatibility. He married his second wife, actress Felicia Farr, on August 17, 1962 in Paris while shooting \"Irma La Douce\". The couple's daughter, Courtney, was born in 1966. Farr had a daughter from her marriage to Lee Farr named Denise. Lemmon was a Catholic. He was close friends with actors Tony Curtis and Kevin Spacey, among others.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, Lemmon began to increase his drinking to cope with stress. He was fined for Driving under the influence (DUI) in 1976, finally quitting alcohol in the early 1980s. On a 1998 episode of the television program \"Inside the Actors Studio\", he stated that he was a recovering alcoholic.\n\nLemmon was known as the \"star\" of the celebrity-packed third round telecast of the annual AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links each February. Lemmon's packed gallery was there not only for his humor but also to root him on in his lifelong quest to \"make the cut\" to round 4, something he was never able to achieve. The amateur who helps his team most in the Pro-Am portion is annually awarded the Jack Lemmon Award.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Lemmon served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.\n\nLemmon was a registered Democrat.\n\nLemmon died of bladder cancer on June 27, 2001. He had suffered from the disease privately for two years before his death. His body was interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California. (The graves of Walter Matthau and film director Billy Wilder lie in the same cemetery.) Lemmon's gravestone reads like a title screen from a film: \"JACK LEMMON in\".\n\nAcademy Awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Result\n1955\n\n1959\n\n1960\nBest Actor\n\"The Apartment\"\n\n1962\nBest Actor\n\"Days of Wine and Roses\"\n\n1973\nBest Actor\n\"Save the Tiger\"\n\n1979\nBest Actor\n\"The China Syndrome\"\n\n1980\nBest Actor\n\"Tribute\"\n\n1982\nBest Actor\n\"Missing\"\n\nTony Awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Result\n1979\n\n1986\n\nEmmy Awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Result\n1972\n\n1975\n\n1987\nLead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special\n\"The Murder of Mary Phagan\"\n\n1997\nLead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special\n\"12 Angry Men\"\n\n1998\nLead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special\n\"Inherit the Wind\"\n\n1999\nLead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special\n\"Tuesdays with Morrie\"\n\nGrammy Awards\n!Year\n!Award\n!Nominated work\n!Result\n1996\n\nBULLET::::- Wise, James. \"Stars in Blue: Movie Actors in America's Sea Services\".
