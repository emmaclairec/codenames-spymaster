{"id": "17962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17962", "title": "Louis St. Laurent", "text": "Louis St. Laurent\n\nLouis Stephen St. Laurent (\"Saint-Laurent\" or \"St-Laurent\" in French, baptized Louis-Étienne St-Laurent; 1 February 1882 – 25 July 1973) was a Canadian politician who served as the 12th prime minister of Canada, from 15 November 1948 to 21 June 1957. He was a Liberal with a strong base in the Catholic francophone community, from which base he had long mobilised support to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. St. Laurent was an enthusiastic proponent of Canada's joining NATO in 1949 to fight the spread of Communism, overcoming opposition from some intellectuals, the Labor-Progressive Party, and many French Canadians. The contrast with Mackenzie King was not dramatic – they agreed on most policies. St. Laurent had more hatred of communism, and less fear of the United States. He was neither an idealist nor a bookish intellectual, but an \"eminently moderate, cautious ... man ... and a strong Canadian nationalist\".\n\nLouis St. Laurent () was born on 1 February 1882 in Compton, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships, to Jean-Baptiste-Moïse Saint-Laurent, a French Canadian, and Mary Anne Broderick, an Irish Canadian. He grew up fluently bilingual. His English had a noticeable Irish brogue, while his gestures (such as a hunch of the shoulders) were French.\n\nHe received degrees from Séminaire Saint-Charles-Borromée (B.A. 1902) and Université Laval (LL.L. 1905). He was offered, but declined, a Rhodes Scholarship upon this graduation from Laval in 1905. In 1908, he married Jeanne Renault (1886–1966), with whom he had two sons and three daughters, including Jean-Paul St. Laurent.\n\nSt-Laurent worked as a lawyer from 1905 to 1941, also becoming a professor of law at Université Laval in 1914. St-Laurent practised corporate and constitutional law in Quebec and became one of the country's most respected counsel. He served as President of the Canadian Bar Association from 1930 to 1932. In 1913 he was one of the defending counsel for Harry Kendall Thaw, who was seeking to avoid extradition from Quebec.\n\nSt-Laurent's father, a Compton shopkeeper, was a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada and was particularly enamoured with Sir Wilfrid Laurier. When Laurier led the Liberals to victory in the 1896 election, 14-year-old Louis relayed the election returns from the telephone in his father's store. However, while an ardent Liberal, Louis remained aloof from active politics for much of his life, focusing instead on his legal career and family. He became one of Quebec's leading lawyers and was so highly regarded that he was offered a position in the Cabinet of the Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in 1926 and was offered a seat as a justice in the Supreme Court of Canada; he declined both offers.\n\nIt was not until he was nearly 60 that St-Laurent finally agreed to enter politics when Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King appealed to his sense of duty in late 1941.\n\nFollowing the death of his Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, in November 1941, King was well aware of the need for the government to have a strong, well-respected member of cabinet to serve as a new deputy for Quebec to help deal with the volatile conscription issue. King had been in his political infancy when he witnessed the Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I and he wanted to prevent the same divisions from threatening his government. No Quebec or francophone members of King's cabinet or government were willing to step into the role, but many recommended St. Laurent to take the post instead. On these recommendations, King recruited St. Laurent to his World War II cabinet as Minister of Justice, Lapointe's former post, on 9 December. St. Laurent agreed to go to Ottawa out of a sense of duty, but only on the understanding that his foray into politics was temporary and that he would return to Quebec at the conclusion of the war. In February 1942, he won a by-election for Quebec East, Lapointe's former riding. St-Laurent supported King's decision to introduce conscription in 1944, despite the lack of support from other French Canadians (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). His support prevented more than a handful of Quebec Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) from leaving the party, and was therefore crucial to keeping the government and the party united.\n\nHe had to deal with the defection of Soviet cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko in Ottawa in September 1945; Gouzenko's revelations and subsequent investigations over the following few years showed major Soviet espionage in North America.\n\nKing came to regard St-Laurent as his most trusted minister and natural successor. He persuaded St-Laurent that it was his duty to remain in government following the war in order to help with the construction of a post-war international order and promoted him to the position of Secretary of State for External Affairs (foreign minister) in 1945, a portfolio King had previously always kept for himself. In this role, St-Laurent represented Canada at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and San Francisco Conference that led to the founding of the United Nations (UN).\n\nAt the conferences, St-Laurent, compelled by his belief that the UN would be ineffective in times of war and armed conflict without some military means to impose its will, advocated the adoption of a UN military force. This force he proposed would be used in situations that called for both tact and might to preserve peace or prevent combat. In 1956, this idea was actualized by St-Laurent and his Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson in the development of UN Peacekeepers that helped to put an end to the Suez Crisis.\n\nIn 1948,MacKenzie King retired, and quietly persuaded his senior ministers to support St-Laurent's selection as the new Liberal leader at the Liberal leadership convention of August 1948. St-Laurent won, and was sworn in as Prime Minister of Canada on 15 November, making him Canada's second French-Canadian Prime Minister, after Wilfrid Laurier.\n\nIn the 1949 federal election that followed his ascension to the Liberal leadership, many wondered, including Liberal party insiders, if St-Laurent would appeal to the post-war populace of Canada. On the campaign trail, St-Laurent's image was developed into somewhat of a 'character' and what is considered to be the first 'media image' to be used in Canadian politics. St-Laurent chatted with children, gave speeches in his shirt sleeves, and had a 'common touch' that turned out to be appealing to voters. At one event during the 1949 election campaign, he disembarked his train and instead of approaching the assembled crowd of adults and reporters, gravitated to, and began chatting with, a group of children on the platform. A reporter submitted an article entitled \"'Uncle Louis' can't lose!\" which earned him the nickname \"Uncle Louis\" in the media (Papa Louis in Quebec). With this common touch and broad appeal, he subsequently led the party to victory in the election against the Progressive Conservative Party led by George Drew. The Liberals won 190 seats—the most in Canadian history at the time, and still a record for the party.\n\nHis reputation as Prime Minister was impressive. He demanded hard work of all of his MPs and Ministers, and worked hard himself. He was reputed to be as knowledgeable on some ministerial portfolios as the ministers responsible themselves. To that end, Jack Pickersgill (a minister in St-Laurent's cabinet) said as prime minister St-Laurent had: \"as fine an intelligence as was ever applied to the problems of government in Canada. He left it a richer, a more generous and more united country than it had been before he became prime minister.\"\n\nSt-Laurent led the Liberals to another powerful majority in the 1953 federal election. While the Liberals lost several seats, they still had 111 more seats than the Tories, enabling them to dominate the House of Commons of Canada.\n\nSt-Laurent and his cabinet oversaw Canada's expanding international role in the postwar world. His stated desire was for Canada to occupy a social, military and economic middle power role in the post-World War II world. In 1947, he identified five basic principles of Canadian foreign policy and five practical applications regarding Canada's international relations. Always highly sensitive to cleavages of language, religion, and region, he stressed national unity, insisting, \"that our external policies shall not destroy our unity ... for a disunited Canada will be a powerless one.\" He also stressed political liberty and rule of law in the sense of opposition to totalitarianism.\n\nMilitarily, St-Laurent was a leading proponent of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, serving as an architect and signatory of the treaty document. Involvement in such an organization marked a departure from King who had been reticent about joining a military alliance. Under his leadership, Canada supported the United Nations (U.N.) in the Korean War and committed the third largest overall contribution of troops, ships and aircraft to the U.N. forces to the conflict. Troops to Korea were selected on a voluntary basis.\nIn 1956, under his direction, St-Laurent's Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester B. Pearson, helped solve the Suez Crisis in 1956 between Great Britain, France, Israel and Egypt, bringing forward St-Laurent's 1946 views on a U.N. military force in the form of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) or peacekeeping. It is widely believed that the activities directed by St-Laurent and Pearson could well have avoided a nuclear war. These actions were recognized when Pearson won the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSt-Laurent was an early supporter of British Prime Minister Clement Attlee's proposal to transform the British Commonwealth from a club of white dominions into a multi-racial partnership. The leaders of the other \"white dominions\" were less than enthusiastic. It was St-Laurent who drafted the London Declaration, recognizing King George VI as Head of the Commonwealth as a means of allowing India to remain in the international association once it became a republic.\n\nSt-Laurent's government was modestly progressive, fiscally conservative and run with business-like efficiency. Robertson says, \"St Laurent's administrations from 1949 to 1956 probably gave Canada the most consistently good, financially responsible, trouble-free government the country has had in its entire history.\"\n\nIt took taxation surpluses no longer needed by the wartime military and paying back in full Canada's debts accrued during the World Wars and the Great Depression. With remaining revenues, St-Laurent oversaw the expansion of Canada's social programs, including the gradual expansion of social welfare programs such as family allowances, old age pensions, government funding of university and post-secondary education and an early form of Medicare termed \"Hospital Insurance\" at the time. This scheme lay the groundwork for Tommy Douglas' healthcare system in Saskatchewan, and Pearson's nationwide universal healthcare in the late 1960s. Under this legislation, the federal government paid around 50% of the cost of provincial health plans to cover \"a basic range of inpatient services in acute, convalescent, and chronic hospital care.\" The condition for the cost-sharing agreements was that all citizens were to be entitled to these benefits, and by March 1963, 98.8 of Canadians were covered by \"Hospital Insurance\". According to historian Katherine Boothe, however, St. Laurent did not regard government health insurance to be a \"good policy idea\", instead favouring the expansion of voluntary insurance through existing plans. In 1951, for instance, St. Laurent spoke in support of the medical profession assuming \"the administration and responsibility for, a scheme that would provide prepaid medical attendance to any Canadian who needed it\".\n\nIn addition, St-Laurent modernized and established new social and industrial policies for the country during his time in the prime minister's office. Amongst these measures included the universalization of old-age pensions for all Canadians aged seventy and above (1951), the introduction of old age assistance for needy Canadians aged sixty-five and above (1951), the introduction of allowances for the blind (1951) and the disabled (1954), amendments to the National Housing Act (1954) which provided federal government financing to non-profit organisations as well as the provinces for the renovation or construction of hostels or housing for students, the disabled, the elderly, and families on low incomes, and unemployment assistance (1956) for unemployed employables on welfare who had exhausted (or did not qualify for) unemployment insurance benefits. During his last term as Prime Minister, St-Laurent's government used $100 million in death taxes to establish the Canada Council to support research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.\n\nIn 1949, the former lawyer of many Supreme Court cases, St-Laurent ended the practice of appealing Canadian legal cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Great Britain, making the Supreme Court of Canada the highest avenue of legal appeal available to Canadians. In that same year, St-Laurent negotiated the British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949 with Britain which 'partially patriated' the Canadian Constitution, most significantly giving the Canadian Parliament the authority to amend portions of the constitution. Also in 1949, following two referenda within the province, St-Laurent and Premier Joey Smallwood negotiated the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation.\n\nWhen asked in 1949 whether he would outlaw the Communist Party in Canada, St-Laurent responded that the party posed little threat and that such measures would be drastic.\n\nIn 1952, he advised Queen Elizabeth II to appoint Vincent Massey as the first Canadian-born Governor-General. Each of the aforementioned actions were and are seen as significant in furthering the cause of Canadian autonomy from Britain and developing a national identity on the international stage.\n\nIn 1956, using the Constitutional taxation authority of the federal level of government, St-Laurent's government introduced the policy of \"Equalization payments\" which redistributes taxation revenues between provinces to assist the poorer provinces in delivering government programs and services, a move that has been considered a strong one in solidifying the Canadian federation, particularly with his home province of Québec.\n\nThe government also engaged in massive public works and infrastructure projects such as building the Trans-Canada Highway (1949), the St. Lawrence Seaway (1954) and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. It was this last project that was to sow the seeds that led to the downfall of the St-Laurent government.\n\nSt-Laurent was initially very well received by the Canadian public, but by 1957, \"Uncle Louis\" (as he was sometimes referred to) began to appear tired, old and out of touch; he was 75 years old and had many hard years of work behind him. His government was also perceived to have grown too close to business interests. The 1956 Pipeline Debate led to the widespread impression that the Liberals had grown arrogant in power. On numerous occasions, the government invoked closure in order to curtail debate and ensure that its Pipeline Bill passed by a specific deadline. St. Laurent was criticized for a lack of restraint exercised on his minister C. D. Howe, who was widely perceived as extremely arrogant. Western Canadians felt particularly alienated by the government, believing that the Liberals were kowtowing to interests in Ontario and Quebec and the United States. (The opposition accused the government of accepting overly costly contracts that could never be completed on schedule. In the end, the pipeline was completed early and under budget.) The pipeline conflict turned out to be meaningless, insofar as the construction work was concerned, since pipe could not be obtained in 1956 from a striking American factory, and no work could have been done that year. The uproar in Parliament regarding the pipeline had a lasting impression on the electorate, and was a decisive factor in the Liberal government's 1957 defeat at the hands of the PCs, led by John Diefenbaker, in the 1957 election. Because the Liberals were still mostly classically liberal, Diefenbaker promised to outspend the incumbent Liberals, who campaigned on plans to stay the course of fiscal conservatism they had followed through St-Laurent's term in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nSt-Laurent was the first Prime Minister to live in the present official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada: 24 Sussex Drive, from 1951 to 1957, the end of his term in office.\nBy 1957 St. Laurent was 75 years old and tired. His party had been in power for 22 years, and by this time had accumulated too many factions and alienated too many groups. He was ready to retire, but was persuaded to fight one last campaign. In the 1957 election, the Liberals won 200,000 more votes nationwide than the Progressive Conservatives (40.75% Liberals to 38.81% PC). However, most of those votes were wasted with huge majorities in Quebec. Largely due to dominating the rest of the country, the Progressive Conservatives took the greatest number of seats with 112 seats (42% of the House) to the Liberals' 104 (39.2%). Some ministers wanted St. Laurent to stay on and offer to form a minority government, arguing that the popular vote had supported them and the party's long years of experience would make them a more effective minority.\n\nAnother option circulated within the party saw the balance of power to be held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and their 25 seats or Social Credit Party of Canada with their 15 seats. St-Laurent was encouraged by others to reach out to the CCF and at least four of six independent/small party MPs to form a coalition majority government, which would have held 134 of the 265 seats in Parliament—50.1% of the total. St. Laurent, however, had no desire to stay in office; he believed that the nation had passed a verdict against his government and his party. In any case, the CCF and Socreds had pledged to cooperate with a Tory government. It was very likely that St. Laurent would have been defeated on the floor of the House had he tried to stay in power with a minority government, and would not have stayed in office for long even if he survived that confidence vote. With this in mind, St. Laurent resigned on 21 June 1957—ending the longest uninterrupted run in government for a party at the federal level in Canadian history.\n\nSt-Laurent chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:\nBULLET::::- John Robert Cartwright (22 December 1949 – 23 March 1970)\nBULLET::::- Joseph Honoré Gérald Fauteux (22 December 1949 – 23 December 1973)\nBULLET::::- Douglas Charles Abbott (1 July 1954 – 23 December 1973)\nBULLET::::- Patrick Kerwin (as Chief Justice, 1 July 1954 – 2 February 1963; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister Richard Bennett, 20 July 1935)\nBULLET::::- Henry Grattan Nolan (1 March 1956 – 8 July 1957)\n\nAfter a short period as Leader of the Opposition and now more than 75 years old, St- Laurent's motivation to be involved in politics was gone. He announced his intention to retire from politics. St-Laurent was succeeded as Liberal Party leader by his former Secretary of State for External Affairs and representative at the United Nations, Lester B. Pearson, at the party's leadership convention in 1958.\n\nAfter his political retirement, he returned to practising law and living quietly and privately with his family. During his retirement, he was called into the public spotlight one final time in 1967 to be made a Companion of the Order of Canada, a newly created award.\n\nOrder of Canada citation\n\nSt. Laurent was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on 6 July 1967. His citation reads:\nFormer Prime Minister of Canada. For his service to his country.\n\nLouis Stephen St-Laurent died from heart failure on 25 July 1973, in Quebec City, Quebec, aged 91 and was buried at Saint Thomas d'Aquin Cemetery in his hometown of Compton, Quebec. He is survived by granddaughters Helen, Marie, Francine and grandsons Louis St-Laurent II and Michael S. O'Donnell.\n\nSt. Laurent was ranked #4 on a survey of the first 20 prime ministers (through Jean Chrétien) of Canada done by Canadian historians, and used by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in their book \"Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders\".\n\nThe house and grounds in Compton where St. Laurent was born were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973.

{"id": "17965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17965", "title": "Louis Leakey", "text": "Louis Leakey\n\nLouis Seymour Bazett Leakey (7 August 1903 – 1 October 1972) was a Kenyan paleoanthropologist and archaeologist whose work was important in demonstrating that humans evolved in Africa, particularly through discoveries made at Olduvai Gorge with his wife, fellow paleontologist Mary Leakey. Having established a program of palaeoanthropological inquiry in eastern Africa, he also motivated many future generations to continue this scholarly work. Several members of Leakey's family became prominent scholars themselves.\n\nAnother of Leakey's legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he saw as key to understanding human evolution. He personally focused on three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birutė Galdikas, calling them The Trimates. Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD. candidates, most notably from the University of Cambridge. Leakey also played a major role in creating organizations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there.\n\nLouis's parents, Harry (1868–1940) and Mary (May) Bazett Leakey (died 1948), were Church of England missionaries in British East Africa (now Kenya). Harry was the son of James Shirley Leakey (1824–1871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey. Harry Leakey was assigned to an established post of the Church Mission Society among the Kikuyu at Kabete, in the highlands north of Nairobi. The station was at that time a hut and two tents. Louis's earliest home had an earthen floor, a leaky thatched roof, rodents and insects, and no heating system except for charcoal braziers. The facilities slowly improved over time. The mission, a center of activity, set up a clinic in one of the tents, and later a girls' school. Harry was working on a translation of the Bible into the Gikuyu language. He had a distinguished career in the CMS, becoming canon of the station.\n\nLouis had a younger brother, Douglas, and two older sisters, Gladys and Julia. Both sisters married missionaries: Gladys married Leonard Beecher, Anglican Bishop of Mombasa and then Archbishop of East Africa from 1960 to 1970; Julia married Lawrence Barham, the second Bishop of Rwanda and Burundi from 1964 to 1966; their son Ken Barham was later the Bishop of Cyangugu in Rwanda.\n\nThe Leakey household came to contain Miss Oakes (a governess), Miss Higgenbotham (another missionary), and Mariamu (a Kikuyu nurse). Louis grew up, played, and learned to hunt with the native Kikuyus. He also learned to walk with the distinctive gait of the Kikuyu and speak their language fluently, as did his siblings. He was initiated into the Kikuyu ethnic group, an event of which he never spoke, as he was sworn to secrecy.\n\nLouis requested and was given permission to build and move into a hut, Kikuyu style, at the end of the garden. It was home to his personal collection of natural objects, such as birds' eggs and skulls. All the children developed a keen interest in and appreciation of the pristine natural surroundings in which they found themselves. They raised baby animals, later turning them over to zoos. Louis read a gift book, \"Days Before History\", by H. R. Hall (1907), a juvenile fictional work illustrating the prehistory of Britain. He began to collect tools and was further encouraged in this activity by a role model, Arthur Loveridge, first curator (1914) of the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, predecessor of the Coryndon Museum. This interest may have predisposed him toward a career in archaeology. His father was also a role model: Canon Leakey co-founded the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society.\n\nNeither Harry nor May were of strong constitution. From 1904–1906 the entire family lived at May's mother's house in Reading, Berkshire, England, while Harry recovered from neurasthenia, and again in 1911–1913, while May recovered from general frailty and exhaustion. During the latter stay, Harry bought a house in Boscombe, Hampshire.\n\nIn Britain, the Leakey children attended elementary school; in Africa, they had a tutor. The family sat out World War I in Africa. When the sea lanes opened again in 1919, they returned to Boscombe, where Louis was sent to Weymouth College, a private boys' school, when he was 16 years old. In three years there, he did not do well and complained of hazing and rules that he considered an infringement on his freedom. Advised by one teacher to seek employment in a bank, he secured help from an English teacher in applying to St John's College, Cambridge. He received a scholarship for his high scores on the entrance exams.\n\nLouis matriculated at the University of Cambridge, his father's alma mater, in 1922, intending to become a missionary to British East Africa.\n\nHe frequently told a story about his final exams. When he had arrived in Britain, he had notified the register that he was fluent in Swahili. When he came to his finals, he asked to be examined in this language, and the authorities agreed. Then one day, he received two letters. One instructed him to report at a certain time and place for a \"viva voce\" examination in Swahili. The other asked if, at the same time and place, he would examine a candidate in Swahili.\n\nIn 1922 the British had been awarded German East Africa as part of the settlement of World War I. Within the Tanganyika Territory the Germans had discovered a site rich in dinosaur fossils, Tendaguru. Louis was told by C. W. Hobley, a friend of the family, that the British Museum of Natural History was going to send a fossil-hunting expedition led by William E. Cutler to the site. Louis applied and was hired to locate the site and manage the administrative details. In 1924 they departed for Africa. They never found a complete dinosaur skeleton, and Louis was recalled from the site by Cambridge in 1925.\n\nLouis switched his focus to anthropology, and found a new mentor in Alfred Cort Haddon, head of the Cambridge department. In 1926, Louis graduated with a \"double first\", or high honours, in anthropology and archaeology. He had used some of his preexisting qualifications; for example, Kikuyu was offered and accepted as the second modern language in which he was required to be proficient, even though no one there could test him on it. The university accepted an affidavit from a Kikuyu chief signed with a thumbprint.\n\nFrom 1925 on Louis lectured and wrote on African archaeological and palaeontological topics. On graduation he was such a respected figure that Cambridge sent him to East Africa to study prehistoric African humans. He excavated dozens of sites, undertaking for the first time a systematic study of the artifacts. Some of his names for archaeological cultures are still in use; for example, the Elmenteitan.\n\nIn 1927, Louis received a visit at a site called Gamble's Cave, near Lake Elmenteita, by two women on a holiday, one of whom was Frida Avern (1902–1993). Avern had done some course work in archaeology. Louis and Frida began a relationship, which continued upon his return to Cambridge. In 1928, they married and continued work near Lake Elmenteita. Finds from Gamble's Cave were donated by Leakey to the British Museum in 1931. At that time he discovered the Acheulean site of Kariandusi, which he excavated in 1928.\n\nOn the strength of his work there, he obtained a post-graduate research fellowship at St. John's College and returned to Cambridge in 1929 to classify and prepare the finds from Elmenteita. His patron and mentor at Cambridge were now Arthur Keith. While cleaning two skeletons he had found, he noticed a similarity to one found in Olduvai Gorge by Professor Hans Reck, a German national, whom Louis had met in 1925 in Germany while on business for Keith. \n\nThe geology of Olduvai was known. In 1913, Reck had extricated a skeleton from Bed II in the gorge wall. He argued that it must have the date of the bed, which was believed to be 600,000 years, in the mid-Pleistocene. Early dates for human evolution were not widely accepted by the general public at the time. Reck became involved in a media uproar. He was barred from going back to settle the question by the war and then the terms of the transfer of Tanganyika from Germany to Britain. In 1929, Louis visited Berlin to talk to the now skeptical Reck. Noting an Acheulean tool in Reck's collection of artifacts from Olduvai, he bet Reck he could find ancient stone tools at Olduvai within 24 hours.\n\nLouis received his Ph.D. in 1930 at the age of 27. His first child, a daughter named Priscilla Muthoni Leakey, was born in 1931. His headaches and epilepsy returned, and he was prescribed Luminal, which he took for the rest of his life.\nIn November 1931, Louis led an expedition to Olduvai whose members included Reck, whom Louis allowed to enter the gorge first. Leakey had bet Reck that Leakey would find Acheulean tools within the first 24 hours, which he did. These verified the provenance of the 1913 find, now called Olduvai Man. Non-humanoid fossils and tools were extracted from the ground in large numbers. Frida delayed joining her husband and was less enthusiastic about him on behalf of Priscilla. She did arrive eventually, however, and Louis put her to work. Frida's site became FLK, for Frida Leakey's Karongo (\"gully\").\n\nBack in Cambridge, the skeptics were not impressed. To find supporting evidence of the antiquity of Reck's Olduvai Man, Louis returned to Africa, excavating at Kanam and Kanjera. He easily found more fossils, which he named Homo kanamensis. While he was gone, the opposition worked up some \"evidence\" of the intrusion of Olduvai Man into an earlier layer, evidence that seemed convincing at the time, but is missing and unverifiable now. On his return, Louis' finds were carefully examined by a committee of 26 scientists and were tentatively accepted as valid.\n\nWith Frida's dowry money, the Leakeys bought a large brick house in Girton near Cambridge, which they named \"The Close.\"\n\nFrida was now pregnant and suffered from morning sickness most of the time and was unable to work on the illustrations for Louis's second book, \"Adam's Ancestors.\" At a dinner party given in his honor after a lecture of his at the Royal Anthropological Institute, Gertrude Caton-Thompson introduced her own illustrator, the twenty-year-old Mary Nicol. Louis convinced Mary to take on the illustration of his book, and a few months later companionship turned to romance. Frida gave birth to Colin in December 1933, and the next month Louis asked her for a divorce. She would not sue for divorce until 1936.\n\nA panel at Cambridge investigated his morals. Grants dried up, but his mother raised enough money for another expedition to Olduvai, Kanam and Kanjera, the latter two on the Winam Gulf. His previous work there was questioned by P. G. H. Boswell, whom he invited to verify the sites for himself. Arriving at Kanam and Kanjera in 1935, they found that the iron markers Louis had used to mark the sites had been removed by the Luo tribe for use as harpoons and the sites could not now be located. To make matters worse, all the photos Louis took were ruined by a light leak in the camera. After an irritating and fruitless two-month search, Boswell left for England, promising, as Louis understood it, not to publish a word until Louis returned.\n\nBoswell immediately set out to publish as many words as he was able, beginning with a letter in \"Nature\" dated 9 March 1935, destroying Reck's and Louis's dates of the fossils and questioning Louis's competence. Despite the searches for the iron markers, Boswell averred that \"the earlier expedition (of 1931–32) neither marked the localities on the ground nor recorded the sites on a map.\" In a field report of March 1935, Louis accused Boswell of reneging on his word, but Boswell asserted he had made no such promise, and now having public opinion on his side, warned Louis to withdraw the claim. Louis was not only forced to retract the accusation in his final field report in June 1935, but also to recant his support of Reck. Louis was through at Cambridge. Even his mentors turned on him.\n\nMeeting Mary in Africa, he proceeded to Olduvai with a small party. Louis' parents continued to urge him to return to Frida, and would pay for everyone in the party but Mary. Mary joined him under a stigma but her skill and competence eventually won over the other participants. Louis and his associates did the groundwork for future excavation at Olduvai, uncovering dozens of sites for a broad sampling, as was his method. They were named after the excavator: SHK (Sam Howard's karongo), BK (Peter Bell's), SWK (Sam White's), MNK (Mary Nicol's). Louis and Mary conducted a temporary clinic for the Maasai, made preliminary investigations of Laetoli, and ended by studying the rock paintings at the Kisese/Cheke region.\n\nLouis and Mary returned to England in 1935 without positions or any place to stay except Mary's mother's apartment. They soon leased Steen Cottage in Great Munden. This settlement was in Hertfordshire and had an unusual name which Louis, with his sense of humor noted in his \"Memoirs\", Chapter 5, as \"the village of Nasty.\" They lived without heat, electricity, or plumbing, fetching water from a well and writing by oil lantern. They lived in poverty for 18 months at this low point of their fortunes, visited at first only by Mary's relatives. Louis gardened for subsistence and exercise and improved the house and grounds. He appealed at last to the Royal Society, who relented with a small grant to continue work on his collection.\n\nLouis had already involved himself in Kikuyu tribal affairs in 1928, taking a stand against female genital cutting. He got into a shouting match in Kikuyu one evening with Jomo Kenyatta, later the president of Kenya, who was lecturing on the topic. R. Copeland at Oxford recommended he apply to the Rhodes Trust for a grant to write a study of the Kikuyu and it was given late in 1936 along with a salary for two years. In January 1937 the Leakeys travelled to Kenya. Colin would not see his father for 20 years.\n\nLouis returned to Kiambaa near Nairobi and persuaded Senior Chief Koinange, who designated a committee of chiefs, to help him describe the Kikuyu the way they had been. Mary excavated at Waterfall Cave. She fell ill with double pneumonia and was near death for two weeks in the hospital in Nairobi, during which time her mother was sent for. Contrary to expectation, she recovered and began another excavation at Hyrax Hill and then Njoro River Cave. Louis got an extension of his grant, which he used partially for fossil-hunting. Leakey discoveries began to appear in the newspapers again.\n\nTensions between the Kikuyu and the settlers increased alarmingly. Louis jumped into the fray as an exponent of the middle ground. In \"Kenya: Contrasts and Problems\", he angered the settlers by proclaiming Kenya could never be a \"white man's country.\"\n\nThe government offered Louis work as a policeman in intelligence, which he accepted. He traveled the country as a pedlar, reporting on the talk. When Britain went to war in September 1939 the Kenyan government drafted Louis into its African intelligence service. Apart from some bumbling around, during which he and some settlers stalked each other as possible saboteurs of the Sagana Railway Bridge, his first task was to supply and arm Ethiopian guerrillas against the Italian invaders of their country. He created a clandestine network using his childhood friends among the Kikuyu. They also hunted fossils on the sly.\n\nLouis conducted interrogations, analyzed handwriting, wrote radio broadcasts and took on regular police investigations. He loved a good mystery of any sort. The white leadership of the King's African Rifles used him extensively to clear up many cultural mysteries; for example, he helped an officer remove a curse he had inadvertently put on his men.\n\nMary continued to find and excavate sites. Jonathan Leakey was born in 1940. She worked in the Coryndon Memorial Museum (later called the National Museums of Kenya) where Louis joined her as an unpaid honorary curator in 1941. Their life was a menage of police work and archaeology. They investigated Rusinga Island and Olorgesailie. At the latter site they were assisted by a team of Italian experts recruited from the prisoners of war and paroled for the purpose.\n\nIn 1942 the Italian menace ended, but the Japanese began to reconnoiter with a view toward landing in force. Louis found himself in counter-intelligence work, which he performed with zest and imagination. Deborah was born, but died at three months. They lived in a rundown and bug infested Nairobi home, provided by the museum. Jonathan was attacked by army ants in his crib.\n\nIn 1944 Richard Leakey was born. In 1945 the family's income from police work all but vanished. By now Louis was getting plenty of job offers but he chose to stay on in Kenya as Curator of the Coryndon Museum, with an annual salary and a house, but more importantly, to continue palaeoanthropological research.\n\nIn January 1947 Louis conducted the first Pan-African Congress of Prehistory at Nairobi. Sixty scientists from 26 countries attended, delivering papers and visiting the Leakey sites. The conference restored Louis to the scientific fold and made him a major figure in it. With the money that now poured in Louis undertook the famous expeditions of 1948 and beyond at Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, where Mary discovered the most complete Proconsul fossil up to that time.\n\nCharles Watson Boise donated money for a boat to be used for transport on Lake Victoria, \"The Miocene Lady\". Its skipper, Hassan Salimu, was later to deliver Jane Goodall to Gombe. Philip Leakey was born in 1949. In 1950, Louis was awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University.\n\nWhile the Leakeys were at Lake Victoria, the Kikuyu struck at the European settlers of the Kenyan highlands, who seemed to have the upper hand and were insisting on a \"white\" government of a \"white\" Africa. In 1949 the Kikuyu formed a secret society, the Mau Mau, which attacked settlers and especially loyalist Kikuyu.\n\nLouis had attempted to warn Sir Philip Mitchell, governor of the colony, that nocturnal meetings and forced oaths were not Kikuyu customs and foreboded violence, but was ignored. Now he found himself pulled away from anthropology to investigate the Mau Mau. During this period his life was threatened and a reward placed on his head. The Leakeys began to pack pistols, termed \"European National Dress.\" The government placed him under 24-hour guard.\n\nIn 1952, after a massacre of loyal chiefs, the government arrested Jomo Kenyatta, president of the Kenya African Union. Louis was summoned to be a court interpreter, but withdrew after an accusation of mistranslation because of prejudice against the defendant. He returned on request to translate documents only. Because of lack of evidence linking Kenyatta to the Mau Mau, although convicted, he did not receive the death penalty, but was sentenced to several years of hard labor and banned from Kenya.\n\nThe government brought in British troops and formed a home guard of 20,000 Kikuyu. During this time Louis played a difficult and contradictory role. He sided with the settlers, serving as their spokesman and intelligence officer, helping to ferret out bands of guerrillas. On the other hand, he continued to advocate for the Kikuyu in his 1954 book \"Defeating Mau Mau\" and numerous talks and articles. He recommended a multi-racial government, land reform in the highlands, a wage hike for the Kikuyu, and many other reforms, most of which were eventually adopted.\n\nThe British realized the rebellion was being directed from urban centers, instituted military law and rounded up the committees. Following Louis' suggestion, thousands of Kikuyu were placed in re-education camps and resettled in new villages. The rebellion continued from bases under Mt. Kenya until 1956, when, deprived of its leadership and supplies, it had to disperse. The state of emergency lasted until 1960. In 1963 Kenya became independent, with Jomo Kenyatta as prime minister.\n\nBeginning in 1951, Louis and Mary began intensive research at Olduvai Gorge. A trial trench in Bed II at BK in 1951 was followed by a more extensive excavation in 1952. They found what Louis termed an Oldowan \"slaughter-house\", an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered. Excavations stopped in 1953 but were briefly resumed in 1955 with Jean Brown.\n\nIn 1959, excavations at Bed I were opened. While Louis was sick in camp, Mary discovered the fossilized skull OH 5 at FLK, \"Paranthropus boisei\", famously identified as \"\"Zinjanthropus\"\" or \"Zinj.\" The question was whether the fossil belonged to a previous genus discovered by Robert Broom, \"Paranthropus\", or a member of a different genus ancestral to humans. Louis opted for \"Zinjanthropus\", a decision opposed by Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, but one which attracted the attention of Melville Bell Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society. That contact resulted in an article in \"National Geographic\" and a large grant to continue work at Olduvai.\n\nIn 1960, geophysicists Jack Evernden and Garniss Curtis dated Bed I from 1.89 to 1.75 million years ago, confirming the great antiquity of fossil hominids in Africa.\n\nIn 1960, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba assistants, including Kamoya Kimeu, who later discovered many of eastern Africa's most famous fossils. At Olduvai, Mary set up Camp 5 and began work with her own staff and associates.\n\nAt \"Jonny's site\", FLK-NN, Jonathan Leakey discovered two skull fragments without the Australopithecine sagittal crest, which Mary connected with Broom's and Robinson's \"Telanthropus\". The problem with it was its contemporaneity with \"Zinjanthropus\". When mailed photographs, Le Gros Clark retorted casually \"Shades of Piltdown.\" Louis cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion of his incompetence. Clark apologized.\n\nNot long afterwards, in 1960, Louis, his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil he termed \"Chellean Man\", (Olduvai Hominid 9), in context with Oldowan tools. After reconstruction Louis and Mary called it \"Pinhead.\" It was subsequently identified as \"Homo erectus\", contemporaneous with \"Paranthropus\" at 1.4 million years old.\n\nIn 1961 Louis got a salary as well as a grant from the National Geographic Society and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate. He created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds, moved his collections to it, and appointed himself director. This was his new operations center. He opened another excavation at Fort Ternan on Lake Victoria. Shortly after, Heselon discovered \"Kenyapithecus wickeri\", named after the owner of the property. Louis promptly celebrated with George Gaylord Simpson, who happened to be present, aboard the \"Miocene Lady\" with \"Leakey Safari Specials\", a drink made of condensed milk and cognac.\n\nIn 1962 Louis was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of \"Homo habilis\" at MNK. Louis and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella, or Cindy. Phillip Tobias identified Jonny's Child with it and Raymond Dart came up with the name \"Homo habilis\" at Louis' request, which Tobias translated as \"handyman.\" It was seen as intermediary between gracile \"Australopithecus\" and \"Homo\".\n\nIn 1959 Leakey, while at the British Museum of Natural History in London, received a visit from Ruth DeEtte Simpson, an archaeologist from California. Simpson had acquired what looked like ancient scrapers from a site in the Calico Hills and showed it to Leakey.\n\nIn 1963, Leakey obtained funds from the National Geographic Society and commenced archaeological excavations with Simpson. Excavations at the site carried out by Leakey and Simpson revealed that they had located stone artifacts which were dated 100,000 years or older, suggesting a human presence in North America much earlier than others had estimated.\n\nThe geologist Vance Haynes had made three visits to the site in 1973 and had claimed that the artifacts found by Leakey were naturally formed geofacts. According to Haynes, the geofacts were formed by stones becoming fractured in an ancient river on the site.\n\nIn her autobiography, Mary Leakey wrote that because of Louis's involvement with the Calico Hills site she had lost academic respect for him and that the Calico excavation project was \"catastrophic to his professional career and was largely responsible for the parting of our ways\".\n\nOne of Louis's greatest legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he understood as key to unraveling the mysteries of human evolution. He personally chose three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birute Galdikas, calling them The Trimates. Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology, immersing themselves in the study of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, respectively. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other Ph.D. candidates, most notably from Cambridge University.\n\nDuring his final years Louis became famous as a lecturer in the United Kingdom and United States. He did not excavate any longer, as he was crippled with arthritis, for which he had a hip replacement in 1968. He raised funds and directed his family and associates. In Kenya he was a facilitator for hundreds of scientists exploring the East African Rift system for fossils.\n\nIn 1968, Louis refused an honorary doctorate from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, primarily because of apartheid in South Africa. Mary accepted one, and thereafter led separate professional lives.\n\nIn the last few years Louis' health began to fail more seriously. He had his first heart attacks and spent six months in the hospital. An empathy over health brought him and Dian Fossey together for a brief romance, which she broke off. Richard began to assume more and more of his father's responsibilities, which Louis resisted, but in the end was forced to accept.\n\nOn 1 October 1972, Louis had a heart attack in Jane Goodall's apartment in London. Jane sat up all night with him in St. Stephen's Hospital and left at 9:00 a.m. He died 30 minutes later at the age of 69.\n\nMary wanted to cremate Louis and fly the ashes back to Nairobi. Richard intervened. Louis was flown home and interred at Limuru, near the graves of his parents.\n\nIn denial, the family did not face the question of a memorial marker for a year. When Richard went to place a stone on the grave he found one already there, courtesy of Louis' former secretary Rosalie Osborn. The inscription was signed with the letters, \"ILYFA\", \"I'll love you forever always\", which Rosalie used to place on her letters to him. Richard left it in place.\n\nBULLET::::- 1958. Louis founded the Tigoni Primate Research Center with Cynthia Booth, on her farm north of Nairobi. Later it was the National Primate Research Center, currently the Institute of Primate Research, now in Nairobi. As the Tigoni center, it funded Leakey's Angels.\nBULLET::::- 1961.

Found preserved in volcanic ash in Tanzania, they are the earliest record of bipedal gait.\n\nHe is also the father of paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey and the botanist Colin Leakey. Louis's cousin, Nigel Gray Leakey, was a recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II.\n\nLeakey's books are listed below. The gaps between books are filled by too many articles to list.

{"id": "17967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17967", "title": "Liar paradox", "text": "Liar paradox\n\nIn philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar's paradox or antinomy of the liar is the statement of a liar that he or she is lying: for instance, declaring that \"I am lying\". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar just lied. In \"this sentence is a lie\" the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar making the statement. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction.\n\nIf \"this sentence is false\" is true, then the sentence is false, but if the sentence states that it is false, and it is false, then it must be true, and so on.\n\nThe Epimenides paradox (circa 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical seer Epimenides, a Cretan, reportedly stated that \"All Cretans are liars.\" However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie. It is precisely in order to avoid uncertainties deriving from the human factor and from fuzzy concepts that modern logicians proposed a \"strengthened\" liar such as the sentence \"this sentence is false\". \n\nThe paradox's name translates as \"pseudómenos lógos\" (ψευδόμενος λόγος) in Ancient Greek. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides of Miletus who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, \"A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?\"\n\nThe paradox was once discussed by St. Jerome in a sermon:\n\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as \"everything I am saying is false\" (sarvam mithyā bravīmi). He analyzes this statement together with the paradox of \"unsignifiability\" and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.\n\nHowever, \"everything I say is false\" or \"I always lie\" are not paradoxes because these statements being untrue means that \"Not everything I say is false\" or \"I do not always lie\". It suggests that the speaker sometimes tells the truth but in this instance, they are not. Therefore, contrary to some people's beliefs, these statements are false.\n\nIn early Islamic tradition liar paradox was discussed for at least five centuries starting from late 9th century apparently without being influenced by any other tradition. Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī could have been the first logician to identify the liar paradox as self-referential.\n\nThe problem of the liar paradox is that it seems to show that common beliefs about truth and falsity actually lead to a contradiction. Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with grammar and semantic rules.\n\nThe simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:\n\nIf (A) is true, then \"This statement is false\" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.\n\nIf (A) is false, then \"This statement is false\" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.\n\nHowever, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is \"neither true nor false\". This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the principle of bivalence, a concept related to the law of the excluded middle.\n\nThe proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:\n\nIf (B) is neither true nor false, then it must be not true. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be true. Since initially (B) was not true and is now true, another paradox arises.\n\nAnother reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as Graham Priest has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:\n\nIf (C) is both true and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not true. Since initially (C) was true and is now not true, it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a two-valued relational semantics (as opposed to functional semantics), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.\n\nThere are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:\n\nAssume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.\n\nAssume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false – the same paradox as (A) above.\n\nThe multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:\n\nAssume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAssume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false – the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).\n\nThere are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:\n\nIf F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:\n\nAlfred Tarski diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the \"object language\", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a \"meta-language\" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in \"languages\" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the \"language\" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.\n\nHowever, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as \"For every statement in level \"α\" of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level \"α\"+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.\" This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible).\n\nArthur Prior asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to Charles Sanders Peirce and John Buridan) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".\n\nThus the following two statements are equivalent:\n\nThe latter is a simple contradiction of the form \"A and not A\", and hence is false. There is therefore no paradox because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills presents a similar answer. \n\nSaul Kripke argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts. If the only thing Smith says about Jones is\n\nand Jones says only these three things about Smith:\n\nIf Smith really is a big spender but is \"not\" soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.\n\nKripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is \"grounded\". If not, that statement is \"ungrounded\". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.\n\nJon Barwise and John Etchemendy propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a \"denial\" and a \"negation\". If the liar means, \"It is not the case that this statement is true\", then it is denying itself. If it means, \"This statement is not true\", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on situation semantics, that the \"denial liar\" can be true without contradiction while the \"negation liar\" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of non-well-founded set theory.\n\nGraham Priest and other logicians, including J. C. Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as dialetheism. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized principle of explosion, which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism – the view that \"all\" propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called \"paraconsistent\".\n\nAndrew Irvine has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for resolving the paradox.\n\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the Vākyapadīya. Although chronologically he precedes all modern treatments of the problem of the liar paradox, it has only very recently become possible for those who cannot read the original Sanskrit sources to confront his views and analyses with those of modern logicians and philosophers because sufficiently reliable editions and translations of his work have only started becoming available since the second half of the 20th century. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as \"relativistic\", \"non-committal\" or \"perspectivistic\". With regard to the liar paradox (\"sarvam mithyā bhavāmi\" \"everything I am saying is false\") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter which can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: \"Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.\" According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor \"time\" which allows us to reconcile the separated \"parts of the world\" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy. The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two \"parts of the world\" is here external to the \"liar\". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time which separates two perspectives on the world or two \"parts of the world\" – the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task – is inherent in any \"function\": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the \"liar\". The unsolvable paradox – a situation in which we have either contradiction (\"virodha\") or infinite regress (\"anavasthā\") – arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox (Bhartrhari's paradox), when abstraction is made from this function (\"vyāpāra\") and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (\"apara vyāpāra\") undoing the previous one.\n\nFor a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If \"this statement is false\" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is self-referential it is possible to give the condition by an equation.\n\nIf some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, \"B = false\". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as \"C = 'B = false. Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:\n\nThis is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the boolean domain \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; Arthur Prior claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.\n\nGödel's incompleteness theorems are two fundamental theorems of mathematical logic which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by Kurt Gödel in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing \"this sentence is false\" with \"this sentence is not provable\", called the \"Gödel sentence G\". His proof showed that for any sufficiently powerful theory T, G is true, but not provable in T. The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.\n\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel represented statements by numbers. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the Gödel sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.\n\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a Gödel sentence because the predicate \"Q is the Gödel number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski's undefinability theorem, was discovered independently by Gödel (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by Alfred Tarski.\n\nGeorge Boolos has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry's paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.\n\nThe liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In \"\" episode \"I, Mudd\", the liar paradox is used by Captain Kirk and Harry Mudd to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Green Death\", the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it \"If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?\" However BOSS eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.\n\nIn the 2011 videogame \"Portal 2\", GLaDOS attempts to use the \"this sentence is false\" paradox to defeat the naïve artificial intelligence Wheatley, but, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement a paradox, he simply responds, \"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy.\" and is unaffected.\n\nIn the seventh episode of \"\" titled \"Access Denied\" the main character Jesse and his friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with his last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make him say is the liar paradox.\n\nIn Douglas Adams The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, chapter 21 he describes a solitary old man inhabiting a small asteroid in the spatial coordinates where it should have been a whole planet dedicated to Biro (ballpoint pen) life forms. This old man repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.\n\nRollins Band's 1994 song \"Liar\" alluded to the paradox when the narrator ends the song by stating \"I'll lie again and again and I'll keep lying, I promise\".\n\nRobert Earl Keen's song \"The Road Goes On and On\" alludes to the paradox. The song is widely believed to be written as part of Keen's feud with Toby Keith, who is presumably the \"liar\" Keen refers to.\n\nBULLET::::- Buridan's bridge\nBULLET::::- Performative contradiction\nBULLET::::- Card paradox\nBULLET::::- Epimenides paradox\nBULLET::::- Hilbert–Bernays paradox\nBULLET::::- Insolubilia\nBULLET::::- Knights and Knaves\nBULLET::::- List of paradoxes\nBULLET::::- Pinocchio paradox\nBULLET::::- Quine's paradox\nBULLET::::- Socratic paradox\nBULLET::::- Yablo's paradox\n\nBULLET::::- Greenough, P.M., (2001) \" Free Assumptions and the Liar Paradox,\" \"American Philosophical Quarterly 38/2, pp. 115-135.\":\nBULLET::::- Hughes, G.E., (1992) \"John Buridan on Self-Reference : Chapter Eight of Buridan's Sophismata, with a Translation, and Introduction, and a Philosophical Commentary\", Cambridge Univ.

It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s.\n\nThe \"louchébem\" word-creation process resembles that of \"largonji\", \"verlan\", and \"javanais\", in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules. Strictly speaking, \"louchébem\" is a more rigid variety of \"largonji\" in which the ending \"-èm\" is obligatory. \"Largonji\" substitutes for the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a suffix particular to the argot: \"-ji\" , \"-oc\" , \"-ic\" , \"-uche\" , \"-ès\" , or in the case of louchébem, \"-em/ème\" .\n\nNote that \"louchébem\" is first and foremost an oral language, and spelling is usually phoneticized.\n\nDespite the name, \"louchébem\" seems to have been created not by butchers but by inmates at Brest Prison, with records dating back to 1821.\n\nEdmund Clerihew Bentley used the language as a plot point in his 1937 short story \"The Old-Fashioned Apache\".\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation \"louchébem\" was used by Parisian members of the Resistance.\n\nEven today, \"louchébem\" is still well-known and used among those working at point-of-sale in the meat retail industry.

{"id": "17970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17970", "title": "Leon M. Lederman", "text": "Leon M. Lederman\n\nLeon Max Lederman (July 15, 1922 – October 3, 2018) was an American experimental physicist who received the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1982, along with Martin Lewis Perl, for their research on quarks and leptons, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, for their research on neutrinos. Lederman was Director Emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. He founded the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, in Aurora, Illinois in 1986, and was Resident Scholar Emeritus there from 2012 until his death in 2018.\n\nAn accomplished scientific writer, he became known for his 1993 book \"The God Particle\" establishing the importance of the Higgs boson.\n\nLederman was born in New York City, New York, to Morris and Minna (Rosenberg) Lederman. His parents were Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants from Kiev and Odessa. Lederman graduated from James Monroe High School in the South Bronx, and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1943.\n\nHe next enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, intending to become a physicist after his service. Following his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at Columbia University's graduate school, receiving his Ph.D. in 1951.\n\nLederman became a faculty member at Columbia University, and he was promoted to full professor in 1958 as Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics. In 1960, on leave from Columbia, he spent time at CERN in Geneva as a Ford Foundation Fellow. He took an extended leave of absence from Columbia in 1979 to become director of Fermilab. Resigning from Columbia (and retiring from Fermilab) in 1989, he then taught briefly at the University of Chicago. He then moved to the physics department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he served as the Pritzker Professor of Science. In 1992, Lederman served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nLederman served as President of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and at the time of his death was Chair Emeritus. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1989 to 1992, and was a member of the JASON defense advisory group. Lederman was also one of the main proponents of the \"Physics First\" movement. Also known as \"Right-side Up Science\" and \"Biology Last,\" this movement seeks to rearrange the current high school science curriculum so that physics precedes chemistry and biology.\n\nLederman was an early supporter of Science Debate 2008, an initiative to get the then-candidates for president, Barack Obama and John McCain, to debate the nation's top science policy challenges. In October 2010, Lederman participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engaged in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Lederman was also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.\n\nIn 1956, Lederman worked on parity violation in weak interactions. R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment, and they immediately verified the parity violation. They delayed publication of their results until after Wu's group was ready, and the two papers appeared back to back in the same physics journal. Among his achievements are the discovery of the muon neutrino in 1962 and the bottom quark in 1977. These helped establish his reputation as among the top particle physicists.\n\nIn 1977, a group of physicists, the E288 experiment team, led by Lederman announced that a particle with a mass of about 6.0 GeV was being produced by the Fermilab particle accelerator. After taking further data, the group discovered that this particle did not actually exist, and the \"discovery\" was named \"Oops-Leon\" as a pun on the original name and Lederman's first name.\n\nAs the director of Fermilab, Lederman was a prominent supporter of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. Lederman later wrote his 1993 popular science book \"\" – which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project – in the context of the project's last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s. The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditures. In \"The God Particle\" he wrote, \"The history of atomism is one of reductionism – the effort to reduce all the operations of nature to a small number of laws governing a small number of primordial objects\" while stressing the importance of the Higgs boson.\n\nIn 1988, Lederman received the Nobel Prize for Physics along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger \"for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino\". Lederman also received the National Medal of Science (1965), the Elliott Cresson Medal for Physics (1976), the Wolf Prize for Physics (1982) and the Enrico Fermi Award (1992). In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum \"Making History Award\" for Distinction in Science Medicine and Technology.\n\nLederman's best friend during his college years, Martin J. Klein, convinced him of \"the splendors of physics during a long evening over many beers\". He was known for his sense of humor in the physics community. On August 26, 2008 Lederman was video-recorded by a science focused organization called ScienCentral, on the street in a major U.S. city, answering questions from passersby. He answered questions such as \"What is the strong force?\" and \"What happened before the Big Bang?\".\n\nDespite his Jewish background, Lederman was an atheist. He had three children with his first wife, Florence Gordon, and toward the end of his life lived with his second wife, Ellen (Carr), in Driggs, Idaho.\n\nLederman began to suffer from memory loss in 2011 and, after struggling with medical bills, he had to sell his Nobel medal for $765,000 to cover the costs in 2015. He died of complications from dementia on October 3, 2018, at a care facility in Rexburg, Idaho at the age of 96.\n\nBULLET::::- Election to the National Academy of Sciences, 1965.\nBULLET::::- National Medal of Science, 1965.\nBULLET::::- Election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1970.\nBULLET::::- Elliott Cresson Prize of the Franklin Institute, 1976.\nBULLET::::- Wolf Prize in Physics, 1982.\nBULLET::::- Nobel Prize in Physics, 1988.\nBULLET::::- Election to the American Philosophical Society, 1989.\nBULLET::::- Enrico Fermi Prize of the United States Department of Energy, 1992.\nBULLET::::- Appointment as a Tetelman Fellow at Jonathan Edwards College, 1994.\nBULLET::::- Doctor of Humane Letters, DePaul University, 1995.\nBULLET::::- Ordem Nacional do Merito Cientifico (Brazil), 1995.\nBULLET::::- \"In Praise of Reason\" from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP), 1996.\nBULLET::::- Medallion, Division of Particles and Fields, Mexican Physical Society, 1999.\nBULLET::::- Vannevar Bush Prize, 2012.\n\nBULLET::::- \"The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?\" by Leon M.

{"id": "17972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17972", "title": "Louis the Pious", "text": "Louis the Pious\n\nLouis the Pious (778 – 20 June 840), also called the Fair, and the Debonaire, was the King of the Franks and co-emperor with his father, Charlemagne, from 813. He was also King of Aquitaine from 781.\nAs the only surviving adult son of Charlemagne and Hildegard, he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father's death in 814, a position which he held until his death, save for the period 833–34, during which he was deposed.\n\nDuring his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire's southwestern frontier. He conquered Barcelona from the Muslims in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over Pamplona and the Basques south of the Pyrenees in 812. As emperor he included his adult sons, Lothair, Pepin, and Louis, in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew Bernard of Italy, for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.\n\nIn the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons, only exacerbated by Louis's attempts to include his son Charles by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father, though the problems he faced were of a distinctly different sort.\n\nLouis was born while his father Charlemagne was on campaign in Spain, at the Carolingian villa of Cassinogilum, according to Einhard and the anonymous chronicler called Astronomus; the place is usually identified with Chasseneuil, near Poitiers. He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife Hildegard. \n\nLouis was crowned King of Aquitaine as a child in 781 and sent there with regents and a court. Charlemagne constituted the sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his kingdom after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under Waifer (capitulated \"c\". 768) and later Hunald II, which culminated in the disastrous Battle of Roncesvalles (778). Charlemagne wanted his son Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, in 785, wary of the customs his son may have been taking in Aquitaine, Charlemagne sent for him to Aquitaine and Louis presented himself at the Royal Council of Paderborn dressed up in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of Vasconia were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.\n\nIn 794, Charlemagne settled four former Gallo-Roman villas on Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: Doué-la-Fontaine in today's Anjou, Ebreuil in Allier, Angeac-Charente, and the disputed Cassinogilum. Charlemagne's intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at so young an age. Each kingdom had its importance in keeping some frontier, Louis's was the Spanish March. In 797, Barcelona, the greatest city of the \"Marca\", fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Córdoba and, failing, handed it to them. The Umayyad authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including Gascons with their duke Sancho I of Gascony, Provençals under Leibulf, and Goths under Bera, over the Pyrenees and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The sons were not given independence from central authority, however, and Charlemagne ingrained in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on military expeditions far from their home bases. Louis campaigned in the Italian Mezzogiorno against the Beneventans at least once.\nLouis was one of Charlemagne's three legitimate sons to survive infancy. He had a twin brother, Lothair who died during infancy. According to Frankish custom, Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, Charles the Younger, King of Neustria, and Pepin, King of Italy. In the \"Divisio Regnorum\" of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as emperor and chief king, ruling over the Frankish heartland of Neustria and Austrasia, while giving Pepin the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis's kingdom of Aquitaine, he added Septimania, Provence, and part of Burgundy. However, Charlemagne's other legitimate sons died – Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811 – and Louis alone remained to be crowned co-emperor with Charlemagne in 813. On his father's death in 814, he inherited the entire Frankish kingdom and all its possessions (with the sole exception of Italy, which remained within Louis's empire, but under the direct rule of Bernard, Pepin's son).\n\nWhile at his villa of Doué-la-Fontaine, Anjou, Louis received news of his father's death. He rushed to Aachen and crowned himself emperor to shouts of \"Vivat Imperator Ludovicus\" by the attending nobles.\n\nUpon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen, one of Louis' first acts was to purge the palace of its \"filth\". He destroyed the old Germanic pagan tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally \"dissolute\", including some of his own relatives.\n\nFrom the start of his reign, his coinage imitated his father Charlemagne's portrait, which gave it an image of imperial authority and prestige. He quickly sent all of his unmarried sisters to nunneries, to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law. Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers, he forced his father's cousins, Adalard and Wala to be tonsured, placing them in Noirmoutier and Corbie, respectively, despite the latter's initial loyalty.\n\nHis chief counsellors were Bernard, margrave of Septimania, and Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims. The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later. He retained some of his father's ministers, such as Elisachar, abbot of St. Maximin near Trier, and Hildebold, Archbishop of Cologne. Later he replaced Elisachar with Hildwin, abbot of many monasteries.\n\nHe also employed Benedict of Aniane (the Second Benedict), a Septimanian Visigoth and monastic founder, to help him reform the Frankish church. One of Benedict's primary reforms was to ensure that all religious houses in Louis' realm adhered to the Rule of Saint Benedict, named for its creator, Benedict of Nursia (480–550), the First Benedict.\n\nIn 816, Pope Stephen IV, who had succeeded Leo III, visited Reims and again crowned Louis (Sunday 5 October). \n\nOn Maundy Thursday 817 (9 April), Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen when the gallery collapsed, killing many. Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession; three months later he issued an \"Ordinatio Imperii\", an imperial decree that laid out plans for an orderly succession. In 815, he had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons Lothair and Pepin to govern Bavaria and Aquitaine respectively, though without the royal titles. Now, he proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:\n\nBULLET::::- Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.\nBULLET::::- Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.\nBULLET::::- Louis, the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.\n\nIf one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious' younger sons would be chosen to replace him by \"the people\". Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.\n\nWith this settlement, Louis tried to combine his sense for the Empire's unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.\n\nThe \"ordinatio imperii\" of Aachen left Bernard Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence upon hearing of it. Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and betook himself to Chalon-sur-Saône. Intimidated by the emperor's swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: Theodulf of Orléans, in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned. The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis's conscience for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed penance for causing Bernard's death, at his palace of Attigny near Vouziers in the Ardennes, before Pope Paschal I, and a council of ecclesiastics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, Hugo whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, Drogo whom he soon made Bishop of Metz, and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of Theodosius I, had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.\n\nAt the start of Louis's reign, the many tribes – Danes, Obotrites, Slovenes, Bretons, Basques – which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor's power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the Sorbs rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace of the Franks in a short time.\n\nA greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, Ljudevit, duke of Pannonia, was harassing the border at the Drava and Sava rivers. The margrave of Friuli, Cadolah, was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with Borna, duke of the Dalmatia, and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of Bulgaria acknowledged Louis's suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler Omurtag, in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in Pannonia and regained their lands.\n\nOn the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard princes of Benevento whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes Grimoald IV and Sico, but to no effect.\n\nOn the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees 'to settle matters' in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the Basques in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. Séguin, duke of Gascony, was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by Lupus III, who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at Quierzy-sur-Oise decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, Hugh, count of Tours, and Matfrid, count of Orléans, were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.\n\nIn 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to Brittany, he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, Ermengarde. Ermengarde was the daughter of Ingerman, the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew's death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to Judith, daughter of Welf, count of Altdorf. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named Charles.\n\nThe birth of this son damaged the \"Partition of Aachen\", as Louis's attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war.\n\nAt Worms in 829, Louis gave Alemannia to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair, whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.\n\nWith the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. Agobard, Archbishop of Lyon, and Jesse, bishop of Amiens, too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.\n\nIn 830, at Wala's insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of Gascons, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At Verberie, Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as Compiègne, an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin's forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at Poitiers and Bernard fled to Barcelona.\n\nThen Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in Nijmegen, in the heart of Austrasia, the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.\n\nPepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith – after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence – to Louis's court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of Lake Geneva. Although Hilduin, abbot of Saint Denis, was exiled to Paderborn and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps; they did not lose their freedom.\n\nThe next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father's court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father's orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of Slav allies and conquered Swabia before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At Jonac, he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father's authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.\n\nSoon Lothair, with the support of Pope Gregory IV, whom he had confirmed in office without his father's support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis's army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because \"it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.\" The resigned emperor was taken to Saint-Médard de Soissons, his son Charles to Prüm, and the queen to Tortona. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name Field of Lies, or Lügenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, \"ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est\".\n\nOn 13 November 833, Ebbo, with Agobard of Lyon, presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public penance for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, Judith of Bavaria. Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops. Louis was to live the rest of his life as a penitent, never to hold office again. The penance divided the aristocracy. The anonymous biographer of the Vita Hludovici criticized the whole affair on the basis that God does not judge twice for sins committed and confessed. Lothair's allies were generously compensated. Ebbo himself received the monastery of St Vaast whilst Pepin was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father. \n\nMen like Rabanus Maurus, Louis' younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith's sister and Louis the German's new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compiègne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and Saxony against Lothair, and the usurper fled to Burgundy, skirmishing with loyalists near Chalon-sur-Saône. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.\n\nOn Lothair's return to Italy, Wala, Jesse, and Matfrid, formerly count of Orléans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace Thionville, Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the Synod of Thionville, Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of Carolingian rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop Ebbo officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst Agobard of Lyon and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed. Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.\n\nIn 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of Crémieu. At about that time, the Vikings terrorized and sacked Utrecht and Antwerp. In 837, they went up the Rhine as far as Nijmegen, and their king, Rorik, demanded the wergild of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over Frisia, but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of \"missi dominici\" into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.\n\nIn 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis' land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at Quierzy-sur-Oise, giving all of the young king of Bavaria's lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin's son Pepin II. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the Loire, and the Danes returned to ravage the Frisian coast (sacking Dorestad for a second time).\n\nLothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final \"placitum\" held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at Clermont-en-Auvergne in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the Ostmark. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to Frankfurt am Main, where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.\n\nLouis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and went to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine, by his palace at Ingelheim. He died 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo, though Charles and Judith were absent in Poitiers. Soon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into a civil war that was only settled in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun, which split the Frankish realm into three parts, to become the kernels of France and Germany, with Burgundy and the Low Countries between them. The dispute over the kingship of Aquitaine was not fully settled until 860.\n\nLouis was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Arnould in Metz.\n\nBy his first wife, Ermengarde of Hesbaye (married c. 794), he had three sons and three daughters:\nBULLET::::- Lothair (795–855), king of Middle Francia\nBULLET::::- Pepin (797–838), king of Aquitaine\nBULLET::::- Adelaide (b. c. 799)\nBULLET::::- Rotrude (b. 800)\nBULLET::::- Hildegard (or Matilda) (b. c. 802)\nBULLET::::- Louis the German (c. 806–876), king of East Francia\n\nBy his second wife, Judith of Bavaria, he had a daughter and a son:\nBULLET::::- Gisela, married Eberhard of Friuli\nBULLET::::- Charles the Bald, king of West Francia\n\nBy Theodelinde of Sens, he had two illegitimate children:\nBULLET::::- Arnulf of Sens\nBULLET::::- Alpais\n\nBULLET::::- \"Vita Hludovici Imperatoris \", the main source for his reign, written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called \"the Astronomer\"\nBULLET::::- \"Gesta Hludowici Imperatoris\" by Thegan of Trier on-line Latin text\n\nBULLET::::- Booker, Courtney M. \"Past Convictions: The Penance of Louis the Pious and the Decline of the Carolingians\", University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009,\nBULLET::::- De Jong, Mayke. \"The Penitential State: Authority and Atonement in the Age of Louis the Pious, 814–840\".

{"id": "17973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17973", "title": "Liquid crystal", "text": "Liquid crystal\n\nLiquid crystals (LCs) are a state of matter which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as textures). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Most contemporary electronic displays use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of soap and various related detergents, as well as the tobacco mosaic virus, and some clays.\n\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist Friedrich Reinitzer, working at the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität, examined the physico-chemical properties of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point, but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature. He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt in the same manner as other compounds, but has two melting points. At it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to Otto Lehmann, at that time a \"\" in Aachen. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing crystallites. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized light, and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel Vorländer, who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book \"Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals\" became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125 °C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116 °C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105 °C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\nIn 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, MBBA, which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.\n\nThese molecules are rod-shaped, some created in the laboratory and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been synthesized: disc-shaped (by Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar in India in 1977) and cone or bowl shaped (predicted by Lui Lam in China in 1982 and synthesized in Europe in 1985).\n\nIn 1991, when liquid crystal displays were already well established, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes working at the Université Paris-Sud received the Nobel Prize in physics \"for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers\".\n\nA large number of chemical compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotic and conic LCs. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.\n\nBULLET::::- The molecular shape should be relatively thin, flat or conic, especially within rigid molecular frameworks.\nBULLET::::- The molecular length should be at least 1.3 nm, consistent with the presence of long alkyl group on many room-temperature liquid crystals.\nBULLET::::- The structure should not be branched or angular, except for the conic LC.\nBULLET::::- A low melting point is preferable in order to avoid metastable, monotropic liquid crystalline phases. Low-temperature mesomorphic behavior in general is technologically more useful, and alkyl terminal groups promote this.\n\nAn extended, structurally rigid, highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.\n\nThe various liquid-crystal phases (called mesophases) can be characterized by the type of ordering. One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes macroscopic, dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an isotropic phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and fluid-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant anisotropic orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.\n\nThe ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The orientational ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.\n\nThermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating a particular type of LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.\n\nOne of the most common LC phases is the nematic. The word \"nematic\" comes from the Greek (\"\"), which means \"thread\". This term originates from the thread-like topological defects observed in nematics, which are formally called 'disclinations'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the \"calamitic\" or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel. Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order. Most nematics are uniaxial: they have one axis that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are biaxial nematics, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).\n\nScientists have discovered that electrons can unite to flow together in high magnetic fields, to create an \"electronic nematic\" form of matter.\n\nThe smectic phases, which are found at lower temperatures than the nematic, form well-defined layers that can slide over one another in a manner similar to that of soap. The word \"smectic\" originates from the Latin word \"smecticus\", meaning cleaning, or having soap-like properties.\nThe smectics are thus positionally ordered along one direction. In the Smectic A phase, the molecules are oriented along the layer normal, while in the Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it. These phases are liquid-like within the layers. There are many different smectic phases, all characterized by different types and degrees of positional and orientational order. Beyond organic molecules, Smectic ordering has also been reported to occur within colloidal suspensions of 2-D materials or nanosheets.\n\nThe chiral nematic phase exhibits chirality (handedness). This phase is often called the \"cholesteric\" phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.\nThe \"chiral pitch\", p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.\nBlue phases are liquid crystal phases that appear in the temperature range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.\n\nAlthough blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvins. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60 K including room temperature (260–326 K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times of the order of 10 s.\n\nIn May 2008, the first Blue Phase Mode LCD panel had been developed.\n\nDisk-shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.\n\nConic LC molecules, like in discotics, can form columnar phases. Other phases, such as nonpolar nematic, polar nematic, stringbean, donut and onion phases, have been predicted. Conic phases, except nonpolar nematic, are polar phases.\n\nA lyotropic liquid crystal consists of two or more components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.\n\nA compound that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts within the same molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\nBULLET::::- Discontinuous cubic phase (micellar cubic phase)\nBULLET::::- Hexagonal phase (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\nBULLET::::- Lamellar phase\nBULLET::::- Bicontinuous cubic phase\nBULLET::::- Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\nBULLET::::- Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock copolymers.\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting \"inorganic\" phases like ZnCl that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.\n\nThermotropic mesophases are detected and characterized by two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, in which a small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.\n\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as lipid polymorphism. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, biological membranes and cell membranes are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. phospholipids) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on lipid polymorphism). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by flippases and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated protein solution that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength. DNA and many polypeptides, including actively-driven cytoskeletal filaments, can also form liquid crystal phases. Monolayers of elongated cells have also been described to exhibit liquid-crystal behavior, and the associated topological defects have been associated with biological consequences, including cell death and extrusion. Together, these biological appliations of liquid crystals form an important part of current academic research.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can also be found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase in the case of the smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.\nA lamellar phase was even discovered, HSbPO, which exhibits hyperswelling up to ~250 nm for the interlamellar distance.\n\nAnisotropy of liquid crystals is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially than those of ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and is so strong that usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.\n\nMicroscopic theoretical treatment of fluid phases can become quite complicated, owing to the high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the \"director\", is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second Legendre polynomial:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the \"local director\" (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its \"local optical axis\"). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, \"S\" = 0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, \"S\" is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase. The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, diamagnetism, birefringence, Raman scattering, NMR and EPR can be used to determine S.\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the \"z\"-axis the density formula_3 is often given by:\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as formula_5 and formula_6 the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic formula_7 and for a smectic phase formula_8 will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.\n\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a \"decrease\" in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).\n\nThe fundamental insight here is that, whilst parallel arrangements of anisotropic objects lead to a decrease in orientational entropy, there is an increase in positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.\n\nThis statistical theory, proposed by Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a mean-field average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.\n\nMcMillan's model, proposed by William McMillan, is an extension of the Maier–Saupe mean field theory used to describe the phase transition of a liquid crystal from a nematic to a smectic A phase. It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second Legendre polynomial and the second order parameter is given by:\n\nThe values \"z, θ\", and \"d\" are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\nHere constant α quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.\n\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers.\n\nScientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\nWhere formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n\nIn nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend on the linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of formula_16. The most general form to express formula_13 is\n\nwith formula_19 and formula_20 the electric permittivity parallel and perpendicular to formula_12. Then density of energy is (ignoring the constant terms that do not contribute to the dynamics of the system)\n\nIf formula_23 is positive, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_12 and formula_16 are parallel. This means that the system will favor aligning the liquid crystal with the externally applied electric field. If formula_23 is negative, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_12 and formula_16 are perpendicular (in nematics the perpendicular orientation is degenerated, making possible the emergence of vortices).\n\nThe parameter formula_29 is called dielectrical anisotropy and is an important parameter in liquid crystal applications. There are both formula_30 and formula_31 commercial liquid crystals. 5CB and E7 liquid crystal mixture are two formula_30 liquid crystals commonly used. MBBA is a common formula_31 liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.\n\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called photoalignment.\n\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\nAs already described, chiral liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.\n\nChirality can also be incorporated into a phase by adding a chiral dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain a small amount of such dopants.\n\nLiquid crystals find wide use in liquid crystal displays, which rely on the optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in the presence or absence of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.\n\nLiquid crystal tunable filters are used as electrooptical devices, e.g., in hyperspectral imaging.\n\nThermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.\n\nLiquid crystal lenses converge or diverge the incident light by adjusting the refractive index of liquid crystal layer with applied voltage or temperature. Generally, the liquid crystal lenses generate a parabolic refractive index distribution by arranging molecular orientations. Therefore, a plane wave is reshaped into a parabolic wavefront by a liquid crystal lens. The focal length of liquid crystal lenses could be continuously tunable when the external electric field can be properly tuned. Liquid crystal lenses are a kind of adaptive optics. Imaging system can be benefited with focusing correction, image plane adjustment, or changing the range of depth-of-field or depth of focus. Liquid crystal lens is one of the candidates to develop vision correction device for myopia and presbyopia eyes (e.g., tunable eyeglass and smart contact lenses).\n\nLiquid crystal lasers use a liquid crystal in the lasing medium as a distributed feedback mechanism instead of external mirrors. Emission at a photonic bandgap created by the periodic dielectric structure of the liquid crystal gives a low-threshold high-output device with stable monochromatic emission.\n\nPolymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) sheets and rolls are available as adhesive backed Smart film which can be applied to windows and electrically switched between transparent and opaque to provide privacy.\n\nMany common fluids, such as soapy water, are in fact liquid crystals. Soap forms a variety of LC phases depending on its concentration in water.\n\nBULLET::::- Definitions of basic terms relating to low-molar-mass and polymer liquid crystals (IUPAC Recommendations 2001)\nBULLET::::- An intelligible introduction to liquid crystals from Case Western Reserve University\nBULLET::::- Liquid Crystal Physics tutorial from the Liquid Crystals Group, University of Colorado\nBULLET::::- Liquid Crystals & Photonics Group – Ghent University (Belgium), good tutorial\nBULLET::::- Simulation of light propagation in liquid crystals, free program\nBULLET::::- Liquid Crystals Interactive Online\nBULLET::::- Liquid Crystal Institute Kent State University\nBULLET::::- Liquid Crystals a journal by Taylor&Francis\nBULLET::::- Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals a journal by Taylor & Francis\nBULLET::::- Hot-spot detection techniques for ICs\nBULLET::::- What are liquid crystals? from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden\nBULLET::::- Progress in liquid crystal chemistry Thematic series in the Open Access Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry\nBULLET::::- DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package- \"Liquid Crystals\"\nBULLET::::- Bowlic liquid crystal from San Jose State University\n"}

In small arms, a \"long gun\" is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand. In the context of cannons and mounted firearms an artillery \"long gun\" would be contrasted with a howitzer or carronade.\n\nThe actual length of the barrels of a long gun are subject to various laws in many jurisdictions, for example by the National Firearms Act in the United States, which sets a minimum length of 16 inches (40 cm) for rifle barrels and 18 inches (45 cm) for shotgun barrels. Canada has a limit of 18.5 inches (47 cm) for either. In addition, Canada puts a minimum fireable length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks of 26 inches (66 cm). In the United States, the minimum length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks is with the stock in the extended position.\n\nExamples of various classes of small arms generally considered long arms include, but are not limited to: rifles, carbines, shotguns, muskets, blunderbusses, submachine guns, personal defense weapons, wall guns, and musketoons.\n\nAlmost all long-arms have front grips (forearms) and shoulder stocks, which provides the user the ability to hold the firearm more steadily than a handgun. In addition, the long barrel of a long gun usually provides a longer distance between the front and rear sights, providing the user with more precision when aiming. The presence of a stock makes the use of a telescopic sight or red dot sight easier than with a hand gun.\n\nThe mass of a long gun is usually greater than that of a short gun, making the long gun more expensive to transport, and more difficult and tiring to carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower and more difficult to traverse and elevate, and it is thus slower and more difficult to adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends to make it more expensive to manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it more difficult to conceal, and more inconvenient to use in confined quarters, as well as requiring a larger storage space.\n\nAs long guns include a stock which is braced against the shoulder, the recoil when firing is transferred directly into the body of the user. This allows better control of aim than handguns, which do not include a stock and thus all their recoil must be transferred to the arms of the user. It also makes it possible to manage larger amounts of recoil without damage or loss of control; in combination with the higher mass of long guns this means more propellant (such as gunpowder) can be used and thus larger projectiles can be fired at higher velocities. This is one of the main reasons for the use of long guns over handguns - faster or heavier projectiles help with penetration and accuracy over longer distances. \n\nShotguns are long guns that are designed to fire many small projectiles at once. This makes them very effective at close ranges, but with diminished usefulness at long range.\n\nIn historical navy usage, a long gun was the standard type of cannon mounted by a sailing vessel, called such to distinguish it from the much shorter carronades. In informal usage, the length was combined with the weight of shot, yielding terms like \"long 9s\", referring to full length cannons firing a 9-pound round shot.\n\nBULLET::::- Large-calibre artillery\nBULLET::::- Rail-gun (disambiguation), any of several guns utilizing one or more rails for mobilizing, stability/shot consistency, or accelerating a projectile\n"}
{"id": "17981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17981", "title": "Law of definite proportions", "text": "Law of definite proportions\n\nIn chemistry, the law of definite proportion, sometimes called Proust's law or the law of definite composition, or law of constant composition states that a given \nchemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio (by mass) and does not depend on its source and method of preparation. For example, oxygen makes up about / of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining / of the mass. Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry.\n\nThe law of constant proportion was given by Joseph Proust in 1779. This observation was first made by the English theologian and chemist Joseph Priestley, and Antoine Lavoisier, a French nobleman and chemist centered on the process of combustion. \nThe law of definite proportions might seem obvious to the modern chemist, inherent in the very definition of a chemical compound. At the end of the 18th century, however, when the concept of a chemical compound had not yet been fully developed, the law was novel. In fact, when first proposed, it was a controversial statement and was opposed by other chemists, most notably Proust's fellow Frenchman Claude Louis Berthollet, who argued that the elements could combine in any proportion. The existence of this debate demonstrates that, at the time, the distinction between pure chemical compounds and mixtures had not yet been fully developed.\n\nThe law of definite proportions contributed to, and was placed on a firm theoretical basis by, the atomic theory that John Dalton promoted beginning in 1803, which explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms, that there was one type of atom for each element, and that the compounds were made of combinations of different types of atoms in fixed proportions.\n\nA related early idea was Prout's hypothesis, formulated by English chemist William Prout, who proposed that the hydrogen atom was the fundamental atomic unit. From this hypothesis was derived the whole number rule, which was the rule of thumb that atomic masses were whole number multiples of the mass of hydrogen. This was later rejected in the 1820s and 30s following more refined measurements of atomic mass, notably by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, which revealed in particular that the atomic mass of chlorine was 35.45, which was incompatible with the hypothesis. Since the 1920s this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of isotopes; the atomic mass of any isotope is very close to satisfying the whole number rule, with the mass defect caused by differing binding energies being significantly smaller.\n\nAlthough very useful in the foundation of modern chemistry, the law of definite proportions is not universally true. There exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample. Such compounds follow the law of multiple proportion. An example is the iron oxide wüstite, which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom, and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass. The ideal formula is FeO, but due to crystallographic vacancies it is about FeO. In general, Proust's measurements were not precise enough to detect such variations.\n\nIn addition, the isotopic composition of an element can vary depending on its source, hence its contribution to the mass of even a pure stoichiometric compound may vary. This variation is used in geochemical dating since astronomical, atmospheric, oceanic, crustal and deep Earth processes may concentrate lighter or heavier isotopes preferentially. With the exception of hydrogen and its isotopes, the effect is usually small, but is measurable with modern instrumentation.\n\nAn additional note: many natural polymers vary in composition (for instance DNA, proteins, carbohydrates) even when \"pure\". Polymers are generally not considered \"pure chemical compounds\" except when their molecular weight is uniform (monodisperse) and their stoichiometry is constant. In this unusual case, they still may violate the law due to isotopic variations.\n"}
{"id": "17982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17982", "title": "Limbo", "text": "Limbo\n\nIn Catholic theology, Limbo (Latin \"limbus\", edge or boundary, referring to the edge of Hell) is a postulated viewpoint concerning the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned. Medieval theologians of western Europe described the underworld (\"hell\", \"hades\", \"infernum\") as divided into four distinct parts: Hell of the Damned, Purgatory, Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs, and Limbo of the Infants. However, Limbo of the Infants is not an official doctrine of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe \"Limbo of the Patriarchs\" or \"Limbo of the Fathers\" (Latin \"limbus patrum\") is seen as the temporary state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter Heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible. The term \"Limbo of the Fathers\" was a medieval name for the part of the underworld (Hades) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ's soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them (see Harrowing of Hell). The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ's descent into Hell as meaning primarily that \"the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into Hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead.\" It adds: \"But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.\" It does not use the word \"Limbo\".\n\nThis concept of Limbo affirms that admittance to Heaven is possible only through the intervention of Jesus Christ, but does not portray Moses, etc. as being punished eternally in Hell. The concept of Limbo of the Patriarchs is not spelled out in Scripture, but is seen by some as implicit in various references.\n\nJesus told the Good Thief that the two of them would be together \"this day\" in \"Paradise\" (; see also ); but on the Sunday of his resurrection he said that he had \"not yet ascended to the Father\" (). Some say that the descent of Jesus to the abode of the dead, his presence among them, turned it into a paradise. Others understand the text to mean not \"I say to you, This day you will be with me in paradise\", but \"I say to you this day, You will be with me in paradise\". Timothy Radcliffe explained the \"today\" as a reference to the \"Today of eternity\".\n\nJesus is also described as preaching to \"the spirits in prison\" (1 Pet 3:19). Medieval drama sometimes portrayed Christ leading a dramatic assault—The Harrowing of Hell—during the three days between the Crucifixion and the resurrection. In this assault, Jesus freed the souls of the just and escorted them triumphantly into heaven. This imagery is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church's Holy Saturday liturgy (between Good Friday and Pascha) and in Eastern Orthodox icons of the Resurrection of Jesus.\n\nThe doctrine expressed by the term \"Limbo of the Fathers\" was taught, for instance, by Clement of Alexandria, who maintained: \"It is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the coming (of Christ) should have the advantage of the divine righteousness.\"\n\nThe Limbo of Infants (Latin \"limbus infantium\" or \"limbus puerorum\") is the hypothetical permanent status of the unbaptized who die in infancy, too young to have committed actual sins, but not having been freed from original sin. Recent Catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope, although not the certainty, that these infants may attain heaven instead of the state of Limbo.\n\nWhile the Catholic Church has a defined doctrine on original sin, it has none on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, leaving theologians free to propose different theories, which magisterium is free to accept or reject. Limbo is one such theory.\n\nIn countering Pelagius, who denied original sin, Saint Augustine of Hippo was led to state that because of original sin, \"such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: 'Judgment from one offence to condemnation' (), and again a little after: 'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation' ().\"\n\nThe Council of North African bishops, which included Augustine of Hippo, held at Carthage in 418 did not explicitly endorse all aspects of Augustine's stern view about the destiny of infants who die without baptism, but said in a section of one canon (not found in all manuscripts) that there is no \"intermediate or other happy dwelling place for children who have left this life without Baptism, without which they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, that is, eternal life\". So great was Augustine's influence in the West, however, that the Latin Fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries (e.g., Jerome, Avitus of Vienne, and Gregory the Great) did adopt his position.\n\nIn the later medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine's view. In the 12th century, Peter Abelard (1079–1142) said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment, just the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision. Others held that unbaptized infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. This theory was associated with but independent of the term \"Limbo of Infants\", which was forged about the year 1300.\n\nIf Heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with God, and Hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then, in this view, the Limbo of Infants, although technically part of hell (the outermost part, \"limbo\" meaning \"outer edge\" or \"hem\") is seen as a sort of intermediate state.\n\nThe question of Limbo is not treated in the parts of the Summa Theologica written by Saint Thomas Aquinas himself, but is dealt with in an appendix to the Supplement added after his death by Fra Rainaldo da Piperino. The Limbo of Infants is there described as an eternal state of natural joy, untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptized: \"Every man who has the use of free-will is adapted to obtain eternal life, because he can prepare himself for grace whereby to merit eternal life; so that if he fail in this, his grief will be very great, since he has lost what he was able to possess. But children were never adapted to possess eternal life, since neither was this due to them by virtue of their natural principles, for it surpasses the entire faculty of nature, nor could they perform acts of their own whereby to obtain so great a good. Hence they will nowise grieve for being deprived of the divine vision; nay, rather will they rejoice for that they will have a large share of God's goodness and their own natural perfections. Nor can it be said that they were adapted to obtain eternal life, not indeed by their own action, but by the actions of others around them, since they could be baptized by others, like other children of the same condition who have been baptized and obtained eternal life: for this is of superabundant grace that one should be rewarded without any act of one's own. Wherefore the lack of such a grace will not cause sorrow in children who die without Baptism, any more than the lack of many graces accorded to others of the same condition makes a wise man to grieve.\"\n\nThe natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of God mediated through creatures. As stated in the International Theological Commission's document on the question:\n\nThe Ecumenical Council of Florence (1442) spoke of baptism as necessary even for children and required that they be baptised soon after birth. This had earlier been affirmed at the local Council of Carthage (417). The Council of Florence also stated that those who die in original sin alone go to hell, but with pains unequal to those suffered by those who had committed actual mortal sins. John Wycliffe's attack on the necessity of infant baptism was condemned by another general council, the Council of Constance. The Council of Trent in 1547 explicitly stated that baptism (or desire for baptism) was the means by which one is transferred \"from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour.\n\nThrough the 18th and 19th centuries, individual theologians (Bianchi in 1768, H. Klee in 1835, Caron in 1855, H. Schell in 1893) continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved. By 1952 a theologian such as Ludwig Ott could, in a widely used and well-regarded manual, openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for heaven. He also told about Thomas Cajetan, a major 16th-century theologian, that suggested infants dying in the womb before birth, and so before ordinary sacramental baptism could be administered, might be saved through their mother's wish for their baptism. In its 1980 instruction on children's baptism the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated that \"with regard to children who die without having received baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them\", leaving all theories as to their fate, including Limbo, as viable possibilities. And in 1984, when Joseph Ratzinger, then Cardinal Prefect of that Congregation, stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised cannot attain salvation, he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background.\n\nThe Church's teaching expressed in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church is that \"Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.\" It adds that \"God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments\". It recalls that, apart from the sacrament, \"baptism of blood\" (as in the case of the martyrs) and in the case of catechumens who die before receiving the sacrament, explicit desire for baptism, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, ensures salvation. It states that, since Christ died for all and all are called to the same divine destiny, \"every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved\", seeing that, if they had known of the necessity of baptism, they would have desired it explicitly.\n\nIt then states: \"As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved, and Jesus' tenderness toward children which caused him to say: 'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them,' allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism.\" Merely stating that one can \"hope\" in a way of salvation other than baptism, the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants, the only certain means to \"not prevent\" their \"coming to Christ\" for salvation.\n\nOn 20 April 2007, the advisory body known as the International Theological Commission released a document, originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II, entitled \"The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized.\" After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:\n\nPope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document, indicating that he considers it consistent with the Church's teaching, though it is not an official expression of that teaching. Media reports that by the document \"the Pope closed Limbo\" are thus without foundation. In fact, the document explicitly states that \"the theory of \"limbo\", understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin. This theory, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium. Still, that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis\" (second preliminary paragraph); and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of Limbo \"remains a possible theological opinion\". The document thus allows the hypothesis of a limbo of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised, a question on which there is \"no explicit answer\" from Scripture or tradition. The traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not Heaven, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church, but are only opinions that the Church does not condemn, permitting them to be held by its members, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.\n\nNeither the Eastern Orthodox Church nor Protestantism accepts the concept of a limbo of infants; but, while not using the expression \"Limbo of the Patriarchs\", the Eastern Orthodox Church lays much stress on the resurrected Christ's action of liberating Adam and Eve and other righteous figures of the Old Testament, such as Abraham and David, from Hades (see Harrowing of Hell).\n\nSome Protestants have a similar understanding of those who died as believers prior to the crucifixion of Jesus residing in a place that is not Heaven, but not Hell. The doctrine holds that Hades has two \"compartments\", one an unnamed place of torment, the other named Abraham's Bosom. speaks of a chasm fixed between the two which cannot be crossed. Those in the unnamed \"compartment\" have no hope, and will ultimately be consigned to hell. Those in Abraham's bosom are those of whom it is written of Jesus, \"When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives...\" (Eph. 4:8, quoting Psa. 68:18). These individuals, the captives, now reside with God in Heaven. Both \"Compartments\" still exist, but Abraham's Bosom is now empty, while the other chamber is not, according to this doctrine.\n\nMormons teach that \"all who have died without a knowledge of [the] gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God.\" Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and others have taught that the dead are unconscious (or even nonexistent), awaiting their destiny on Judgment Day.\n\nThe Zoroastrian concept of \"hamistagan\" is similar to limbo. Hamistagan is a neutral state in which a soul that was neither good nor evil awaits Judgment Day.\n\nIn Islam, which denies the existence of original sin in totality, the concept of Limbo exists as \"Barzakh\", the state that exists after death, prior to the day of resurrection. During this period sinners are punished and the adequately purified rest in comfort. Children however are exempt from this stage, as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims (despite religious upbringing). After death they go directly to Heaven, where they are cared for by Abraham.\n\nIn Classical Greek Mythology, the section of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much resembling Limbo, to which the vast majority of people who were held to have deserved neither the Elysian Fields (Heaven) nor Tartarus (Hell) were consigned for eternity.\n\nIn Buddhism, \"Bardo\" (Sanskrit: \"antarabhāva\") is sometimes described as similar to limbo. It is an intermediate state in which the recently deceased experiences various phenomena before being reborn in another state, including heaven or hell. According to Mahāyāna Buddhism, the arhat must ultimately embrace the path of the bodhisattva, despite having reached enlightenment. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states that an arhat obtains a \"\"samādhikāya\" (rapture-body)\" and is reborn in a lotus in a transitory state of existence, unable to awaken for a whole eon. This is likened to a person intoxicated who must spend a certain period of time before becoming sober.\n\nBULLET::::- In the \"Divine Comedy\" poem \"Inferno\", Dante depicts Limbo as the first circle of Hell. The virtuous pagans of classical history and mythology inhabit a brightly lit and beautiful—but somber—castle which is seemingly a medieval version of Elysium.

{"id": "17983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17983", "title": "Lethe", "text": "Lethe\n\nIn Greek mythology, Lethe (Greek: , \"Lḗthē\"; , ) was one of the five rivers of the underworld of Hades. Also known as the \"Ameles potamos\" (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld, where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often identified.\n\nIn Classical Greek, the word \"lethe\" (λήθη) literally means \"oblivion\", \"forgetfulness\", or \"concealment\". It is related to the Greek word for \"truth\", \"aletheia\" (ἀλήθεια), which through the privative alpha literally means \"un-forgetfulness\" or \"un-concealment\".\n\nLethe, the river of forgetfulness, is one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld; the other four are Acheron (the river of sorrow), Cocytus (the river of lamentation), Phlegethon (the river of fire) and Styx (the river that separates Earth and the Underworld). According to Statius, it bordered Elysium, the final resting place of the virtuous. Ovid wrote that the river flowed through the cave of Hypnos, god of sleep, where its murmuring would induce drowsiness.\n\nThe shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe in order to forget their earthly life. In the \"Aeneid\", Virgil (VI.703-751) writes that it is only when the dead have had their memories erased by the Lethe that they may be reincarnated.\n\nLethe was also the name of the personification of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often associated. Hesiod's \"Theogony\" identifies her as the daughter of Eris (\"strife\"), and the sister of Ponos (\"Hardship\"), Limos (\"Starvation\"), Algea (\"Pains\"), Hysminai (\"Battles\"), Makhai (\"Wars\"), Phonoi (\"Murders\"), Androktasiai (\"Manslaughters\"), Neikea (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), Amphillogiai (\"Disputes\"), Dysnomia (\"Lawlessness\"), Ate (\"Ruin\"), and Horkos (\"Oath\").\n\nSome ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river before being reincarnated, so they would not remember their past lives. The Myth of Er in Book X of Plato's \"Republic\" tells of the dead arriving at a barren waste called the \"plain of Lethe\", through which the river \"Ameles\" (\"careless\") runs. \"Of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity,\" Plato wrote, \"and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things.\" A few mystery religions taught the existence of another river, the Mnemosyne; those who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain omniscience. Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from after death, and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe.\n\nThese two rivers are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th century BC and onward, found at Thurii in Southern Italy and elsewhere throughout the Greek world. There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the oracular shrine of Trophonius in Boeotia, from which worshippers would drink before making oracular consultations with the god.\n\nMore recently, Martin Heidegger used \"lēthē\" to symbolize the \"concealment of Being\" or \"forgetting of Being\" that he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy. Examples are found in his books on Nietzsche (Vol 1, p. 194) and on Parmenides.\n\nMany ancient Greek poems mention or describe Lethe. The river is also referenced in more recent novels and poetry. Simonides of Ceos, an ancient Greek lyrical poet, references Lethe in the sixty-seventh fragment of one of his poems. Publius Ovidius Naso, known as Ovid, in his description of the Underworld in his \"Metamorphoses,\" includes a description of Lethe as a stream that puts people to sleep. Aeneas, the protagonist of Virgil's epic Latin poem, \"Aeneid\", travels to Lethe to meet the ghost of his father in Book VI of the poem.\n\n\"\"The souls that throng the flood \"\n\n\"Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:\"\n\n\"In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,\"\n\n\"Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.\"\"\n\nVirgil also writes about Lethe in his didactic hexameter poem, the \"Georgics\".\n\nIn the \"Purgatorio\", the second \"cantica\" of Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", the Lethe is located in the Earthly Paradise atop the Mountain of Purgatory. Dante, held in the arms of Matilda, is immersed in the Lethe so that he may wipe out all memory of sin (\"Purg\". XXXI). After being washed in the Lethe, penitents are washed in the Eunoe, a river of Dante's own invention. The Lethe is also mentioned in the \"Inferno\", the first part of the \"Comedy\", as flowing down to Hell from Purgatory to be frozen in the ice around Satan, \"the last lost vestiges of the sins of the saved\" (\"Inf.\" XXXIV.130).\n\nIn his first speech in \"Paradise Lost\", Satan describes how \"The associates and copartners of our loss, Lie thus astonished on \"the oblivious pool\"\", referencing Lethe.\n\nThe French poet Charles Baudelaire referred to the river in his poem \"Spleen\". The final line is \"Où coule au lieu de sang l'eau verte du Léthé\" which one translator renders as \"...in whose veins flows the green water of Lethe...\" (the reference offers a few more English translations). \nThe same poet also wrote a poem called \"Lethe\".\n\nThe English poet John Keats references the river in his famous poem “Ode to a Nightengale”. The first four lines of the poem are:\n\nMy heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\n\nMy sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\n\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains\n\nOne minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:\n\nAmongst authors in Antiquity, the tiny Lima river between Norte Region, Portugal, and Galicia, Spain, was said to have the same properties of memory loss as the legendary Lethe River, being mistaken for it. In 138 BCE, the Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus sought to dispose of the myth, as it impeded his military campaigns in the area. He was said to have crossed the Lima and then called his soldiers from the other side, one by one, by name. The soldiers, astonished that their general remembered their names, crossed the river as well without fear. This act proved that the Lima was not as dangerous as the local myths described.\n\nIn Cádiz, Spain, the river Guadalete was originally named \"Lethe\" by local Greek and Phoenician colonists who, about to go to war, solved instead their differences by diplomacy and named the river Lethe to forever forget their former differences. When the Arabs conquered the region much later, their name for the river became Guadalete (\"River Lethe\" in Arabic). \n\nIn Alaska, a river which runs through the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is called the River Lethe. It is located within the Katmai National Park and Preserve in southwest Alaska.\n\nBULLET::::- The Golden Bough (mythology)\n"}
{"id": "17988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17988", "title": "Laurence Sterne", "text": "Laurence Sterne\n\nLaurence Sterne (24 November 1713 – 18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an Anglican clergyman. He wrote the novels \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" and \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\", and also published many sermons, wrote memoirs, and was involved in local politics. Sterne died in London after years of fighting tuberculosis.\n\nSterne was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary. His father, Roger Sterne, was an ensign in a British regiment recently returned from Dunkirk, which was disbanded on the day of Sterne's birth. Within six months the family had returned to Yorkshire, and in July 1715 they moved back to Ireland, having \"decamped with Bag & Baggage for Dublin\", in Sterne's words.\n\nThe first decade of Sterne's life was spent moving from place to place as his father was reassigned throughout Ireland. During this period Sterne never lived in one place for more than a year. In addition to Clonmel and Dublin, his family also lived in, among other places, Wicklow Town, Annamoe (County Wicklow), Drogheda (County Louth), Castlepollard (County Westmeath), and Carrickfergus (County Antrim). In 1724, his father took Sterne to Roger's wealthy brother, Richard, so that Sterne could attend Hipperholme Grammar School near Halifax; Sterne never saw his father again as Roger was ordered to Jamaica where he died of a fever in 1731. Sterne was admitted to a sizarship at Jesus College, Cambridge, in July 1733 at the age of 20. His great-grandfather Richard Sterne had been the Master of the college as well as the Archbishop of York. Sterne graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in January 1737; and returned in the summer of 1740 to be awarded his Master of Arts degree.\n\nSterne was ordained as a deacon in March 1737 and as a priest in August 1738. His religion is said to have been the \"centrist Anglicanism of his time\", known as \"latitudinarianism\". Shortly thereafter Sterne was awarded the vicarship living of Sutton-on-the-Forest in Yorkshire. Sterne married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741. Both were ill with consumption. In 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring living of Stillington by Rev. Richard Levett, Prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living. Subsequently Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton. He was also a prebendary of York Minster. Sterne's life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Dr Jaques Sterne, the Archdeacon of Cleveland and Precentor of York Minster. Sterne's uncle was an ardent Whig, and urged Sterne to begin a career of political journalism which resulted in some scandal for Sterne and, eventually, a terminal falling-out between the two men.\n\nJaques Sterne was a powerful clergyman but a mean-tempered man and a rabid politician. In 1741–42 Sterne wrote political articles supporting the administration of Sir Robert Walpole for a newspaper founded by his uncle but soon withdrew from politics in disgust. His uncle became his arch-enemy, thwarting his advancement whenever possible. Despite the friction with his uncle, Laurence's Whig sympathies remained with him throughout his life. \n\nSterne lived in Sutton for twenty years, during which time he kept up an intimacy which had begun at Cambridge with John Hall-Stevenson, a witty and accomplished \"bon vivant\", owner of Skelton Hall in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1759, to support his dean in a church squabble, Sterne wrote \"A Political Romance\" (later called \"The History of a Good Warm Watch-Coat\"), a Swiftian satire of dignitaries of the spiritual courts. At the demands of embarrassed churchmen, the book was burnt. Thus, Sterne lost his chances for clerical advancement but discovered his real talents; until the completion of this first work, \"he hardly knew that he could write at all, much less with humour so as to make his reader laugh\".\n\nHaving discovered his talent, at the age of 46, he turned over his parishes to a curate, and dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. It was while living in the countryside, having failed in his attempts to supplement his income as a farmer and struggling with tuberculosis, that Sterne began work on his best known novel, \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\", the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever. He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759.\n\nAn initial, sharply satiric version was rejected by Robert Dodsley, the London printer, just when Sterne's personal life was upset. His mother and uncle both died. His wife had a nervous breakdown and threatened suicide. Sterne continued his comic novel, but every sentence, he said, was \"written under the greatest heaviness of heart\". In this mood, he softened the satire and recounted details of Tristram's opinions, eccentric family and ill-fated childhood with a sympathetic humour, sometimes hilarious, sometimes sweetly melancholic—a comedy skirting tragedy.\n\nThe publication of \"Tristram Shandy\" made Sterne famous in London and on the continent. He was delighted by the attention, famously saying \"I wrote not [to] be \"fed\" but to be \"famous.\"\" He spent part of each year in London, being fêted as new volumes appeared. Even after the publication of volumes three and four of \"Tristram Shandy\", his love of attention (especially as related to financial success) remained undiminished. In one letter, he wrote \"One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies—the best is, they abuse it and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.\" Indeed, Baron Fauconberg rewarded Sterne by appointing him as the perpetual curate of Coxwold, North Yorkshire.\n\nSterne continued to struggle with his illness, and departed England for France in 1762 in an effort to find a climate that would alleviate his suffering. Sterne was lucky to attach himself to a diplomatic party bound for Turin, as England and France were still adversaries in the Seven Years' War. Sterne was gratified by his reception in France, where reports of the genius of \"Tristram Shandy\" had made him a celebrity. Aspects of this trip to France were incorporated into Sterne's second novel, \"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\".\n\nEarly in 1767 Sterne met Eliza Draper, the wife of an official of the East India Company, then staying on her own in London. He was quickly captivated by Eliza’s charm, vivacity and intelligence, and she did little to discourage the attentions of such a celebrated man. They met frequently, exchanged miniature portraits, and Sterne’s admiration seems to have turned into an obsession which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting, and he died from consumption a year later without seeing her again. At the beginning of 1768, Sterne brought out his \"Sentimental Journey\" which contains some extravagant references to her, and the relationship, though platonic, aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his \"Journal to Eliza\" part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. After Sterne’s death Eliza allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title \"Letters from Yorick to Eliza\" and succeeded in suppressing her letters to him, though some blatant forgeries were produced, probably by William Combe, in a volume entitled \"Eliza's Letters to Yorick\".\n\nLess than a month after \"Sentimental Journey\" was published, early in 1768, Sterne's strength failed him, and he died in his lodgings at 41 Old Bond Street on 18 March, at the age of 54. He was buried in the churchyard of St George's, Hanover Square.\n\nIt was widely rumoured that Sterne's body was stolen shortly after it was interred and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. Circumstantially, it was said that his body was recognised by Charles Collignon, who knew him and discreetly reinterred back in St George's, in an unknown plot. A year later a group of Freemasons erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the churchyard of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination. One was identified to be of a size that matched a bust of Sterne made by Nollekens.\n\nThe skull was held up to be his, albeit with \"a certain area of doubt\". Along with nearby skeletal bones, these remains were transferred to Coxwold churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust.\n\nThe story of the reinterment of Sterne's skull in Coxwold is alluded to in Malcolm Bradbury's novel \"To the Hermitage\".\n\nSterne's early works were letters; he had two ordinary sermons published (in 1747 and 1750), and tried his hand at satire. He was involved in, and wrote about, local politics in 1742. His major publication prior to \"Tristram Shandy\" was the satire \"A Political Romance\" (1759), aimed at conflicts of interest within York Minster. A posthumously published piece on the art of preaching, \"A Fragment in the Manner of Rabelais\", appears to have been written in 1759. Rabelais was by far Sterne's favourite author, and in his correspondence he made clear that he considered himself as Rabelais' successor in humour writing, distancing himself from Jonathan Swift:\n\nI ... deny I have gone as far as Swift: he keeps a due distance from Rabelais; I keep a due distance from him.\n\nSterne's novel \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" sold widely in England and throughout Europe. Translations of the work began to appear in all the major European languages almost upon its publication, and Sterne influenced European writers as diverse as Denis Diderot and the German Romanticists. His work had also noticeable influence over Brazilian author Machado de Assis, who made use of the digressive technique in the novel \"The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas\". \"Tristram Shandy\", in which Sterne manipulates narrative time and voice, parodies accepted narrative form, and includes a healthy dose of bawdy humour, was largely dismissed in England as being too corrupt. Samuel Johnson's verdict in 1776 was that \"Nothing odd will do long. \"Tristram Shandy\" did not last.\"\n\nThis is strikingly different from the views of European critics of the day, who praised Sterne and \"Tristram Shandy\" as innovative and superior. Voltaire called it \"clearly superior to Rabelais\", and later Goethe praised Sterne as \"the most beautiful spirit that ever lived\". Both during his life and for a long time after, efforts were made by many to reclaim Sterne as an arch-sentimentalist; parts of \"Tristram Shandy\", such as the tale of Le Fever, were excerpted and published separately to wide acclaim from the moralists of the day. The success of the novel and its serialised nature also allowed many imitators to publish pamphlets concerning the Shandean characters and other Shandean-related material even while the novel was yet unfinished.\n\nThe title page to Vols. 1 and 2 is, for the most part, typical for an English novel of its time. It is distinguished only by a short Greek epigraph, which in English reads: \"Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men.\" Before the novel properly begins, Sterne also offers a highly complimentary dedication to \"Mr. Pitt\" (i.e., Lord William Pitt, 1708–1778). He urges Pitt to accept the book as a humble token of the author's admiration, in the hope that its amusing contents will provide relief from the cares of statecraft.\n\nThe novel itself starts with the narration, by Tristram, of his own conception. It proceeds by fits and starts, but mostly by what Sterne calls \"progressive digressions\" so that we do not reach Tristram's birth before the third volume. The novel is rich in characters and humour, and the influences of Rabelais and Miguel de Cervantes are present throughout. The novel ends after 9 volumes, published over a decade, but without anything that might be considered a traditional conclusion. Sterne inserts sermons, essays and legal documents into the pages of his novel; and he explores the limits of typography and print design by including marbled pages and an entirely black page within the narrative. Many of the innovations that Sterne introduced, adaptations in form that were an exploration of what constitutes the novel, were highly influential to Modernist writers like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, and more contemporary writers such as Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace. Italo Calvino referred to \"Tristram Shandy\" as the \"undoubted progenitor of all avant-garde novels of our century\". The Russian Formalist writer Viktor Shklovsky regarded \"Tristram Shandy\" as the archetypal, quintessential novel, of which all other novels are mere subsets: \"\"Tristram Shandy\" is the most typical novel of world literature.\"\n\nHowever, the leading critical opinions of \"Tristram Shandy\" tend to be markedly polarised in their evaluations of its significance. Since the 1950s, following the lead of DW Jefferson, there are those who argue that, whatever its legacy of influence may be, \"Tristram Shandy\" in its original context actually represents a resurgence of a much older, Renaissance tradition of \"Learned Wit\"—owing a debt to such influences as the Scriblerian approach.\n\n\"A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\" is a less influential book, although it was better received by English critics of the day. The book has many stylistic parallels with \"Tristram Shandy\", and indeed, the narrator is one of the minor characters from the earlier novel. Although the story is more straightforward, \"A Sentimental Journey\" can be understood to be part of the same artistic project to which \"Tristram Shandy\" belongs.\n\nTwo volumes of Sterne's \"Sermons\" were published during his lifetime; more copies of his \"Sermons\" were sold in his lifetime than copies of \"Tristram Shandy\", and for a while he was better known in some circles as a preacher than as a novelist. The sermons, though, are conventional in both style and substance. Several volumes of letters were published after his death, as was \"Journal to Eliza\", a more sentimental than humorous love letter to a woman Sterne was courting during the final years of his life. Compared to many eighteenth-century authors, Sterne's body of work is quite small.\n\nIn 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, the composer and former slave Ignatius Sancho wrote to Sterne encouraging him to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.\nThat subject, handled in your striking manner, would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only one—Gracious God!—what a feast to a benevolent heart!\nIn July 1766 Sterne received Sancho's letter shortly after he had finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in \"Tristram Shandy\", wherein Tom described the oppression of a black servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon which he had visited. Sterne's widely publicised response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature:\nThere is a strange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me—but why her brethren?—or your’s, Sancho! any more than mine? It is by the finest tints, and most insensible gradations, that nature descends from the fairest face about St. James’s, to the sootiest complexion in Africa: at which tint of these, is it, that the ties of blood are to cease? and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale, ’ere mercy is to vanish with them?—but ’tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes, & then endeavor to make ’em so.Laurence Sterne, 27 July 1766\nHis works, first collected in 1779, were edited, with newly discovered letters, by JP Browne (London, 1873). A less complete edition was edited by G Saintsbury (London, 1894).

{"id": "17989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17989", "title": "Linear A", "text": "Linear A\n\nLinear A is a writing system used by the Minoans (Cretans) from 1800 to 1450 BCE to write the hypothesized Minoan language. Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. It was succeeded by Linear B, which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek. No texts in Linear A have been deciphered.\n\nLinear A belongs to a group of scripts that evolved independently of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian systems. During the second millennium BCE, there were four major branches: Linear A, Linear B, Cypro-Minoan, and Cretan hieroglyphic. In the 1950s, Linear B was deciphered as Mycenean Greek. Linear B shares many symbols with Linear A, and they may notate similar syllabic values. But neither those nor any other proposed readings lead to a language that scholars can read.\n\nMost hypotheses about the Linear A script and Minoan language start with Linear B.\n\nLinear A has hundreds of signs, believed to represent syllabic, ideographic, and semantic values in a manner similar to Linear B. While many of those assumed to be syllabic signs are similar to ones in Linear B, approximately 80% of Linear A's logograms are unique; the difference in sound values between Linear A and Linear B signs ranges from 9% to 13%. It primarily appears in the left-to-right direction, but occasionally appears as a right-to-left or boustrophedon script.\n\nLinear A may be divided into four categories:\nBULLET::::- Numerals and metrical signs,\nBULLET::::- phonetic signs,\nBULLET::::- ligatures and composite signs, and\nBULLET::::- ideograms.\nNumbers follow a decimal system, units are represented by vertical dashes, tens by horizontal dashes, hundreds by circles, and thousands by circles with rays. Specific signs that coincide with numerals are regarded as fractions.\n\nAn interesting feature is the recording of numbers in the script: The highest number recorded in known Linear A texts is 3000, but there are special symbols to indicate fractions and weights.\n\n+ Linear A: signary and numbering according to E. Bennett. Reading of signs is based on Linear B analogs.\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *01-*20\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *21-*30\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *31-*53\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *54-*74\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *76-*122\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  *123-*306\n\n\"*01\"\n\n\"*21\"\n\n\"*31\"\n\n\"*54\"\n\n\"*76\"\n\n\"*123\"\n\n\"*02\"\n\n\"*21\"\n\n\"*34\"\n\n\"*55\"\n\n\"*77\"\n\n\"*131a\"\n\n\"*03\"\n\n\"*21\"\n\n\"*37\"\n\n\"*56\"\n\n\"*78\"\n\n\"*131b\"\n\n\"*04\"\n\n\"*22\"\n\n\"*38\"\n\n\"*57\"\n\n\"*79\"\n\n\"*131c\"\n\n\"*05\"\n\n\"*22\"\n\n\"*39\"\n\n\"*58\"\n\n\"*80\"\n\n\"*164\"\n\n\"*06\"\n\n\"*22\"\n\n\"*40\"\n\n\"*59\"\n\n\"*81\"\n\n\"*171\"\n\n\"*07\"\n\n\"*23\"\n\n\"*41\"\n\n\"*60\"\n\n\"*82\"\n\n\"*180\"\n\n\"*08\"\n\n\"*23\"\n\n\"*44\"\n\n\"*61\"\n\n\"*85\"\n\n\"*188\"\n\n\"*09\"\n\n\"*24\"\n\n\"*45\"\n\n\"*65\"\n\n\"*86\"\n\n\"*191\"\n\n\"*10\"\n\n\"*26\"\n\n\"*46\"\n\n\"*66\"\n\n\"*87\"\n\n\"*301\"\n\n\"*11\"\n\n\"*27\"\n\n\"*47\"\n\n\"*67\"\n\n\"*100/<br>*102\"\n\n\"*302\"\n\n\"*13\"\n\n\"*28\"\n\n\"*49\"\n\n\"*69\"\n\n\"*118\"\n\n\"*303\"\n\n\"*16\"\n\n\"*28b\"\n\n\"*50\"\n\n\"*70\"\n\n\"*120\"\n\n\"*304\"\n\n\"*17\"\n\n\"*29\"\n\n\"*51\"\n\n\"*73\"\n\n\"*120b\"\n\n\"*305\"\n\n\"*20\"\n\n\"*30\"\n\n\"*53\"\n\n\"*74\"\n\n\"*122\"\n\n\"*306\"\n\nLinear A has been unearthed chiefly on Crete, but also at other sites in Greece, as well as Turkey and Israel. The extant corpus, comprising some 1,427 specimens totalling 7,362 to 7,396 signs, if scaled to standard type, would fit easily on two sheets of paper. Linear A has been written on various media, such as stone offering tables, gold and silver hairpins, and ceramics. The earliest inscriptions of Linear A come from Phaistos, in a layer dated at the end of the Middle Minoan II period: that is, no later than c. 1700 BCE. Linear A texts have been found throughout the island of Crete and also on some Aegean islands (Kythera, Kea, Thera, Melos), in mainland Greece (Ayos Stephanos), on the west coast of Asia Minor (Miletos, Troy), and in the Levant (Tel Haror).\n\nThe main discoveries of Linear A tablets have been at three sites on Crete:\nBULLET::::- Haghia Triada in the Mesara, 147 tablets\nBULLET::::- Zakros, on the east coast, 31 tablets\nBULLET::::- Khania, in the northwest, 94 tablets.\n\nDiscoveries have been made at the following locations on Crete:\n\nBULLET::::- Apoudoulou\nBULLET::::- Archanes\nBULLET::::- Arkalochori\nBULLET::::- Armenoi\nBULLET::::- Chania\nBULLET::::- Gournia\nBULLET::::- Hagia Triada (largest cache)\nBULLET::::- Kardamoutsa\nBULLET::::- Kato Simi (also spelled Kato Syme)\nBULLET::::- Knossos\nBULLET::::- Kophinas\nBULLET::::- Larani\nBULLET::::- Mallia\nBULLET::::- Mochlos (also spelled Mokhlos)\nBULLET::::- Mount Juktas (also spelled Iouktas)\nBULLET::::- Myrtos Pyrgos\nBULLET::::- Nerokourou\nBULLET::::- Palaikastro\nBULLET::::- Petras\nBULLET::::- Petsophas\nBULLET::::- Phaistos\nBULLET::::- Platanos\nBULLET::::- Poros, Heraklion\nBULLET::::- Prassa\nBULLET::::- Pseira\nBULLET::::- Psychro (also spelled Psykhro)\nBULLET::::- Pyrgos Tylissos\nBULLET::::- Sitia\nBULLET::::- Skhinias\nBULLET::::- Skotino cave\nBULLET::::- Traostalos\nBULLET::::- Troulos (or Trulos)\nBULLET::::- Vrysinas\nBULLET::::- Zakros\nUntil 1973, only one Linear A tablet had been found outside Crete (on Kea). Since then, other locations have yielded inscriptions.\n\nMost—if not all—inscriptions found outside Crete appear to have been made locally, as indicated by the composition of the substrate and other indications. Also, close analysis of the inscriptions found outside Crete indicates the use of a script that is somewhere between Linear A and Linear B, combining elements from both.\n\nBULLET::::- Kea\nBULLET::::- Kythera\nBULLET::::- Melos\nBULLET::::- Samothrace\nBULLET::::- Thera\n\nBULLET::::- Mycenae\nBULLET::::- Tiryns\nBULLET::::- Hagios Stephanos, Laconia\n\nLinear A became prominent during the Middle Minoan Period, specifically from 1625–1450 BCE. It was contemporary with and possibly derived from Cretan hieroglyphs, and is an ancestor of Linear B. The sequence and the geographical spread of Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A, and Linear B, the three overlapping but distinct writing systems on Bronze Age Crete and the Greek mainland, can be summarized as follows:\n\n! Writing system\n! Geographical area\n! Time span\nCretan Hieroglyphic\nCrete\n\nLinear A\nCrete, Aegean islands (Kea, Kythera, Melos, Thera), and Greek mainland (Laconia)\n\nLinear B\nCrete (Knossos), and mainland (Pylos, Mycenae, Thebes, Tiryns)\n\nArchaeologist Arthur Evans named the script \"Linear\" because its characters consisted simply of lines inscribed in clay, in contrast to the more pictographic characters in Cretan hieroglyphs that were used during the same period.\n\nSeveral tablets inscribed in signs similar to Linear A were found in the Troad in northwestern Anatolia. While their status is disputed, they may be imports, as there is no evidence of Minoan presence in the Troad. Classification of these signs as a unique Trojan script (proposed by contemporary Russian linguist Nikolai Kazansky) is not accepted by other linguists.\n\nEgyptian evidence related to the Keftiu (Cretan/Crete) language consists of a spell against Asian chickenpox and a writing name exercise called Keftiu. The spell, probably originated from the reign of Amenhotep III (1390–1352 BCE), evolves as follows: \"sntÈkpwpyw yÈymªntÈÈrkkr\", or, in the vocal transliteration adopted by Wolfgang Helck: \"santaka pupiwa ya’ayamantarakú ka ra\".\n\nEgyptian writing of Keftiu (Cretan/Crete) names such as mÈddm, or \"mi-da\" is evidence for the language of the Keftiu, essentailly indicating that it contains Semitic vocabulary. (see below).\n\nIn 1945, E. Pugliese Carratelli first introduced the classification of Linear A and Linear B parallels. However, in 1961 W.C. Brice modified the Carratelli system that was based on a wider range of Linear A sources, but Brice did not suggest Linear B equivalents to the Linear A signs. Louis Godart and Jean-Pierre Olivier introduced in the 1985 \"Recueil des inscriptions en linéaire A (GORILA),\" based on E.L Bennett's standard numeration of the signs of Linear B, introduced a joint numeration of the Linear A and B signs. The Egyptian exercise in writing the names of Keftiu even informs us of another Minoan ethnic identity in the form of mÈddm whose first element cannot be associated with the name Midas, since it was already labeled by a linearly inscribed Hagia Triada (or HT 41.4) dating to c. 1350 BCE. This Egyptian evidence of the Keftiu language essentially indicates that words in its vocabulary are Semitic, but in the language predominantly of the Luwians. One might conclude from this that a Semitic language was used in Minoan Crete as a lingua franca for a largely Luwian population.\n\nThe majority of signs in the Linear A script appear to have graphical equivalents in the Linear B syllabary. Comparison of the Hagia Triada tablets HT 95 and HT 86 shows that they contain identical lists of words and some kind of phonetic alteration. Scholars that approached Linear A with the phonetic values of Linear B produced a series of identical words. The Linear B–Linear A parallels: ku-ku-da-ra, pa-i-to, ku-mi-na, di-de-ro →di-de-ru, qa-qa-ro→qa-qa-ru, a-ra-na-ro→a-ra-na-re.\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate a given analysis of Linear A as there is little point of reference for reading its inscriptions. The simplest approach to decipherment may be to presume that the values of Linear A match more or less the values given to the deciphered Linear B script, used for Mycenaean Greek.\n\nA characteristic of Minoan consonance is the lack of distinction between voice and voiceless in the velar and labial series. The distinction t / d reflected in the Linear A, Linear B and Cypriot is an example of speech stops.\n\nIn 1957, Bulgarian scholar Vladimir I. Georgiev published his \"Le déchiffrement des inscriptions crétoises en linéaire A\" (\"The decipherment of Cretan inscriptions in Linear A\") stating that Linear A contains Greek linguistic elements. Georgiev then published another work in 1963, titled \"Les deux langues des inscriptions crétoises en linéaire A\" (\"The two languages of Cretan inscriptions in Linear A\"), suggesting that the language of the Hagia Triada tablets was Greek but that the rest of the Linear A corpus was in Hittite-Luwian. In December 1963, Gregory Nagy of Harvard University developed a list of Linear A and Linear B terms based on the assumption \"that signs of identical or similar shape in the two scripts will represent similar or identical phonetic values\"; Nagy concluded that the language of Linear A bears \"Greek-like\" and Indo-European elements. Michael Ventris' decipherment of Linear B in 1952 suggests an old form of Greek: it is derived from Linear A. Therefore, we can assume that the signs related to the Linear A express the same value as the Linear B. In all Linear B values for related words give a large number of identical forms or identical root forms, but alternate with the final vowel, or almost identical forms among linear texts, mainly those of Hagia Triada.\n\nExtracting conclusions or arguments from a simple morphology can hardly be considered methodologically satisfactory. Yves Duhoux in the \"Linear A as Greek\" discussion at AEGEANET in March 1998:I would like to remind you of some basic facts related to the Greekness of Linear A's language: (1) The word for \"total\" is different in Linear A and in Linear B: LB \"to - so(- de)\"; LA > B \"ku-ro.\" (2) The Linear B language is significantly less \"prefixing\" than Linear A. (3) Votive Linear A texts, where we are pretty sure to have variant forms of the same \"word\", show morphological (I mean: grammatical) features totally different from Linear B. The conclusion must be that even if one can find some casual resemblances between words in both languages (remember this MUST statistically happen: e.g. English and Persian use the same word \"bad\" to express the meaning of BAD, although it is proven that both words have no genetic relation at all), they are probably structurally different.\n\nSince the late 1950s, some scholars have suggested that the Linear A language could be an Anatolian language.\n\nPalmer (1958) put forward a theory, based on Linear B phonetic values, suggesting that Linear A language could be related closely to Luwian. The theory, however, failed to gain universal support for the following reasons:\nBULLET::::- There is no remarkable resemblance between Minoan and Hitto-Luwian morphology.\nBULLET::::- None of the existing theories of the origin of Hitto-Luwian peoples and their migration to Anatolia (either from the Balkans or from the Caucasus) are related to Crete.\nBULLET::::- There was a lack of direct contact between Hitto-Luwians and Minoan Crete; the latter was never mentioned in Hitto-Luwian inscriptions. Small states located along the western coast of ancient Asia Minor were natural barriers between Hitto-Luwians and Minoan Crete.\nBULLET::::- Obvious anthropological differences between Hitto-Luwians and the Minoans may be considered as another indirect testimony against this hypothesis.\n\nThere are recent works focused on the Luwian connection, not in terms of the Minoan language being Anatolian, but rather in terms of possible borrowings from Luwian, including the origin of the writing system itself.\n\nIn an article from 2001, Margalit Finkelberg, Professor of Classics emerita at Tel Aviv University, demonstrated a \"high degree of correspondence between the phonological and morphological system of Minoan and that of Lycian\" and proposed that \"the language of Linear A is either the direct ancestor of Lycian or a closely related idiom.\"\n\nCyrus H. Gordon first proposed in 1966–1969 that the texts contained Semitic vocabulary that was based on the lexical items such as \"kull -.\" meaning 'all' (Akkadian \"kalu, kullatu,\" Hebrew \"kol\"). Gordon uses morphological evidence to suggest that \"u-\" serves as a prefix in Linear A like Semitic copula \"u-\". However, Gordon's copula \"u-\" is based on an incomplete word, and even if some of Gordon's identifications were true, a complete case for a Semitic language has not yet been built.\n\nIn 2001, the journal \"Ugarit-Forschungen\" published the article \"The First Inscription in Punic – Vowel Differences in Linear A and B\" by Jan Best, claiming to demonstrate how and why Linear A notates an archaic form of Phoenician. This was a continuation of attempts by Cyrus Gordon in finding connections between Minoan and West Semitic languages.\n\nAnother recent interpretation, based on the frequencies of the syllabic signs and on complete palaeographic comparative studies, suggests that the Minoan Linear A language belongs to the Indo-Iranian family of Indo-European languages. Studies by Hubert La Marle include a presentation of the morphology of the language, avoid the complete identification of phonetic values between Linear A and B, and also avoid comparing Linear A with Cretan hieroglyphs. La Marle uses the frequency counts to identify the type of syllables written in Linear A, and takes into account the problem of loanwords in the vocabulary.\n\nHowever, La Marle's interpretation of Linear A has been subject to some criticism; it was rejected by John Younger of the University of Kansas who showed that La Marle had invented at will erroneous and arbitrary new transcriptions, based on resemblances with many different script systems (as Phoenician, Hieroglyphic Egyptian, Hieroglyphic Hittite, Ethiopian, Cypro-Minoan, etc.), ignoring established evidence and internal analysis, while for some words La Marle proposes religious meanings inventing names of gods and rites. La Marle made a rebuttal in \"An answer to John G. Younger's remarks on Linear A\" in 2010.\n\nItalian scholar Giulio M. Facchetti attempted to link Linear A to the Tyrrhenian language family comprising Etruscan, Rhaetic, and Lemnian. This family is reasoned to be a pre-Indo-European Mediterranean substratum of the 2nd millennium BCE, sometimes referred to as Pre-Greek. Facchetti proposed some possible similarities between the Etruscan language and ancient Lemnian, and other Aegean languages like Minoan.\n\nMichael Ventris who (with John Chadwick) successfully deciphered Linear B also believed in a link between Minoan and Etruscan. The same perspective is supported by S. Yatsemirsky in Russia.\n\nAccording to Gareth Alun Owens, Linear A represents the Minoan language, which Owens classifies as a distinct branch of Indo-European potentially related to Greek, Sanskrit, Hittite, Latin, etc. At \"The Cretan Literature Centre\", Owens stated:Beginning our research with inscriptions in Linear A carved on offering tables found in the many peak sanctuaries on the mountains of Crete, we recognise a clear relationship between Linear A and Sanskrit, the ancient language of India. There is also a connection to Hittite and Armenian. This relationship allows us to place the Minoan language among the so-called Indo-European languages, a vast family that includes modern Greek and the Latin of Ancient Rome. The Minoan and Greek languages are considered to be different branches of Indo-European. The Minoans probably moved from Anatolia to the island of Crete about 10,000 years ago. There were similar population movements to Greece. The relative isolation of the population which settled in Crete resulted in the development of its own language, Minoan, which is considered different to Mycenaean. In the Minoan language (Linear A), there are no purely Greek words, as is the case in Mycenaean Linear B; it contains only words also found in Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin, i.e. sharing the same Indo-European origin. \n\nSome researchers suggest that a few words or word elements may be recognized, without (yet) enabling any conclusion about relationship with other languages. In general, they use analogy with Linear B in order to propose phonetic values of the syllabic sounds. John Younger, in particular, thinks that place names usually appear in certain positions in the texts, and notes that the proposed phonetic values often correspond to known place names as given in Linear B texts (and sometimes to modern Greek names). For example, he proposes that three syllables, read as \"KE-NI-SO\", might be the indigenous form of Knossos. Likewise, in Linear A, \"MA+RU\" is suggested to mean \"wool\", and to correspond both to a Linear B pictogram with this meaning, and to the classical Greek word μαλλός with the same meaning (in that case a loan word from Minoan).\n\nThe Linear A alphabet (U+10600–U+1077F) was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\nBULLET::::- Aegean numbers\nBULLET::::- Cypro-Minoan syllabary\nBULLET::::- Phaistos Disc\nBULLET::::- Arkalochori Axe\nBULLET::::- Dispilio Tablet\nBULLET::::- Youra Potsherds\n\nBULLET::::- Marangozis, John (2007). \"An introduction to Minoan Linear A\".

{"id": "17990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17990", "title": "LucasArts", "text": "LucasArts\n\nLucasArts Entertainment Company, LLC, d/b/a LucasArts, is an American video game publisher and licensor. Until 2013, it was also a video game developer. LucasArts is best known for its graphic adventure games, as well as games based on the \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" franchises. Its headquarters are in San Francisco, California.\n\nIt was founded in May 1982 by George Lucas as Lucasfilm Games, the video game development group of his film company, Lucasfilm. Lucas initially served as the company's chairman. During a 1990 reorganization of Lucas companies, the Lucasfilm Games division was renamed LucasArts.\n\nLucasArts was acquired by The Walt Disney Company through the acquisition of its parent company Lucasfilm in 2012. On April 3, 2013, Disney halted all internal development at LucasArts and laid off most of its staff. However, LucasArts remained open so that it could retain its function as a licensor.\n\nDevelopment of games based on the \"Star Wars\" license will be carried out by Electronic Arts, through an exclusive license, for the core gaming market. Disney Interactive Studios retained the ability to develop, and LucasArts retained the ability to license the franchise for the casual gaming market. Development of video games based upon other Lucasfilm properties will now be assumed by Disney Interactive Studios or licensed to third parties.\n\nIn 1979, George Lucas wanted to explore other areas of entertainment, and created the Lucasfilm Computer Division in 1979, which included a department for computer games (the Games Group) and another for graphics. The graphics department was spun off into its own corporation in 1982, ultimately becoming Pixar.\n\nThe Lucasfilm Games Group originally cooperated with Atari, which helped fund the video game group's founding, to produce video games. Though the group had spun out of Lucasfilm, the video game development license for Lucasfilm's \"Star Wars\" were held by Atari at the time, forcing the group to start with original concepts; Ron Gilbert, one of the group's first employees, believed that if the Lucasfilm Games Group had the rights for \"Star Wars\" from the start, they would have never branched into any new intellectual property.\n\nThe first products from the Games Group were unique action games like \"Ballblazer\" in 1984, and \"Rescue on Fractalus!\". Beta versions of both games were leaked to pirate bulletin boards exactly one week after Atari had received unprotected copies for a marketing review, and were in wide circulation months before the original release date. In 1984, they were released for the Atari 5200 under the Lucasfilm Games label. Versions for home computers were not released until 1985, by publisher Epyx. Lucasfilm's next two games were \"Koronis Rift\" and \"The Eidolon\". Their first games were only developed by Lucasfilm, and a publisher would distribute the games. Atari published their games for Atari systems, Activision and Epyx would do their computer publishing. \"Maniac Mansion\" was the first game to be published and developed by Lucasfilm Games.\n\nThe early charter of Lucasfilm Games was to make experimental, innovative, and technologically advanced video games. \"Habitat\", an early online role-playing game and one of the first to support a graphical front-end, was one such title. It was only released as a beta test in 1986 by Quantum Link, an online service for the Commodore 64. Quantum Link could not provide the bandwidth at the time to support the game, so the full Habitat was never released outside of the beta test. However, Lucasfilm Games recouped the cost of development by releasing a sized-down version called \"Club Caribe\" in 1988. Lucasfilm later licensed the software to Fujitsu, who released it in Japan as \"Fujitsu Habitat\" in 1990. Fujitsu later licensed Habitat for world-wide distribution, and released an updated version called \"WorldsAway\" in 1995. The latest iteration of Habitat is still called \"WorldsAway\", which can be found at MetroWorlds.\n\nInitially, the Games Group worked from Lucas' Skywalker Ranch near Nicasio, California. In 1990, in a reorganization of the Lucas companies, the Games Division of Lucasfilm became part of the newly created LucasArts Entertainment Company, together with Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound. Later ILM and Skywalker Sound were consolidated in Lucas Digital Ltd. and LucasArts became the official name of the former Games Division. During this, the division had moved out of Skywalker Ranch to near-by offices in San Rafael, California.\n\nAlso in 1990, LucasArts started to publish \"The Adventurer\", their own gaming magazine where one could read about their upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The final issue was published in 1996.\nIn the same year, Lucas Learning was created as a subsidiary of LucasArts, providing educational software for classrooms.\n\n\"iMUSE\" (\"Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine\") is an interactive music system used in a number of LucasArts video games. It synchronizes music with the visual action in the game, and transitions from one musical theme to another. iMUSE was developed in the early 1990s by composers Michael Land and Peter McConnell while working at LucasArts. The iMUSE system is patented by LucasArts, and was added to the SCUMM game engine in 1991. The first game to use iMUSE was \"\" and it has been used in all LucasArts adventure games since. It has also been used for some non-adventure LucasArts titles, including \"\" (DOS version), \"\" (DOS version), and \"\".\n\nThe first adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games was \"\" in 1986, based on the Lucasfilm movie of the same name. The 1987 title \"Maniac Mansion\" introduced SCUMM, the scripting language behind most of the company's later adventure offerings. The adventures released in the following years, such as \"Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders\" in 1988, \"\" in 1989, and the 1990 titles \"Loom\" and \"The Secret of Monkey Island\" helped Lucasfilm Games build a reputation as one of the leading developers in the genre. The original five adventure games created with SCUMM were released in a compilation titled \"LucasArts Classic Adventures\" in 1992.\n\nLucasArts was often referred to as one of the two big names in the field, competing with Sierra On-line as a developer of high quality adventures. The first half of the 1990s was the heyday for the company's adventure fame, with classic titles such as \"\" in 1991, \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" in 1992, \"\" and \"\" in 1993, and the 1995 titles \"Full Throttle\" and \"The Dig\".\n\nIn the latter half of the decade, the popularity of adventure games faded and the costs associated with game development increased as high-resolution art and C.D.-quality audio became standard fare. The P.C. market wanted titles that would show off expensive new graphics cards to best effect, a change replicated in the home console market as the 3D capabilities of the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64 dictated the nature of the majority of games produced for those platforms. The adventure genre failed to find popularity with the masses of new gamers.\n\nDespite their declining popularity, LucasArts still continued to release adventure titles. In 1997, \"The Curse of Monkey Island\", the last LucasArts adventure game to retain traditional two-dimensional graphics and point-and-click interface, was released. This was followed by \"Grim Fandango\" in 1998, LucasArts' first attempt to convert a 2D adventure to a 3D environment. The highly stylised visuals, superb voice acting and sophisticated writing earned Grim Fandango many plaudits, including GameSpot's Game of the Year award. \"Escape from Monkey Island\" (2000), the fourth installment in the \"Monkey Island\" series, featured the same control scheme as Grim Fandango, and was generally well received. It is the last original adventure game the company has released.\n\nTwo sequels to existing franchises, \"Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels\" and \"\", were announced to be in development but these projects were cancelled, in 2003 and 2004 respectively, before the games were finished. When the rights to the Sam & Max franchise expired in 2005, the creator of Sam & Max, Steve Purcell, regained ownership. He then licensed Sam & Max to Telltale Games to be developed into an episodic game. Telltale Games is made up primarily of former LucasArts employees who had worked on the Sam & Max sequel and were let go after the project was canceled.\n\nLucasArts halted adventure game development for the next five years, focusing instead on their \"Star Wars\" games. They remained silent and did not rerelease their old games on digital distribution platforms, as other studios were doing at the time. However, in 2002, the company pledged that at least 50% of its releases would have nothing to do with \"Star Wars\". It was not until 2009 that they returned to the genre. On June 1, 2009, LucasArts announced both \"The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition\", a high-definition remake of the original game with revised graphics, music and voice work, and \"Tales of Monkey Island\", a new episodic installment in the \"Monkey Island\" series that was developed by Telltale Games.\n\nThen, on July 6, 2009, they announced that they would be rereleasing a number of their classic games, including \"Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis\" and \"LOOM\", on Steam. The rereleases were, for the first time, native versions built for Microsoft Windows. This was the first time in many years that the studio had offered any support for its classic adventure titles.\n\nThe second game in the Monkey Island series also received a high-definition remake, entitled \"\" in 2010. Both Monkey Island special edition games were released in a compilation, \"Monkey Island Special Edition Collection\", exclusively in Europe in 2011.\n\nThe release of the unofficial SCUMM virtual machine, ScummVM, has led to something of a resurgence for LucasArts adventure games among present-day gamers. Using ScummVM, legacy adventure titles can easily be run on modern computers and even more unusual platforms such as video game consoles, mobile phones and PDAs.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lucasfilm Games developed a series of military vehicle simulation games, the first of which were the naval simulations \"PHM Pegasus\" in 1986 and \"Strike Fleet\" in 1987. These two titles were published by Electronic Arts for a variety of computer platforms, including PC, Commodore 64 and Apple II.\n\nIn 1988, \"Battlehawks 1942\" launched a trilogy of World War II air combat simulations, giving the player a chance to fly as an American or Japanese pilot in the Pacific Theater. Battlehawks 1942 was followed by \"\" in 1989, recreating the battle between the Luftwaffe and RAF for Britain's air supremacy. The trilogy ended with \"Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe\" in 1991, in which the player could choose to fly on either the American or German side. The trilogy was lauded for its historical accuracy and detailed supplementary material—Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe, for instance, was accompanied by a 224-page historical manual. The World War II trilogy was released with cover art by illustrator Marc Ericksen, in a compilation titled \"Air Combat Classics\" in 1994.\n\nThe World War II trilogy was created by a team led by Lawrence Holland, a game designer who later founded Totally Games. Totally Games would continue to develop games almost exclusively to LucasArts for a decade, with the most noted outcome of the symbiosis being . They were also responsible for LucasArts' 2003 return to the aerial battles of World War II with \"Secret Weapons Over Normandy\", a title released on PlayStation 2, Xbox and P.C.\n\nIn 1996, LucasArts released \"Afterlife\", a simulator in which players build their own Heaven and Hell, with several jokes and puns (such as a prison in Hell called San Quentin Tarantino).\n\nEven though LucasArts had created games based on other Lucasfilm properties before (\"Labyrinth\", \"Indiana Jones\"), they did not use the \"Star Wars\" license until the early 1990s: \"Star Wars\" games began appearing in the 1980s, but were developed by other companies for LucasArts because the license for the games had been sold before LucasArts was formed. The first in-house development was the space combat simulator \"\", developed by Larry Holland's independent team, which went on to spawn a .\n\nThe CD-ROM-only \"Star Wars\" game \"\" became one of the biggest successes of the company and was considered a killer app for CD-ROM drives in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter the unprecedented success of id Software's \"Doom\", the PC gaming market shifted towards production of three-dimensional first person shooters. LucasArts contributed to this trend with the 1995 release of \"\", a first person shooter that successfully transplanted the Doom formula to a Star Wars setting. The Dark Forces Strategy guide claims that development was well underway before Doom was released and that the game was pushed back once Doom hit shelves so that it could be polished. The game was well received and spawned a new franchise: the \"Jedi Knight\" games. This began with the sequel to \"Dark Forces\", \"\" released in 1997; this game reflected the changing face of PC gaming, being one of the first games to appreciably benefit when used in conjunction with a dedicated 3D graphics card like 3dfx's Voodoo range. The game received an expansion pack, \"Mysteries of the Sith\", in 1998 and a full sequel in 2002 with \"\". 2003's \"\" can be seen as a spin-off from the series, but was less well received by reviewers, who complained that the franchise was becoming formulaic.\n\nApart from \"Star Wars\"-themed 3D shooters, LucasArts also created the western-themed game \"Outlaws\" in 1997 and \"Armed and Dangerous\" (in collaboration with Planet Moon Studios) in 2003.\n\nIn 2000, Simon Jeffery became the LucasArts president. He was president of LucasArts until 2003 and some successful Star Wars games released during his management like Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2, Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars Jedi Academy and Star Wars Galaxies. Development of some other successful Star Wars Games began during his management, like \"Star Wars Republic Commando\" and \"Star Wars Battlefront\".\n\nIn 2002, LucasArts recognized that the over-reliance on Star Wars was reducing the quality of its output, and announced that future releases would be at least 50% non-Star Wars-related. However, many of the original titles were either unsuccessful or even cancelled before release, and since then LucasArts again had mainly Star Wars titles in production.\n\nAlso in 2002, LucasArts released a compilation CD filled with music from their past games. The album is titled \"The Best of LucasArts Original Soundtracks\" and features music from the \"Monkey Island\" series, \"Grim Fandango\", \"Outlaws\", and \"The Dig\".\n\n2003 saw the fruitful collaboration of LucasArts and BioWare on the well reviewed role-playing game, \"\". Combining modern 3D graphics with high-quality storytelling and a sophisticated role-playing game system, this game reinvigorated the Star Wars franchise. Its 2004 sequel \"\" continued in the same vein, but LucasArts was criticized for forcing the developer Obsidian Entertainment to release the sequel unfinished, resulting in a significant amount of cut content, a disappointing ending and numerous bugs.\n\nIn 2003, LucasArts and the Star Wars franchise also branched out in a new direction—the world of the MMORPG, with the creation of \"Star Wars Galaxies\". After a successful launch, the first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was released in 2004. The new expansion featured the addition of real-time space combat. This was continued in \"Rage of the Wookiees\", an additional expansion which added an additional planet for users to explore. Also, a new expansion, \"Trials of Obi-Wan\" was released on November 1, 2005 consisting of several new missions focusing on the Episode 3 planet, Mustafar. While \"Star Wars Galaxies\" still retains a devoted following, it has also alienated many players. \"Star Wars Galaxies\" has chosen to ignore the timeline established in the original films, during which the game is set, and has allowed players to play as Jedi characters. The game has also undergone several major redesigns, which have been received with mixed reactions by players.\n\nIn April 2004, Jim Ward, V.P. of marketing, online and global distributions at Lucasfilm, was appointed president of LucasArts. Ward performed a top-to-bottom audit of LucasArts infrastructure, describing the company's state as \"quite a mess.\" In 2003, LucasArts had reportedly grossed just over $100,000,000 according to N.P.D., primarily from its \"Star Wars\" titles — significantly less than the grosses from the year's top single titles such as \"\". Ward produced a five-year investment plan to refit the company. Previous \"Star Wars\" games had been produced by external developers such as Raven Software, BioWare and Obsidian; Ward now prioritized making LucasArts' internal game development work effectively and adapt to the evolving game industry. \"\", \"\", and \"\" survived cuts that closed down other in-development games and reduced staff from about 450 to 190 employees.\n\nWard also canceled Star Wars Rogue Squadron Trilogy which was 50% completed and it was going to be released on the Xbox in 2004.\n\nFactor 5 was going to develop a Rogue Squadron game titled Rogue Squadron: X-Wing vs Tie Fighter for the Xbox 360 but it was canceled by LucasArts.\n\nAfter Factor 5's exclusivity with Sony ended they decided to release Rogue Squadron Trilogy for the Wii, but it was eventually cancelled as well.\n\nIn 2004, LucasArts released \"\", based on the same formula as the popular \"Battlefield\" series of games. It ended up becoming the best-selling \"Star Wars\" game of all time to that point, aided by a marketing tie-in with the original trilogy D.V.D. release. Its sequel, \"\", was released on November 1, 2005 and featured new locales such as Episode III planets Mustafar, Mygeeto, etc., in addition to space combat, playable Jedi, and new special units like Bothan spies and Imperial officers. In this same year, the second \"Knights of the Old Republic\" game was in production. LucasArts told Obsidian Entertainment that the project needed to be finished by that year's holiday season. Obsidian was forced to cut huge amounts of content from the game, resulting in a rushed, unfinished Knights of the Old Republic II.\n\nIn March 2005, LucasArts published \"\", the first game in the popular Lego video game franchise by Traveller's Tales. It was based on the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy. In May 2005, LucasArts released \"\", a third person action game based on the film. Also in 2005, LucasArts released \"\", and one of their few non-\"Star Wars\" games, \"\", developed by Pandemic Studios.\n\nOn February 16, 2006, LucasArts released \"\", a real-time strategy game developed by Petroglyph. September 12, 2006 saw the release of \"\", the sequel to the popular \"Lego Star Wars: The Video Game\". \"Lego Star Wars II\", once again developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts, follows the same basic format as the first game, but, as the name indicates, covers the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\n\nA game titled \"Traxion\" was announced. \"Traxion\" was a rhythm game which was under development for the PlayStation Portable by British developer Kuju Entertainment, scheduled to be released in Q4 2006 by LucasArts, but was instead cancelled in January 2007. The game was to feature a number of minigames, and would support imported songs from the player's own mp3 library as well as the game's bundled collection.\n\nIn May 2007, LucasArts announced \"Fracture\" and stated that \"new intellectual properties serve a vital role to the growth of LucasArts\". \"\" was labelled the number one new IP in 2005 and Thrillville the number one new children's IP in 2006. Fracture was released on October 7, 2008 to average reviews. \"\" was released on January 11, 2005 to critical and commercial success which led to a sequel, \"\". \"Thrillville\" was released on November 21, 2006, and \"\" was released on October 16, 2007.\n\nOn September 16, 2008, \"\" was released to mixed reviews, though it quickly became the fastest selling \"Star Wars\" game of all time.\n\nThe rapid scaling down of internal projects at LucasArts was also reflected in its handling of games developed by external developers. During the tenure of Ward, Free Radical was contracted to produce \"Star Wars: Battlefront III\", which had been in production for 2 years. Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis described how working with LucasArts evolved from being \"the best relationship we'd ever had with a publisher\" to withholding money for 6 months and abusing the independent developer's position to withhold the full project cancellation fee—this was a major event which contributed towards Free Radical entering administration.\n\nWard left the company in early February 2008, for personal reasons. He was replaced by Howard Roffman as interim president. Darrell Rodriguez, who came from Electronic Arts, took Roffman's place in April 2008. About a month prior to release of \"\", LucasArts scaled down the internal development studio. The aforementioned game received a mediocre score from some media outlets such as IGN, GameSpot and GameTrailers. After release, minor adjustment in staffing resulted in even more layoffs.\n\nThe successor to \"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords\", in the form of the MMORPG \"\", was announced on October 21, 2008, at an invitation-only press event. developed by BioWare. It was released in December 2011.\n\nThey also published \"\" in 2009 for all current systems. The game is a tie-in to \"\" television series and was released on October 6, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews.\n\nDuring television network G4's coverage of the 2006 E3 Convention, a LucasArts executive was asked about the return of popular franchises such as \"Monkey Island\". The executive responded that the company was currently focusing on new franchises, and that LucasArts may return to the \"classic franchises\" in 2015, though it was unclear as to whether the date was put forwards as an actual projection, or hyperbole. This turned out to be hyperbole, as LucasArts and Telltale Games announced new adventure games in a joint press release in 2009. The games announced were \"Tales of Monkey Island\", which was to be developed by Telltale, and a LucasArts-developed enhanced remake of the 1990 title \"The Secret of Monkey Island\", with the intent of bringing the old game to a new audience. According to LucasArts, this announcement was \"just the start of LucasArts’ new mission to revitalize its deep portfolio of beloved gaming franchises\". Following the success of this, LucasArts released the sequel, \"\" in the summer of 2010.\n\nThe company began experiencing turnovers in layoffs in 2010. Rodriguez left in May after just two years on the job. A Lucasfilm board of Directors and a game industry veteran, Jerry Bowerman, filled in during the transition. Rodriguez was ultimately replaced in June by Paul Meegan, formerly of Gears of War developer Epic Games.\n\nIn July 2010, Haden Blackman, who served as creative director on the original \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\", LucasArts' most successful internally produced title of recent years, and the sequel, unexpectedly left. However, the company scored a surprise coup in August 2010 when Clint Hocking, a high-profile game director from Ubisoft, announced that he would be joining LucasArts. His tenure at LucasArts was short lived however, as Hocking left LucasArts in June 2012 before the game he was working on was released. In September 2010, a third of the employees at LucasArts were fired.\n\nIn March 2011, LucasArts published a sequel to the popular Lego Star Wars series, \"\", based on the , once again developed by Traveller's Tales. Sony Online Entertainment announced in June 2011 that Star Wars Galaxies would be shutting down at the end of 2011. Its services were terminated on December 15, 2011.\n\nAnother canceled title of Lucasarts was a Darth Maul game which was going to be developed by the same company which made the Wii version of The Force Unleashed II.\n\nOn April 26, 2011, LucasArts announced that it had acquired a license from Epic Games to develop a number of future titles using the Unreal Engine 3 for a number of platforms. \"Star Wars 1313\", a proposed action-adventure about Boba Fett navigating Coruscant's subterranean underworld, was confirmed to use the Unreal Engine 3. However, the game was cancelled as a result of the closure of the development arm of LucasArts.\n\nIn April 2012, LucasArts published \"Kinect Star Wars\", developed by Terminal Reality, for the Xbox 360. It was poorly reviewed by critics, receiving an aggregated score of 53.32% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.\n\nIn August 2012, Meegan, who replaced Rodriguez as president in 2010, also left his position at LucasArts after just two years on the job. Kevin Parker and Gio Corsi were named to co-lead the studio until the studio would choose a permanent president, with the former as interim head of business operations and the latter as interim head of studio production.\n\nThe last game released through LucasArts as a subsidiary of an independent Lucasfilm was \"Angry Birds Star Wars\", a game that gave the \"Angry Birds\" characters costumes and abilities based on the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. It was released on November 8, 2012, before the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm was finalized. The game was developed and published by Rovio Entertainment, and licensed by LucasArts.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, LucasArts was acquired by The Walt Disney Company through the acquisition of its parent company Lucasfilm in a deal for $4.05 billion. A Disney representative stated that its intent at the time was for all employees at Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries to remain at their present positions. A LucasArts representative said that \"for the time being, all projects are business as usual\".\n\nOn December 4, 2012, the acquisition of Lucasfilm was approved by the Federal Trade Commission, allowing the deal to be finalized without dealing with antitrust problems. On December 21, 2012, the deal was completed, and Lucasfilm and all of its subsidiaries became wholly owned by Disney.\n\nInformation that surfaced in March 2013 suggested that \"Star Wars\" games already in development, such as \"Star Wars 1313\" and \"First Assault\", may have been put on hold in order to put more focus on \"\". At the time, LucasArts also had three untitled games in development: an open-world RPG, an FPS, and an aerial combat game. According to a job listing posted via the Lucasfilm website, LucasArts was also planning on creating a new online service which they claimed would \"revolutionize the industry.\"\n\nOn April 3, 2013, Lucasfilm confirmed that LucasArts would cease to operate as a video game developer. Future video games based on its properties will either be developed by Disney Interactive Studios or licensed to third-party developers. As a result, all of its future internal projects were cancelled, and most of its staff were laid off from the company. However, LucasArts remained open with a skeleton staff of fewer than ten employees so it could retain its function as a video game licensor. Disney indicated that the new business model would \"[minimize] the company's risk while achieving a broad portfolio of quality \"Star Wars\" games.\" Around 150 staff members lost their jobs as a result of the closure. The layoffs at LucasArts also resulted in layoffs at fellow visual effects subsidiary Industrial Light & Magic; as many of LucasArts' employees also worked for ILM, the company was left overstaffed.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, it was revealed that Electronic Arts would develop \"Star Wars\" games, through an exclusive multi-year license, for the core gaming market. But the agreement allowed Disney Interactive Studios to further develop for the casual gaming market of \"mobile, social, tablet and online game categories\", and LucasArts to further license the franchise. On July 15, 2013, a sequel to \"Angry Birds Star Wars\" based on the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy, titled \"Angry Birds Star Wars II\", was announced. It was the first game released through LucasArts under Disney ownership when it launched for mobile platforms on September 18, 2013.\n\nOn October 4, 2013, Disney Interactive announced \"\", a \"Star Wars\" game for mobile devices based on Tiny Tower. It was developed by Disney Mobile and NimbleBit, and was published by LucasArts for mobile devices on November 8, 2013. On December 17, 2013, Disney Interactive announced \"\", a \"Star Wars\" space combat simulation game developed by Area 52 games in conjunction with Disney Mobile and LucasArts. A closed beta period began in North America on January 14, 2014.\n\nThe first \"Star Wars\" game announced under Electronic Arts' exclusive license was \"Star Wars Battlefront\", a reboot of the , developed by DICE. The game was released in the third quarter of 2015. The second game by Electronic Arts under their Star Wars license was a free to play mobile game titled \"\". It was announced at the 2015 E3 Expo, where it was announced as a collectible card game RPG. The game received a soft launch in Australia during October 2015, and was formally released on November 24, 2015. On May 10, 2016, a sequel to the 2015 reboot of the Star Wars Battlefront series was announced, featuring content from the sequel trilogy of films. It was released on November 17, 2017.\n\nAt the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony Computer Entertainment announced \"Grim Fandango Remastered\", developed by Double Fine Productions as a console exclusive for PlayStation platforms. It was released in 2015 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS. During Sony's new PlayStation Experience convention in 2014, another remaster by Double Fine, \"Day of the Tentacle Remastered\", was announced. It was released in March 2016 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. At the 2015 PlayStation Experience, another remastered game by Double Fine was announced, \"Full Throttle Remastered\". It was released in April 2017 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux.\n\nEx-LucasArts developers have founded numerous San Francisco game development studios such as Double Fine Productions (2000), Telltale Games (2004), MunkyFun (2008), Dynamighty (2011), SoMa Play (2013), and Fifth Journey (2015) playing a significant role in the continued development of computer games in the Bay Area.\n\nThe original Lucasfilm Games logo was based upon the existing Lucasfilm movie logo. There were a number of variations on it. The last game to feature the original “Gold Guy” was Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith and in late 2005 they changed the logo. The new logo was first seen in Star Wars Battlefront II (2005)\nThe long-lived LucasArts logo, affectionately known as the \"Gold Guy\", was introduced in 1990 and first used within \"Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge\" (the first game shipped under the LucasArts name). The logo consisted of a crude gold-colored figure resembling a petroglyph, standing on a purple letter \"L\" inscribed with the company name. The figure had its hands up in the air, as if a sun were rising from behind him. It was also said to resemble an eye, with the rays of the sun as eyelashes. The logo was revised in late 2005, losing the letter \"L\" pedestal and introducing a more rounded version of the gold-colored figure. In the games, the figure sometimes does an action like throw a lightsaber or cast Force Lightning.\nIn 1998, LucasArts approached Finnish game developer Remedy Entertainment, citing that their logo was copied from the top portion of the LucasArts logo, and threatened legal action. Remedy was by that time already in the process of redesigning their logo, so they complied by taking their old logo offline from their website, and introducing their new logo a little later.\nBULLET::::- List of LucasArts games\nBULLET::::- List of Star Wars video games\nBULLET::::- LucasArts adventure games\nBULLET::::- LucasArts Archives\nBULLET::::- Double Fine Productions\nBULLET::::- Humongous Entertainment\nBULLET::::- Telltale Games\nBULLET::::- SCUMM\nBULLET::::- GrimE\nBULLET::::- SITH\nBULLET::::- INSANE\nBULLET::::- 1982 in video gaming\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\nBULLET::::- The Workshop – Official LucasArts Blog\n"}
{"id": "17992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17992", "title": "Lafcadio Hearn", "text": "Lafcadio Hearn\n\nPatrick Lafcadio Hearn (; ; 27 June 1850 – 26 September 1904), known also by the Japanese name , was a writer, known best for his books about Japan, especially his collections of Japanese legends and ghost stories, such as \"\". In the United States, Hearn is also known for his writings about the city of New Orleans based on his ten-year stay in that city.\n\nBorn in Greece to a Greek mother and an Irish father, a complex series of conflicts and events led to young Lafcadio Hearn being moved to Ireland, where he was abandoned first by his mother (leaving him in the care of her husband's aunt), then his father and finally by his father's aunt, who had been appointed his official guardian. At the age of 19 he was put on a boat to the United States, where he found a job as newspaper reporter, first in Cincinnati, Ohio, and later in New Orleans. From there he was sent as a correspondent, first to the French West Indies, where he stayed for two years, and then to Japan, where he would remain for the rest of his life.\n\nIn Japan he married a Japanese woman with whom he had four children, and became a naturalized Japanese citizen. His writings about Japan offered the Western world a glimpse into a largely unknown but fascinating culture.\n\nHearn was born in and named after the island of Lefkada, one of the Greek Ionian Islands, on 27 June 1850. He was the son of British Army surgeon Charles Bush Hearn (of County Offaly, Ireland) and Rosa Antoniou Kassimatis, a Greek woman of noble Kytheran lineage through her father, Anthony Kassimatis. His father was stationed in Lefkada during the British proctectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands. Lafcadio was baptized Patricios Lefcadios Hearn (Πατρίκιος Λευκάδιος Χερν) in the Greek Orthodox Church, but he seems to have been called \"Patrick Lefcadio Kassimati Charles Hearn\" in English. Hearn's parents were married in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 25 November 1849, several months after his mother had given birth to the couple's first child, Hearn's older brother, George Robert Hearn, on 24 July 1849. George Hearn died on 17 August 1850, two months after Lafcadio's birth.\n\nHearn's father was promoted to Staff Surgeon Second Class and in 1850 was reassigned from Lefkada to the British West Indies. Since his family did not approve of the marriage, and worried that his relationship might harm his career prospects, Charles Hearn did not inform his superiors of his son or pregnant wife and left his family behind. In 1852, he arranged to send his son and wife to live with his family in Dublin, Ireland, where they received a cool reception. Charles Hearn's Protestant mother, Elizabeth Holmes Hearn, had difficulty accepting Rosa Hearn's Catholicism and lack of education (she was illiterate and spoke no English). Rosa found it difficult to adapt to a foreign culture and the Protestantism of her husband's family, and was eventually taken under the wing of Elizabeth's sister, Sarah Holmes Brenane, a widow who had converted to Catholicism.\n\nDespite Sarah Brenane's efforts, Rosa suffered from homesickness. When her husband returned to Ireland on medical leave in 1853, it became clear that the couple had become estranged. Charles Hearn was assigned to the Crimean Peninsula, again leaving his pregnant wife and child in Ireland. When he came back in 1856, severely wounded and traumatized, Rosa had returned to her home island of Cerigo in Greece, where she gave birth to their third son, Daniel James Hearn. Lafcadio had been left in the care of Sarah Brenane.\n\nCharles Hearn petitioned to have the marriage with Rosa annulled, on the basis of her lack of signature on the marriage contract, which made it invalid under English law. After being informed of the annulment, Rosa almost immediately married Giovanni Cavallini, a Greek citizen of Italian ancestry who was later appointed by the British as governor of Cerigotto. Cavallini required as a condition of the marriage that Rosa give up custody of both Lafcadio and James. As a result, James was sent to his father in Dublin and Lafcadio remained in the care of Sarah Brenane (Brenane had disinherited Charles Hearn because of the annulment). Neither Lafcadio nor James saw their mother again, who had four children with her second husband. Rosa was eventually committed to the National Mental Asylum on Corfu, where she died in 1882.\n\nCharles Hearn, who had left Lafcadio in the care of Sarah Brenane for the past 4 years, now appointed her as Lafcadio's permanent guardian. He married his childhood sweetheart, Alicia Goslin, in July 1857, and left with his new wife for a posting in Secunderabad, where they had three daughters prior to Alicia's death in 1861. Lafcadio never saw his father again: Charles Hearn died of malaria in the Gulf of Suez in 1866.\n\nIn 1857, at age seven and despite the fact that both his parents were still alive, Hearn became the permanent ward of his great aunt, Sarah Brenane. She divided her residency between Dublin in the winter months, her husband's estate at Tramore, County Waterford on the southern Irish coast, and a house at Bangor, North Wales. Brenane also engaged a tutor during the school year to provide basic instruction and the rudiments of Catholic dogma. Hearn began exploring Brenane's library and read extensively in Greek literature, especially myths.\n\nIn 1861, Hearn's aunt, aware that Hearn was turning away from Catholicism, and at the urging of Henry Hearn Molyneux, a relative of her late husband and a distant cousin of Hearn, enrolled him at the \"Institution Ecclésiastique\", a Catholic church school in Yvetot, France. Hearn's experiences at the school confirmed his lifelong conviction that Catholic education consisted of \"conventional dreariness and ugliness and dirty austerities and long faces and Jesuitry and infamous distortion of children's brains.\" Hearn became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant.\n\nIn 1863, again at the suggestion of Molyneux, Hearn was enrolled at St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. In this environment, Hearn adopted the nickname \"Paddy\" to try to fit in better, and was the top student in English composition for three years. At age 16, while at Ushaw, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard mishap. The eye became infected and, despite consultations with specialists in Dublin and London, and a year spent out of school convalescing, went blind. Hearn also suffered from severe myopia, so his injury left him permanently with poor vision, requiring him to carry a magnifying glass for close work and a pocket telescope to see anything beyond a short distance (Hearn avoided eyeglasses, believing they would gradually weaken his vision further). The iris was permanently discolored, and left Hearn self-conscious about his appearance for the rest of his life, causing him to cover his left eye while conversing and always posing for the camera in profile so that the left eye was not visible.\n\nIn 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane's financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. There was no money for tuition, and Hearn was sent to London's East End to live with Brenane's former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.\n\nBy 1869, Henry Molyneux had recovered some financial stability and Brenane, now 75, was infirm. Resolving to end his expenditures on the 19-year-old Hearn, he purchased a one-way ticket to New York and instructed Hearn to find his way to Cincinnati, to locate Molyneux's sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and to obtain their assistance in making a living. Upon meeting Hearn in Cincinnati, the family had little assistance to offer: Cullinan gave him $5 and wished him luck in seeking his fortune. As Hearn would later write, \"I was dropped moneyless on the pavement of an American city to begin life.\"\n\nFor a time, he was impoverished, living in stables or store rooms in exchange for menial labor. He eventually befriended the English printer and communalist Henry Watkin, who employed him in his printing business, helped find him various odd jobs, lent him books from his library, including utopianists Fourier, Dixon and Noyes, and gave Hearn a nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his life, The Raven, from the Poe poem. Hearn also frequented the Cincinnati Public Library, which at that time had an estimated 50,000 volumes. In the spring of 1871 a letter from Henry Molyneux informed him of Sarah Brenane's death and Molyneux's appointment as sole executor. Despite Brenane having named him as the beneficiary of an annuity when she became his guardian, Hearn received nothing from the estate and never heard from Molyneux again.\n\nBy the strength of his talent as a writer, Hearn obtained a job as a reporter for the \"Cincinnati Daily Enquirer\", working for the newspaper from 1872 to 1875. Writing with creative freedom in one of Cincinnati's largest circulating newspapers, he became known for his lurid accounts of local murders, developing a reputation as the paper's premier sensational journalist, as well as the author of sensitive accounts of some of the disadvantaged people of Cincinnati. \"The Library of America\" selected one of these murder accounts, \"Gibbeted,\" for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of \"American True Crime\", published in 2008. After one of his murder stories, the Tanyard Murder, had run for several months in 1874, Hearn established his reputation as Cincinnati's most audacious journalist, and the \"Enquirer\" raised his salary from $10 to $25 per week.\n\nIn 1874, Hearn and the young Henry Farny, later a renowned painter of the American West, wrote, illustrated, and published an 8-page weekly journal of art, literature and satire entitled \"Ye Giglampz.\" The Cincinnati Public Library reprinted a facsimile of all nine issues in 1983. The work was considered by a twentieth century critic to be \"Perhaps the most fascinating sustained project he undertook as an editor.\"\n\nOn 14 June 1874, Hearn, aged 23, married Alethea (\"Mattie\") Foley, a 20-year-old African American woman, an action in violation of Ohio's anti-miscegenation law at that time. In August 1875, in response to complaints from local clergyman about his anti-religious views and pressure from local politicians embarrassed by some of his satirical writing in \"Ye Giglampz,\" the \"Enquirer\" fired him, citing as its reason his illegal marriage. He went to work for the rival newspaper \"The Cincinnati Commercial.\" The \"Enquirer\" offered to re-hire him after his stories began appearing in the \"Commercial\" and its circulation began increasing, but Hearn, incensed at the paper's behavior, refused. Hearn and Foley separated, but attempted reconciliation several times before divorcing in 1877. Foley remarried in 1880.\n\nWhile working for the \"Commercial\" Hearn agreed to be carried to the top of Cincinnati's tallest building on the back of a famous steeplejack, Joseph Roderiguez Weston, and wrote a half-terrified, half-comic account of the experience. It was also during this time that Hearn wrote a series of accounts of the Bucktown and Levee neighborhoods of Cincinnati, \"...one of the few depictions we have of black life in a border city during the post-Civil War period.\" He also wrote about local black song lyrics from the era, including a song titled \"Shiloh\" that was dedicated to a Bucktown resident named \"Limber Jim.\" In addition, Hearn had printed in the \"Commercial\" a stanza he had overheard when listening to the songs of the roustabouts, working on the city's levee waterfront. Similar stanzas were recorded in song by Julius Daniels in 1926 and Tommy McClennan in his version of \"Bottle Up and Go\" (1939). \n\nDuring the autumn of 1877, recently divorced from Mattie Foley and restless, Hearn had begun neglecting his newspaper work in favor of translating into English works of the French author Gautier. He had also grown increasingly disenchanted with Cincinnati, writing to Henry Watkin, \"It is time for a fellow to get out of Cincinnati when they begin to call it the Paris of America.\" With the support of Watkin and \"Cincinnati Commercial\" publisher Murat Halstead, Hearn left Cincinnati for New Orleans, where he initially wrote dispatches on the \"Gateway to the Tropics\" for the \"Commercial\".\n\nHearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade, writing first for the newspaper \"Daily City Item\" beginning in June 1878, and later for the \"Times Democrat\". Since the \"Item\" was a 4-page publication, Hearn's editorial work changed the character of the newspaper dramatically. He began at the \"Item\" as a news editor, expanding to include book reviews of Bret Harte and Émile Zola, summaries of pieces in national magazines such as \"Harper's\", and editorial pieces introducing Buddhism and Sanskrit writings. As editor, Hearn created and published nearly two hundred woodcuts of daily life and people in New Orleans, making the \"Item\" the first Southern newspaper to introduce cartoons and giving the paper an immediate boost in circulation. Hearn gave up carving the woodcuts after six months when he found the strain was too great for his eye.\n\nAt the end of 1881, Hearn took an editorial position with the New Orleans \"Times Democrat\" and was employed translating items from French and Spanish newspapers as well as writing editorials and cultural reviews on topics of his choice. He also continued his work translating French authors into English: Gérard de Nerval, Anatole France, and most notably Pierre Loti, an author who influenced Hearn's own writing style. Milton Bronner, who edited Hearn's letters to Henry Watkin, wrote: \"[T]he Hearn of New Orleans was the father of the Hearn of the West Indies and of Japan,\" and this view was endorsed by Norman Foerster. During his tenure at the \"Times Democrat\", Hearn also developed a friendship with editor Page Baker, who went on to champion Hearn's literary career; their correspondence is archived at the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections & Archives.\n\nThe vast number of his writings about New Orleans and its environs, many of which have not been collected, include the city's Creole population and distinctive cuisine, the French Opera, and Louisiana Voodoo. Hearn wrote enthusiastically of New Orleans, but also wrote of the city's decay, \"a dead bride crowned with orange flowers\".\n\nHearn's writings for national publications, such as \"Harper's Weekly\" and \"Scribner's Magazine\", helped create the popular reputation of New Orleans as a place with a distinct culture more akin to that of Europe and the Caribbean than to the rest of North America. Hearn's best-known Louisiana works include: \nBULLET::::- \"Gombo zhèbes: Little dictionary of Creole proverbs\" (1885)\nBULLET::::- \"La Cuisine Créole\" (1885), a collection of culinary recipes from leading chefs and noted Creole housewives who helped make New Orleans famous for its cuisine\nBULLET::::- \"Chita: A Memory of Last Island\" (1889), a novella based on the hurricane of 1856 first published in \"Harper's Monthly\" in 1888\n\nHearn also published in \"Harper's Weekly\" the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.\n\nAt the time he lived there, Hearn was little known, and even now he is little known for his writing about New Orleans, except by local cultural devotees. However, more books have been written about him than any former resident of New Orleans except Louis Armstrong.\n\nHearn's writings for the New Orleans newspapers included impressionistic descriptions of places and characters and many editorials denouncing political corruption, street crime, violence, intolerance, and the failures of public health and hygiene officials. Despite the fact that he is credited with \"inventing\" New Orleans as an exotic and mysterious place, his obituaries of the vodou leaders Marie Laveau and Doctor John Montenet are matter-of-fact and debunking. Selections of Hearn's New Orleans writings have been collected and published in several works, starting with \"Creole Sketches\" in 1924, and more recently in \"Inventing New Orleans: Writings of Lafcadio Hearn.\"\n\n\"Harper's\" sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique and in addition to his writings for the magazine, produced two books: \"Two Years in the French West Indies\" and \"Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave\", both published in 1890.\n\nIn 1890, Hearn went to Japan with a commission as a newspaper correspondent, which was quickly terminated. It was in Japan, however, that he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Through the goodwill of Basil Hall Chamberlain, Hearn gained a teaching position during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue, a town in western Japan on the coast of the Sea of Japan. The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old residence are still two of Matsue's most popular tourist attractions. During his fifteen-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsu, the daughter of a local samurai family, with whom he had four children. He became a naturalized Japanese, assuming the name Koizumi Yakumo, in 1896 after accepting a teaching position in Tokyo. After having been Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian, he became Buddhist.\n\nDuring late 1891, Hearn obtained another teaching position in Kumamoto, Kyūshū, at the Fifth Higher Middle School, where he spent the next three years and completed his book \"Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan\" (1894). In October 1894, he secured a journalism job with the English-language newspaper \"Kobe Chronicle\", and in 1896, with some assistance from Chamberlain, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, a job he had until 1903. In 1904, he was a professor at Waseda University.\n\nWhile in Japan he encountered the art of ju-jutsu which made a deep impression upon him:\n\nOn 26 September 1904, he died of heart failure at the age of 54 years. His grave is at the Zōshigaya Cemetery in Toshima, Tokyo.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Japan was still largely unknown and exotic to Westerners. However, with the introduction of Japanese aesthetics, particularly at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, Japanese styles became fashionable in Western countries. Consequently, Hearn became known to the world by his writings concerning Japan. In later years, some critics would accuse Hearn of exoticizing Japan, but because he offered the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji Era Japan, his work is generally regarded as having historical value.\n\nAdmirers of Hearn's work have included Ben Hecht, John Erskine, and Malcolm Cowley.\n\nThe Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi adapted four Hearn tales into his 1964 film, \"Kwaidan\". Some of his stories have been adapted by Ping Chong into his puppet theatre, including the 1999 \"Kwaidan\" and the 2002 \"OBON: Tales of Moonlight and Rain\".\n\nYone Noguchi is quoted as saying about Hearn, \"His Greek temperament and French culture became frost-bitten as a flower in the North.\"\n\nThere is also a cultural center named after Hearn at the University of Durham.\n\nHearn was a major translator of the short stories of Guy de Maupassant.\n\nThe first museum in Europe for Lafcadio Hearn was inaugurated in Lefkada, Greece, his birthplace, on 4 July 2014, as Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center. It contains early editions, rare books and Japanese collectibles. The visitors, through photos, texts and exhibits, can wander in the significant events of Lafcadio Hearn's life, but also in the civilizations of Europe, America and Japan of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries through his lectures, writings and tales. The municipalities of Kumamoto, Matsue, Shinjuku, Yaizu, Toyama University, the Koizumi family and other people from Japan and Greece contributed to the establishment of Lefcadio Hearn Historical Center.\n\nHe is also depicted as the main base for Yukari Yakumo and Maribel Hearn in Touhou Project games and audio CDs\n\nSource:\nBULLET::::- \"Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan\" (1894)\nBULLET::::- \"Out of the East: Reveries and Studies in New Japan\" (1895)\nBULLET::::- \"Kokoro: Hints and Echoes of Japanese Inner Life\" (1896)\nBULLET::::- \"Gleanings in Buddha-Fields: Studies of Hand and Soul in the Far East\" (1897)\nBULLET::::- \"The Boy who Drew Cats\", (1897)\nBULLET::::- \"Exotics and Retrospectives\" (1898)\nBULLET::::- \"Japanese Fairy Tales\" (1898, and sequels)\nBULLET::::- \"In Ghostly Japan\" (1899)\nBULLET::::- \"Shadowings\" (1900)\nBULLET::::- \"Japanese Lyrics\" (1900)\nBULLET::::- \"A Japanese Miscellany\" (1901)\nBULLET::::- \"Kottō: Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs\" (1902)\nBULLET::::- \"\" (1903, later made into the movie \"Kwaidan\" by Masaki Kobayashi)\nBULLET::::- \"Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation\" (1904)\nBULLET::::- \"The Romance of the Milky Way and other studies and stories\" (1905)\n\nBULLET::::- \"La Cuisine Creole: A Collection of Culinary Recipes\" (1885)\nBULLET::::- \"Gombo Zhèbes\": A Little Dictionary of Creole Proverbs, Selected from Six Creole Dialects.\" (1885)\nBULLET::::- \"Chita: A Memory of Last Island\" (1889)\nBULLET::::- \"Creole Sketches\" (1924, Houghton Mifflin)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Letters from the Raven; being the correspondence of Lafcadio Hearn with Henry Watkin\" (1907)\nBULLET::::- Includes \"Letters from the Raven\", \"Letters to a Lady\", \"Letters of Ozias Midwinter\"\nBULLET::::- \"Leaves from the Diary of an Impressionist\" (1911, Houghton Mifflin Company)\nBULLET::::- \"Interpretations of Literature\" (1915, Dodd, Mead and Company)\nBULLET::::- \"Karma\" (1918)\nBULLET::::- \"On Reading in Relation to Literature\" (1921, The Atlantic Monthly Press, Inc.)\nBULLET::::- \"Lectures on Shakespeare\" (1928, Hokuseido Press)\nBULLET::::- \"Insect-musicians and other stories and sketches\" (1929)\nBULLET::::- \"Japan's Religions: Shinto and Buddhism\" (1966)\nBULLET::::- \"Books and Habits; from the Lectures of Lafcadio Hearn\" (1968, Books for Libraries Press)\nBULLET::::- \"Writings from Japan: An Anthology\" (1984, Penguin Books)\nBULLET::::- \"Lafcadio Hearn's America: Ethnographic Sketches and Editorials\" (2002, University Press of Kentucky)\nBULLET::::- \"Lafcadio Hearn's Japan: An Anthology of His Writings on the Country and Its People\" (2007, Tuttle)\nBULLET::::- \"American Writings\" (2009, Library of America)\nBULLET::::- \"Insect Literature\" (2015, Swan River Press; for details, see Insects in literature)\n\nBULLET::::- \"One of Cleopatra's Nights and Other Fantastic Romances by Théophile Gautier\" (1882)\nBULLET::::- \"Tales from Theophile Gautier\" (1888)\nBULLET::::- \"The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard by Anatole France\" (1890)\nBULLET::::- \"The Temptation of Saint Anthony by Gustave Flaubert\" (1910)\nBULLET::::- \"Stories from Emile Zola\" (1935)\nBULLET::::- \"The tales of Guy de Maupassant\"(1964)\n\nBULLET::::- \"Stray Leaves From Strange Literature; Stories Reconstructed from the Anvari-Soheili, Baital Pachisi, Mahabharata, Pantchantra, Gulistan, Talmud, Kalewala, etc.\" (1884, James R.

{"id": "17994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17994", "title": "Learning theory (education)", "text": "Learning theory (education)\n\nLearning Theory describes how students absorb, process, and retain knowledge during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part in how understanding, or a world view, is acquired or changed and knowledge and skills retained.\n\nBehaviorists look at learning as an aspect of conditioning and advocate a system of rewards and targets in education. Educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behaviour is too narrow, and study the learner rather than their environment—and in particular the complexities of human memory. Those who advocate constructivism believe that a learner's ability to learn relies largely on what they already know and understand, and the acquisition of knowledge should be an individually tailored process of construction. Transformative learning theory focuses on the often-necessary change required in a learner's preconceptions and world view. Geographical learning theory focuses on the ways that contexts and environments shape the learning process.\n\nOutside the realm of educational psychology, techniques to directly observe the functioning of the brain during the learning process, such as event-related potential and functional magnetic resonance imaging, are used in educational neuroscience. The theory of multiple intelligences, where learning is seen as the interaction between dozens of different functional areas in the brain each with their own individual strengths and weaknesses in any particular human learner, has also been proposed, but empirical research has found the theory to be unsupported by evidence.\n\nPlato (428 BC–347 BC) proposed the question: How does an individual learn something new when the topic is brand new to that person? This question may seem trivial; however, think of a human like a computer. The question would then become: How does a computer take in any factual information without previous programming? Plato answered his own question by stating that knowledge is present at birth and all information learned by a person is merely a recollection of something the soul has already learned previously, which is called the Theory of Recollection or Platonic epistemology. This answer could be further justified by a paradox: If a person knows something, they don't need to question it, and if a person does not know something, they don't know to question it. Plato says that if one did not previously know something, then they cannot learn it. He describes learning as a passive process, where information and knowledge are ironed into the soul over time. However, Plato's theory elicits even more questions about knowledge: If we can only learn something when we already had the knowledge impressed onto our souls, then how did our souls gain that knowledge in the first place? Plato's theory can seem convoluted; however, his classical theory can still help us understand knowledge today.\n\nJohn Locke (1632–1704) offered an answer to Plato's question as well. John Locke offered the \"blank slate\" theory where humans are born into the world with no innate knowledge. He recognized that something had to be present, however. This something, to John Locke, seemed to be \"mental powers\". Locke viewed these powers as a biological ability the baby is born with, similar to how a baby knows how to biologically function when born. So as soon as the baby enters the world, it immediately has experiences with its surroundings and all of those experiences are being transcribed to the baby's \"slate\". All of the experiences then eventually culminate into complex and abstract ideas. This theory can still help teachers understand their students' learning today.\n\nThe term \"behaviorism\" was coined by John Watson (1878–1959). Watson believed the behaviorist view is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science with a goal to predict and control behavior. In an article in the \"Psychological Review\", he stated that, \"Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness.\"\n\nMethodological behaviorism is based on the theory of only explaining public events, or observable behavior. B.F. Skinner introduced another type of behaviorism called radical behaviorism, or the conceptual analysis of behavior, which is based on the theory of also explaining private events; particularly, thinking and feelings. Radical behaviorism forms the conceptual piece of behavior analysis.\n\nIn behavior analysis, learning is the acquisition of a new behavior through conditioning and social learning.\n\nThe three mains types of conditioning and learning:\nBULLET::::- Classical conditioning, where the behavior becomes a reflex response to an antecedent stimulus.\nBULLET::::- Operant conditioning, where antecedent stimuli results from the consequences that follow the behavior through a reward (reinforcement) or a punishment.\nBULLET::::- Social learning theory, where an observation of behavior is followed by modeling.\n\nIvan Pavlov discovered classical conditioning. He observed that if dogs come to associate the delivery of food with a white lab coat or the ringing of a bell, they produce saliva, even when there is no sight or smell of food. Classical conditioning considers this form of learning the same, whether in dogs or in humans. Operant conditioning reinforces this behavior with a reward or a punishment. A reward increases the likelihood of the behavior recurring, a punishment decreases its likelihood. Social learning theory observes behavior and is followed with modeling.\n\nThese three learning theories form the basis of applied behavior analysis, the application of behavior analysis, which uses analyzed antecedents, functional analysis, replacement behavior strategies, and often data collection and reinforcement to change behavior. The old practice was called behavior modification, which only used \"assumed\" antecedents and consequences to change behavior without acknowledging the conceptual analysis; analyzing the function of behavior and teaching of new behaviors that would serve the same function was never relevant in behavior modification.\n\nBehaviorists view the learning process as a change in behavior, and arrange the environment to elicit desired responses through such devices as behavioral objectives, Competency-based learning, and skill development and training. Educational approaches such as Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention, curriculum-based measurement, and direct instruction have emerged from this model.\n\nTransfer of learning is the idea that what one learns in school somehow carries over to situations different from that particular time and that particular setting. Transfer was amongst the first phenomena tested in educational psychology. Edward Lee Thorndike was a pioneer in transfer research. He found that though transfer is extremely important for learning, it is a rarely occurring phenomenon. In fact, he held an experiment where he had the subjects estimate the size of a specific shape and then he would switch the shape. He found that the prior information did not help the subjects; instead it impeded their learning.\n\nOne explanation of why transfer does not occur often involves surface structure and deep structure. The surface structure is the way a problem is framed. The deep structure is the steps for the solution. For example, when a math story problem changes contexts from asking how much it costs to reseed a lawn to how much it costs to varnish a table, they have different surface structures, but the steps for getting the answers are the same. However, many people are more influenced by the surface structure. In reality, the surface structure is unimportant. Nonetheless, people are concerned with it because they believe that it provides background knowledge on how to do the problem. Consequently, this interferes with their understanding of the deep structure of the problem. Even if somebody tries to concentrate on the deep structure, transfer still may be unsuccessful because the deep structure is not usually obvious. Therefore, surface structure gets in the way of people's ability to see the deep structure of the problem and transfer the knowledge they have learned to come up with a solution to a new problem.\n\nCurrent learning pedagogies focus on conveying rote knowledge, independent of the context that gives it meaning. Because of this, students often struggle to transfer this stand-alone information into other aspects of their education. Students need much more than abstract concepts and self-contained knowledge; they need to be exposed to learning that is practiced in the context of authentic activity and culture. Critics of situated cognition, however, would argue that by discrediting stand-alone information, the transfer of knowledge across contextual boundaries becomes impossible. There must be a balance between situating knowledge while also grasping the deep structure of material, or the understanding of how one arrives to know such information.\n\nSome theorists argue that transfer does not even occur at all. They believe that students transform what they have learned into the new context. They say that transfer is too much of a passive notion. They believe students, instead, transform their knowledge in an active way. Students don't simply carry over knowledge from the classroom, but they construct the knowledge in a way that they can understand it themselves. The learner changes the information they have learned to make it best adapt to the changing contexts that they use the knowledge in. This transformation process can occur when a learner feels motivated to use the knowledge—however, if the student does not find the transformation necessary, it is less likely that the knowledge will ever transform \n\nThere are many different conditions that influence transfer of learning in the classroom. These conditions include features of the task, features of the learner, features of the organization and social context of the activity. The features of the task include practicing through simulations, problem-based learning, and knowledge and skills for implementing new plans. The features of learners include their ability to reflect on past experiences, their ability to participate in group discussions, practice skills, and participate in written discussions. All the unique features contribute to a student's ability to use transfer of learning. There are structural techniques that can aid learning transfer in the classroom. These structural strategies include hugging and bridging.\n\nHugging uses the technique of simulating an activity to encourage reflexive learning. An example of the hugging strategy is when a student practices teaching a lesson or when a student role plays with another student. These examples encourage critical thinking that engages the student and helps them understand what they are learning—one of the goals of transfer of learning and desirable difficulties.\n\nBridging is when instruction encourages thinking abstractly by helping to identify connections between ideas and to analyze those connections. An example is when a teacher lets the student analyze their past test results and the way they got those results. This includes amount of study time and study strategies. Looking at their past study strategies can help them come up with strategies to improve performance. These are some of the ideas important to successful to hugging and bridging practices.\n\nThere are many benefits of transfer of learning in the classroom. One of the main benefits is the ability to quickly learn a new task. This has many real-life applications such as language and speech processing. Transfer of learning is also very useful in teaching students to use higher cognitive thinking by applying their background knowledge to new situations.\n\nCognitive theories grew out of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psychology was developed in Germany in the early 1900s by Wolfgang Kohler and was brought to America in the 1920s. The German word \"Gestalt\" is roughly equivalent to the English \"configuration\" or \"organization\" and emphasizes the whole of human experience. Over the years, the Gestalt psychologists provided demonstrations and described principles to explain the way we organize our sensations into perceptions. Max Wertheimer, one of the founding fathers of Gestalt Theory, observed that sometimes we interpret motion when there is no motion at all. For example: a powered sign used at a convenience store to indicate that the store is open or closed might be seen as a sign with \"flashing lights\". However, the lights are not actually flashing. The lights have been programmed to blink rapidly at their own individual pace. Perceived as a whole, the sign flashes. Perceived individually, the lights turn off and on at designated times. Another example of this would be a brick house: As a whole, it is viewed as a standing structure. However, it is actually composed of many smaller parts, which are individual bricks. People tend to see things from a holistic point of view rather than breaking it down into sub units.\n\nIn Gestalt theory, psychologists say that instead of obtaining knowledge from what's in front of us, we often learn by making sense of the relationship between what's new and old. Because we have a unique perspective of the world, humans have the ability to generate their own learning experiences and interpret information that may or may not be the same for someone else.\n\nGestalt psychologists criticize behaviorists for being too dependent on overt behavior to explain learning. They propose looking at the patterns rather than isolated events. Gestalt views of learning have been incorporated into what have come to be labeled \"cognitive theories\". Two key assumptions underlie this cognitive approach: that the memory system is an active organized processor of information and that prior knowledge plays an important role in learning. Gestalt theorists believe that for learning to occur, prior knowledge must exist on the topic. When the learner applies their prior knowledge to the advanced topic, the learner can understand the meaning in the advanced topic, and learning can occur. Cognitive theories look beyond behavior to consider how human memory works to promote learning, and an understanding of short term memory and long term memory is important to educators influenced by cognitive theory. They view learning as an internal mental process (including insight, information processing, memory and perception) where the educator focuses on building intelligence and cognitive development. The individual learner is more important than the environment.\n\nOnce memory theories like the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model and Baddeley's working memory model were established as a theoretical framework in cognitive psychology, new cognitive frameworks of learning began to emerge during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. Today, researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load and information processing theory. These theories of learning play a role in influencing instructional design. Cognitive theory is used to explain such topics as social role acquisition, intelligence and memory as related to age.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, situated cognition emerged as a theory that recognized current learning as primarily the transfer of decontextualized and formal knowledge. Bredo (1994) depicts situated cognition as \"shifting the focus from individual in environment to individual and environment\". In other words, individual cognition should be considered as intimately related with the context of social interactions and culturally constructed meaning. Learning through this perspective, in which known and doing become inseparable, becomes both applicable and whole.\n\nMuch of the education students receive is limited to the culture of schools, without consideration for authentic cultures outside of education. Curricula framed by situated cognition can bring knowledge to life by embedding the learned material within the culture students are familiar with. For example, formal and abstract syntax of math problems can be transformed by placing a traditional math problem within a practical story problem. This presents an opportunity to meet that appropriate balance between situated and transferable knowledge. Lampert (1987) successfully did this by having students explore mathematical concepts that are continuous with their background knowledge. She does so by using money, which all students are familiar with, and then develops the lesson to include more complex stories that allow for students to see various solutions as well as create their own. In this way, knowledge becomes active, evolving as students participate and negotiate their way through new situations.\n\nFounded by Jean Piaget, constructivism emphasizes the importance of the active involvement of learners in constructing knowledge for themselves. Students are thought to use background knowledge and concepts to assist them in their acquisition of novel information. On approaching such new information, the learner faces a loss of equilibrium with their previous understanding, and this demands a change in cognitive structure. This change effectively combines previous and novel information to form an improved cognitive schema. Constructivism can be both subjectively and contextually based. Under the theory of radical constructivism, coined by Ernst von Glasersfeld, understanding relies on one's subjective interpretation of experience as opposed to objective \"reality\". Similarly, William Cobern's idea of contextual constructivism encompasses the effects of culture and society on experience.\n\nConstructivism asks why students do not learn deeply by listening to a teacher, or reading from a textbook. To design effective teaching environments, it believes one needs a good understanding of what children already know when they come into the classroom. The curriculum should be designed in a way that builds on the pupil's background knowledge and is allowed to develop with them. Begin with complex problems and teach basic skills while solving these problems. The learning theories of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, and David A. Kolb serve as the foundation of the application of constructivist learning theory in the classroom. Constructivism has many varieties such as active learning, discovery learning, and knowledge building, but all versions promote a student's free exploration within a given framework or structure. The teacher acts as a facilitator who encourages students to discover principles for themselves and to construct knowledge by working answering open-ended questions and solving real-world problems. To do this, a teacher should encourage curiosity and discussion among his/her students as well as promoting their autonomy. In scientific areas in the classroom, constructivist teachers provide raw data and physical materials for the students to work with and analyze.\n\nTransformative learning theory seeks to explain how humans revise and reinterpret meaning. Transformative learning is the cognitive process of effecting change in a frame of reference. A frame of reference defines our view of the world. The emotions are often involved. Adults have a tendency to reject any ideas that do not correspond to their particular values, associations and concepts.\n\nOur frames of reference are composed of two dimensions: habits of mind and points of view. Habits of mind, such as ethnocentrism, are harder to change than points of view. Habits of mind influence our point of view and the resulting thoughts or feelings associated with them, but points of view may change over time as a result of influences such as reflection, appropriation and feedback. Transformative learning takes place by discussing with others the \"reasons presented in support of competing interpretations, by critically examining evidence, arguments, and alternative points of view\". When circumstances permit, transformative learners move toward a frame of reference that is more inclusive, discriminating, self-reflective, and integrative of experience.\n\nAmerican Universities such as Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and University of Southern California began offering majors and degrees dedicated to educational neuroscience or neuroeducation in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Such studies seek to link an understanding of brain processes with classroom instruction and experiences. Neuroeducation analyzes biological changes in the brain from processing new information. It looks at what environmental, emotional, and social situations best help the brain store and retain new information via the linking of neurons—and best keep the dendrites from being reabsorbed, losing the information. The 1990s were designated \"The Decade of the Brain\", and advances took place in neuroscience at an especially rapid pace. The three dominant methods for measuring brain activities are event-related potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG).\n\nThe integration and application to education of what we know about the brain was strengthened in 2000 when the American Federation of Teachers stated: \"It is vital that we identify what science tells us about how people learn in order to improve the education curriculum.\" What is exciting about this new field in education is that modern brain imaging techniques now make it possible, in some sense, to watch the brain as it learns, and the question then arises: can the results of neuro-scientific studies of brains as they are learning usefully inform practice in this area? The neuroscience field is young. Researchers expected that new technologies and ways of observing will produce new scientific evidence that helps refine the paradigms of what students need and how they learn best. In particular, it may bring more informed strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities.\n\nAll individuals have the ability to develop mental discipline and the skill of mindfulness, the two go hand in hand. Mental discipline is huge in shaping what people do, say, think and feel. It's critical in terms of the processing of information and involves the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to new things and information people come across, or have recently been taught. Mindfulness is important to the process of learning in many aspects. Being mindful means to be present with and engaged in whatever you are doing at a specific moment in time. Being mindful can aid in helping us to more critically think, feel and understand the new information we are in the process of absorbing. \nThe formal discipline approach seeks to develop causation between the advancement of the mind by exercising it through exposure to abstract school subjects such as science, language and mathematics. With student's repetitive exposure to these particular subjects, some scholars feel that the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to science, language and math is of \"secondary importance\", and believe that the strengthening and further development of the mind that this curriculum provides holds far greater significance to the progressing learner in the long haul. D.C. Phillips and Jonas F. Soltis provide some skepticism to this notion. Their skepticism stems largely in part from feeling that the relationship between formal discipline and the overall advancement of the mind is not as strong as some would say. They illustrate their skepticism by opining that it is foolish to blindly assume that people are better off in life, or at performing certain tasks, because of taking particular, yet unrelated courses.\n\nThe existence of multiple intelligences is proposed by psychologist Howard Gardner, who suggests that different kinds of intelligence exists in human beings. It is a theory that has been fashionable in continuous professional development (CPD) training courses for teachers. However, the theory of multiple intelligences is often cited as an example of pseudoscience because it lacks empirical evidence or falsifiability.\n\nMultimedia learning refers to the use of visual and auditory teaching materials that may include video, computer and other information technology. Multimedia learning theory focuses on the principles that determine the effective use of multimedia in learning, with emphasis on using both the visual and auditory channels for information processing.\n\nThe auditory channel deals with information that is heard, and the visual channel processes information that is seen. The visual channel holds less information than the auditory channel. If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.\n\nMany educators and researchers believe that information technology could bring innovation on traditional educational instructions. Teachers and technologists are searching for new and innovative ways to design learner-centered learning environments effectively, trying to engage learners more in the learning process. Claims have been made that online games have the potential to teach, train and educate and they are effective means for learning skills and attitudes that are not so easy to learn by rote memorization.\nThere has been a lot of research done in identifying the learning effectiveness in game based learning. Learner characteristics and cognitive learning outcomes have been identified as the key factors in research on the implementation of games in educational settings. In the process of learning a language through an online game, there is a strong relationship between the learner's prior knowledge of that language and their cognitive learning outcomes. For the people with prior knowledge of the language, the learning effectiveness of the games is much more than those with none or less knowledge of the language.\n\nOther learning theories have also been developed for more specific purposes. For example, andragogy is the art and science to help adults learn. Connectivism is a recent theory of networked learning, which focuses on learning as making connections. The Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. It starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).\n\nLearning style theories propose that individuals learn in different ways, that there are distinct learning styles and that knowledge of a learner's preferred learning style leads to faster and more satisfactory improvement. However, the current research has not been able to find solid scientific evidence to support the main premises of learning styles theory.\nPeople remember how things made them feel, and use those emotional imprints to create memories on demand.\n\nIn theories that make use of cognitive restructuring, an informal curriculum promotes the use of prior knowledge to help students gain a broad understanding of concepts. New knowledge cannot be told to students, it believes, but rather the students' current knowledge must be challenged. In this way, students adjust their ideas to more closely resemble actual theories or concepts. By using this method students gain the broad understanding they're taught and later are more willing to learn and keep the specifics of the concept or theory. This theory further aligns with the idea that teaching the concepts and the language of a subject should be split into multiple steps.\n\nOther informal learning theories look at the sources of motivation for learning. Intrinsic motivation may create a more self-regulated learner, yet schools undermine intrinsic motivation. Critics argue that the average student learning in isolation performs significantly less well than those learning with collaboration and mediation. Students learn through talk, discussion, and argumentation.\n\nAccording to Theodora Polito, \"every well-constructed theory of education [has] at [its] center a philosophical anthropology,\" which is \"a philosophical reflection on some basic problems of mankind.\" Philosophical anthropology is an exploration of human nature and humanity. Aristotle, an early influence on the field, deemed human nature to be \"rational animality,\" wherein humans are closely related to other animals but still set apart by their ability to form rational thought. Philosophical anthropology expanded upon these ideas by clarifying that rationality is, \"determined by the biological and social conditions in which the lives of human beings are embedded.\" Fully developed learning theories address some of the \"basic problems of mankind\" by examining these biological and social conditions to understand and manipulate the rationality of humanity in the context of learning.\n\nPhilosophical anthropology is evident in behaviorism, which requires an understanding of humanity and human nature in order to assert that the similarities between humans and other animals are critical and influential to the process of learning. Situated cognition focuses on how humans interact with each other and their environments, which would be considered the \"social conditions\" explored within the field of philosophical anthropology. Transformative learning theories operate with the assumption that humans are rational creatures capable of examining and redefining perspectives, something that is heavily considered within philosophical anthropology.\n\nAn awareness and understanding of philosophical anthropology contributes to a greater comprehension and practice of any learning theory. In some cases, philosophy can be used to further explore and define uncertain terms within the field of education. Philosophy can also be a vehicle to explore the purpose of education, which can greatly influence an educational theory.\n\nCritics of learning theories that seek to displace traditional educational practices claim that there is no need for such theories; that the attempt to comprehend the process of learning through the construction of theories creates problems and inhibits personal freedom.\n\nBULLET::::- Andragogical learning theory\nBULLET::::- Cognitivism (learning theory)\nBULLET::::- Connectivism (learning theory)\nBULLET::::- Constructivism (learning theory)\nBULLET::::- Cultural-historical psychology\nBULLET::::- Evidence-based education\nBULLET::::- Instructional theory\nBULLET::::- Instructional design\nBULLET::::- Kinesthetic learning\nBULLET::::- Learning by teaching\nBULLET::::- Learning environment\nBULLET::::- Learning space\nBULLET::::- Psychology of learning\nBULLET::::- Science, technology, society and environment education\n\nBULLET::::- About accelerating the learning process\nBULLET::::- Cognitive acceleration\nBULLET::::- Spaced repetition\nBULLET::::- Incremental reading\n\nBULLET::::- About the mechanisms of memory and learning\nBULLET::::- Neural networks in the brain\nBULLET::::- Sleep and learning\nBULLET::::- Latent learning\nBULLET::::- Memory consolidation\nBULLET::::- Short-term memory versus working memory\nBULLET::::- Long-term memory\nBULLET::::- Desirable difficulties\nBULLET::::- Declarative memory versus procedural memory\nBULLET::::- The cerebellum and motor learning\n\nBULLET::::- About learning theories related to classroom learning:\n\n45.

{"id": "17995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17995", "title": "Long-term memory", "text": "Long-term memory\n\nLong-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model where informative knowledge is held indefinitely. It is defined in contrast to short-term and working memory, which persist for only about 18 to 30 seconds. Long-term memory is commonly labelled as explicit memory (declarative), as well as episodic memory, semantic memory, autobiographical memory, and implicit memory (procedural memory).\n\nAccording to Miller, whose paper in 1956 popularized the theory of the \"magic number seven\", short-term memory is limited to a certain number of chunks of information, while long-term memory has a limitless store.\n\nAccording to the dual store memory model proposed by Richard C. Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968, memories can reside in the short-term \"buffer\" for a limited time while they are simultaneously strengthening their associations in long-term memory. When items are first presented, they enter short-term memory for approximately twenty to thirty seconds, but due to its limited space, as new items enter, older ones are pushed out. The limit of items that can be held in the short term memory is an average between four and seven, yet, with practice and new skills that number can be increased. However, each time an item in short-term memory is rehearsed, it is strengthened in long-term memory. Similarly, the longer an item stays in short-term memory, the stronger its association becomes in long-term memory.\n\nIn 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed an alternative theory of short-term memory: Baddeley's model of working memory. According to this theory, short-term memory is divided into different slave systems for different types of input items, and there is an executive control supervising what items enter and exit those systems. The slave systems include the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer (later added by Baddeley).\n\nLong-term memory encodes information semantically for storage, as researched by Baddeley. In vision, the information needs to enter working memory before it can be stored into long-term memory. This is evidenced by the fact that the speed with which information is stored into long-term memory is determined by the amount of information that can be fit, at each step, into visual working memory. In other words, the larger the capacity of working memory for certain stimuli, the faster will these materials be learned.\n\nSynaptic Consolidation is the process by which items are transferred from short-term to long-term memory. Within the first minutes or hours after acquisition, the engram (memory trace) is encoded within synapses, becoming resistant (though not immune) to interference from outside sources.\n\nAs long-term memory is subject to fading in the natural forgetting process, maintenance rehearsal (several recalls/retrievals of memory) may be needed to preserve long term memories. Individual retrievals can take place in increasing intervals in accordance with the principle of spaced repetition. This can happen quite naturally through reflection or deliberate recall (also known as recapitulation), often dependent on the perceived importance of the material. Using testing methods as a form of recall can lead to the testing effect, which aids long term memory through information retrieval and feedback.\n\nSome theories consider sleep to be an important factor in establishing well-organized long-term memories. \"(See also sleep and learning.)\" Sleep plays a key function in the consolidation of new memories.\n\nAccording to Tarnow's theory, long-term memories are stored in dream format (reminiscent of the Penfield & Rasmussen's findings that electrical excitations of the cortex give rise to experiences similar to dreams). During waking life an executive function interprets long-term memory consistent with reality checking . It is further proposed in the theory that the information stored in memory, no matter how it was learned, can affect performance on a particular task without the subject being aware that this memory is being used. Newly acquired declarative memory traces are believed to be reactivated during NonREM sleep to promote their hippocampo-neocortical transfer for long-term storage. Specifically, new declarative memories are better remembered if recall follows Stage II non-rapid eye movement sleep. The reactivation of memories during sleep can lead to lasting synaptic changes within certain neural networks. It is the high spindle activity, low oscillation activity, and delta wave activity during NREM sleep that helps to contribute to declarative memory consolidation. In learning before sleep spindles are redistributed to neuronally active upstates within slow oscillations. Sleep spindles are thought to induce synaptic changes and thereby contribute to memory consolidation during sleep. Here, we examined the role of sleep in the object-place recognition task, a task closely comparable to tasks typically applied for testing human declarative memory: It is a one-trial task, hippocampus-dependent, not stressful and can be repeated within the same animal. Sleep deprivation reduces vigilance or arousal levels, affecting the efficiency of certain cognitive functions such as learning and memory.\n\nThe theory that sleep benefits memory retention is not a new idea. It has been around since Ebbinghaus's experiment on forgetting in 1885. More recently studies have been done by Payne and colleagues and Holtz and colleagues. In Payne and colleague's experiment participants were randomly selected and split into two groups. Both groups were given semantically related or unrelated word pairs, but one group was given the information at 9 am and the other group received theirs at 9 pm. Participants were then tested on the word pairs at one of three intervals 30 minutes, 12 hours, or 24 hours later. It was found that participants who had a period of sleep between the learning and testing sessions did better on the memory tests. This information is similar to other results found by previous experiments by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924). It has also been found that many domains of declarative memory are affected by sleep such as emotional memory, semantic memory, and direct encoding.\n\nHoltz found that not only does sleep affect consolidation of declarative memories, but also procedural memories. In this experiment, fifty adolescent participants were taught either word pairs (which represents declarative memory) and a finger tapping task (procedural memory) at one of two different times of day. What they found was that the procedural finger tapping task was best encoded and remembered directly before sleep, but the declarative word pairs task was better remembered and encoded if learned at 3 in the afternoon.\n\nThe brain does not store memories in one unified structure, as might be seen in a computer's hard disk drive. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. Long-term memory is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.\n\nExplicit memory (or declarative memory) refers to all memories that are consciously available. These are encoded by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex, but consolidated and stored elsewhere. The precise location of storage is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research by Meulemans and Van der Linden (2003) found that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, these same amnesiac patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on implicit learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning.\n\nDeclarative memory has three major subdivisions:\n\nEpisodic memory refers to memory for specific events in time, as well as supporting their formation and retrieval. Some examples of episodic memory would be remembering someone's name and what happened at your last interaction with each other. Experiments conducted by Spaniol and colleagues indicated that older adults have worse episodic memories than younger adults because episodic memory requires context dependent memory.\n\nSemantic memory refers to knowledge about factual information, such as the meaning of words. Semantic memory is independent information such as information remembered for a test. In contrast with episodic memory, older adults and younger adults do not show much of a difference in semantic memory, presumably because semantic memory does not depend on context memory.\n\nAutobiographical memory refers to knowledge about events and personal experiences from an individual's own life. Though similar to episodic memory, it differs in that it contains only those experiences which directly pertain to the individual, from across their lifespan. Conway and Pleydell-Pearce (2000) argue that this is one component of the self-memory system.\n\nImplicit memory (procedural memory) refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. Research by Manelis, Hanson, and Hanson (2011) found that the reactivation of the parietal and occipital regions was associated with implicit memory. Procedural memory is considered non-declarative memory or unconscious memory which includes priming and non-associative learning.\nThe first part of nondeclarative memory (implicit memory) involves priming. Priming occurs when you do something faster after you have already done that activity, such as writing or using a fork.\nOther categories of memory may also be relevant to the discussion of long-term memory. For example:\n\nEmotional memory, the memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion, is a domain that can involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations, and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.\n\nWorking memory is not part of long-term memory, but is important for long-term memory to function. Working memory holds and manipulates information for a short period of time, before it is either forgotten or encoded into long-term memory. Then, in order to remember something from long-term memory, it must be brought back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded it can affect the encoding of long-term memory. If one has a good working memory they may have a better long-term memory encoding.\n\nMinor everyday slips and lapses of memory are fairly commonplace, and may increase naturally with age, when ill, or when under stress. Some women may experience more memory lapses following the onset of the menopause.\nIn general, more serious problems with memory occur due to traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe majority of findings on memory have been the result of studies that lesioned specific brain regions in rats or primates, but some of the most important work has been the result of accidental or inadvertent brain trauma. The most famous case in recent memory studies is the case study of HM, who had parts of his hippocampus, parahippocampal cortices, and surrounding tissue removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His subsequent total anterograde amnesia and partial retrograde amnesia provided the first evidence for the localization of memory function, and further clarified the differences between declarative and procedural memory.\n\nMany neurodegenerative diseases can cause memory loss. Some of the most prevalent (and, as a consequence, most intensely researched) include Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. None act specifically on memory; instead, memory loss is often a casualty of generalized neuronal deterioration. Currently, these illnesses are irreversible, but research into stem cells, psychopharmacology, and genetic engineering holds much promise.\n\nThose with Alzheimer's disease generally display symptoms such as getting momentarily lost on familiar routes, placing possessions in inappropriate locations and distortions of existing memories or completely forgetting memories. Researchers have often used the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (DRM) to study the effects of Alzheimer's disease on memory. The DRM paradigm presents a list of words such as doze, pillow, bed, dream, nap, etc., with a theme word that is not presented. In this case, the theme word would have been sleep. Alzheimer's disease patients are more likely to recall the theme word as being part of the original list than healthy adults. There is a possible link between longer encoding time and increased false memory in LTM. The patients end up relying on the gist of information instead of the specific words themselves. Alzheimer's leads to an uncontrolled inflammatory response brought on by extensive amyloid deposition in the brain, which leads to cell death in the brain. This gets worse over time and eventually leads to cognitive decline, after the loss of memory. Pioglitazone may improve cognitive impairments, including memory loss and may help protect long-term and visuospatial memory from neurodegenerative disease.\n\nParkinson's disease patients have problems with cognitive performance; these issues resemble what is seen in frontal lobe patients and can often lead to dementia. It is thought that Parkinson's disease is caused by degradation of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic projection originating from the ventral tegmental area. It has also been indicated that the hippocampus plays an important role in episodic and spatial (parts of LTM) memory and Parkinson's disease patients have abnormal hippocampuses resulting in abnormal functioning of LTM. L-dopa injections are often used to try to relieve Parkinson's disease symptoms as well as behavioral therapy.\n\nSchizophrenia patients have trouble with attention and executive functions which in turn affects long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. They cannot encode or retrieve temporal information properly, which causes them to select inappropriate social behaviors. They cannot effectively use the information they possess. The prefrontal cortex, where schizophrenia patients have structural abnormalities, is involved with the temporal lobe and also affects the hippocampus, which causes their difficulty in encoding and retrieving temporal information (including long-term memory).\n\nLong-term memory, unlike short-term memory, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins. This occurs within the cellular body, and concerns the particular transmitters, receptors, and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins. For more information, see long-term potentiation (LTP).\n\nOne of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining long-term memory. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC), known as PKMζ. PKMζ maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting PKMζ erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored.\n\nAlso, BDNF is important for the persistence of long-term memories.\n\nThe long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, dendritic spine and postsynaptic density.\nOn the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and HOMER1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.\n\nThe cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor which is believed to be important in consolidating short-term to long-term memories, and which is believed to be downregulated in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nRats exposed to an intense learning event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session. The long-term memory of such an event appears to be initially stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an exposure was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to hypomethylation. Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines in DNA. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including the enzyme Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event.\n\nA couple of studies have had results that contradict the dual-store memory model. Studies showed that in spite of using distractors, there was still both a recency effect for a list of items and a contiguity effect.\n\nAnother study revealed that how long an item spends in short-term memory is not the key determinant in its strength in long-term memory. Instead, whether the participant actively tries to remember the item while elaborating on its meaning determines the strength of its store in long-term memory.\n\nAn alternative theory is that there is only one memory store with associations among items and their contexts. In this model, the context serves as a cue for retrieval, and the recency effect is greatly caused by the factor of context. Immediate and delayed free-recall will have the same recency effect because the relative similarity of the contexts still exists. Also, the contiguity effect still occurs because contiguity also exists between similar contexts.\n\nBULLET::::- Emotion and memory\nBULLET::::- Intermediate-term memory\nBULLET::::- Memory and aging\nBULLET::::- Neurogenesis\n\n\nBULLET::::- The role of testing-effect in a long-term memory\n"}

{"id": "17997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17997", "title": "Latin declension", "text": "Latin declension\n\nLatin declension is the set of patterns according to which Latin words are declined, or have their endings altered to show grammatical case, number and gender. Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives are declined (verbs are conjugated), and a given pattern is called a declension. There are five declensions, which are numbered and grouped by ending and grammatical gender. Each noun follows one of the five declensions, but some irregular nouns have exceptions.\n\nAdjectives are of two kinds: those like 'good' use first-declension endings for the feminine, and second-declension for masculine and neuter. Other adjectives such as belong to the third declension. There are no fourth- or fifth-declension adjectives.\n\nPronouns are also of two kinds, the personal pronouns such as 'I' and 'you ()', which have their own irregular declension, and the third-person pronouns such as 'this' and 'that' which can generally be used either as pronouns or adjectivally. These latter decline in a similar way to the first and second noun declensions, but there are differences; for example the genitive singular ends in \"-īus\" or \"-ius\" instead of \"-ī\" or \"-ae\".\n\nThe cardinal numbers 'one', 'two', and 'three' also have their own declensions (\"ūnus\" has genitive \"-īus\" like a pronoun), and there are also numeral adjectives such as 'a pair, two each', which decline like ordinary adjectives.\n\nA complete Latin noun declension consists of up to seven grammatical cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and locative. However, the locative is limited to few nouns: generally names of cities, small islands and a few other words.\n\nThe case names are often abbreviated to the first three letters.\n\nIn Britain and countries influenced by Britain, the Latin cases are usually given in the order –––––(–). This order was first used in Benjamin Hall Kennedy's \"Latin Primer\" (1866), and it reflects the tendencies of different cases to share similar endings (see below).\n\nHowever, in American books the traditional order ––––– or its modification ––––– is found. The former is used in the well-known grammar of Gildersleeve and Lodge (1895) and was also formerly used in England, for example in \"The School and University Eton Latin Grammar\" (1861). The latter, with the vocative case at the end, is used in Allen and Greenough's \"New Latin Grammar\" (1903) and in Wheelock's Latin (first published in 1956).\n\nWhichever order is used in grammars, in dictionaries nouns are always cited using the nominative and genitive singular, for example \"king\". From the genitive ending (\"-ae, -ī, -is, -ūs, -ēī\") it can be discovered whether the noun is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th declension.\n\nFor further information about the various orders, see below.\n\nSyncretism, where one form in a paradigm shares the ending of another form in the paradigm, is common in Latin. The following are the most notable patterns of syncretism:\n\nBULLET::::- For pure Latin neuter nouns, the nominative singular, vocative singular, and accusative singular are identical; and the nominative plural, vocative plural, and accusative plural all end in \"-a\" (both of these features are inherited from Proto-Indo-European, and so are not true syncretism as the case endings were never attested as separate in the first place).\n\nBULLET::::- The vocative form is always the same as the nominative in the plural, and usually the same as the nominative in the singular except for second-declension masculine nouns ending in \"-us\" and a few nouns of Greek origin. For example, the vocative of the first-declension is .\nBULLET::::- The genitive singular is the same as the nominative plural in first-, second-, and fourth-declension masculine and feminine pure Latin nouns.\nBULLET::::- The dative singular is the same as the genitive singular in first- and fifth-declension pure Latin nouns.\nBULLET::::- The dative is always the same as the ablative in the singular in the second declension, the third-declension full \"i\"-stems (i.e. neuter \"i\"-stems, adjectives), and fourth-declension neuters.\nBULLET::::- The dative, ablative, and locative are always identical in the plural.\nBULLET::::- The locative is identical to the ablative in the fourth and fifth declensions.\n\nOld Latin had essentially two patterns of endings. One pattern was shared by the first and second declensions, which derived from the Proto-Indo-European thematic declension. The other pattern was used by the third, fourth and fifth declensions, and derived from the athematic PIE declension.\n\nThere are two principal parts for Latin nouns: the nominative singular and the genitive singular. Each declension can be unequivocally identified by the ending of the genitive singular (-\"ae\", -\"i\", -\"is\", -\"ūs\", -\"ei\"). The stem of the noun can be identified by the form of the genitive singular as well.\n\nThere are five declensions for Latin nouns:\n\nNouns of this declension usually end in \"-a\" in the nominative singular and are mostly feminine, e.g. ('road') and ('water'). There is a small class of masculine exceptions generally referring to occupations, e.g. ('poet'), ('farmer') and ('sailor').\n\nThe predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is \"a\". The nominative singular form consists of the stem and the ending \"-a\", and the genitive singular form is the stem plus \"-ae\".\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" \n! colspan=\"2\"  First declension paradigm\n!

Nominative\n! Accusative\n! Genitive\n! Dative\n! Ablative\n\nThe locative endings for the first declension are \"-ae\" (singular) and \"-īs\" (plural), similar to the genitive singular and ablative plural, as in ' 'in war' and ' 'at Athens'.\n\nThe first declension also includes three types of Greek loanwords, derived from Ancient Greek's Alpha Declension. They are declined irregularly in the singular, but sometimes treated as native Latin nouns, e.g. nominative ('athlete') instead of the original \"athlētēs. Archaic (Homeric) first declension Greek nouns and adjectives had been formed in exactly the same way as in Latin: \"nephelēgeréta Zeus\" ('Zeus the cloud-gatherer') had in classical Greek become \"nephelēgerétēs.\n\nFor full paradigm tables and more detailed information, see the Wiktionary appendix First declension.\n\nThe second declension is a large group of nouns consisting of mostly masculine nouns like ('horse') and ('boy') and neuter nouns like ('fort'). There are several small groups of feminine exceptions, including names of gemstones, plants, trees, and some towns and cities.\n\nIn the nominative singular, most masculine nouns consist of the stem and the ending \"-us\", although some end in \"-er\", which is not necessarily attached to the complete stem. Neuter nouns generally have a nominative singular consisting of the stem and the ending \"-um\". However, every second-declension noun has the ending \"-ī\" attached as a suffix to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form. The predominant letter in the ending forms of this declension is \"o\".\n\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"4\"  Second declension paradigm\n! colspan=\"2\"  Singular  colspan=\"2\"  Plural\n!

Ablative\n\nThe locative endings for the second declension are \"-ī\" (singular) and \"-īs\" (plural); \"at Corinth\", \"at Milan\", and \"at Philippi\".\n\nNouns ending in \"-ius\" and \"-ium\" have a genitive singular in \"-ī\" in earlier Latin, which was regularized to \"-iī\" in the later language. Masculine nouns in \"-ius\" have a vocative singular in \"-ī\" at all stages. These forms in \"-ī\" are stressed on the same syllable as the nominative singular, sometimes in violation of the usual Latin stress rule. For example, the genitive and vocative singular \"Vergilī\" (from ) is pronounced \"Vergílī\", with stress on the penult, even though it is short. In Old Latin, however, the vocative was declined regularly, using \"-ie\" instead, e.g. \"fīlie\" \"[Oh] son\", archaic vocative of \"fīlius\".\n\nThere is no contraction of \"-iī(s)\" in plural forms and in the locative.\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" \n! colspan=\"2\"  son \n! colspan=\"2\"  aid, help \n! Singular\n! Plural\n! Singular\n! Plural\n! Nominative\n! Vocative\n! Accusative\n! Genitive\n! Dative\n! Ablative\n\nIn the older language, nouns ending with \"-vus\", \"-quus\" and \"-vum\" take \"o\" rather than \"u\" in the nominative and accusative singular. For example, ('slave') could be \"servos\", accusative \"servom\".\n\nSome masculine nouns of the second declension end in \"-er\" or \"-ir\" in the nominative singular. For such nouns, the genitive singular must be learned to see if the \"e\" is dropped. For example, ('father-in-law') keeps its \"e\". However, the noun ('teacher') drops its \"e\" in the genitive singular. Nouns with \"-ir\" in the nominative singular, such as , never drop the \"i\".\n\nThe declension of second-declension \"-r\" nouns is identical to that of the regular second declension, except that the vocative suffix \"-e\" is optional.\n\nFor declension tables of second-declension nouns, see the .\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" \n! colspan=\"2\"  boy \n! colspan=\"2\"  field \n! colspan=\"2\"  man \n!

These nouns are irregular only in the singular, as are their first-declension counterparts. Greek nouns in the second declension are derived from the Omicron declension.\n\nSome Greek nouns may also be declined as normal Latin nouns. For example, can appear as \"theātrum\".\n\nThe inflection of ('god') is irregular. The vocative singular of \"deus\" is not attested in Classical Latin. In Ecclesiastical Latin the vocative of \"Deus\" ('God') is \"Deus\".\n\nIn poetry, \"-um\" may substitute \"-ōrum\" as the genitive plural ending.\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" \n! colspan=\"2\"  \"deus, deī\"god \n! Singular\n! Plural\n! Nominative\n! Accusative\n! Genitive\n! Dative\n! Ablative\n\nThe Latin word \"vīrus\" (the \"ī\" indicates a long \"i\") means \"1. slimy liquid, slime; 2. poison, venom\", denoting the venom of a snake. This Latin word is probably related to the Greek (\"ios\") meaning \"venom\" or \"rust\" and the Sanskrit word \"\" meaning \"toxic, poison\".\n\nSince \"vīrus\" in antiquity denoted something uncountable, it was a mass noun. Mass nouns pluralize only under special circumstances, hence the non-existence of plural forms in the texts.\n\nIn Neo-Latin, a plural form is necessary in order to express the modern concept of ‘viruses’, which leads to the following declension:\n\n! rowspan=\"2\" \n! colspan=\"2\"  \"\"poison, venom, virus \n! Singular\n! Plural\n! Nominative\n! Accusative\n! Genitive\n! Dative\n! Ablative\nThe third declension is the largest group of nouns. The nominative singular of these nouns may end in \"-a\", \"-e\", \"-ī\", \"-ō\", \"-y\", \"-c\", \"-l\", \"-n\", \"-r\", \"-s\", \"-t\", or \"-x\". This group of nouns includes masculine, neuter, and feminine nouns.\n\nThe stem of a consonant-stem noun may be found from the genitive case by removing the ending \"-is\". For example, the stem of 'peace' is \"pāc-\".\n\nExamples are 'river', 'flower', and 'peace'. \n\nMasculine, feminine and neuter nouns often have their own special nominative singular endings. For instance, many masculine nouns end in \"-or\" (, 'love'). Many feminine nouns end in \"-īx\" (, 'phoenix'), and many neuter nouns end in \"-us\" with an \"r\" stem in the oblique cases ( 'burden'; 'time').\n\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"4\"  Third declension paradigm(consonant stems)\n! colspan=\"2\"  Masculine &feminine  colspan=\"2\"  Neuter\n!

They are called \"i\"-stems. \"i\"-stems are broken into two subcategories: pure and mixed. Pure \"i\"-stems are indicated by special neuter endings. Mixed \"i\"-stems are indicated by the double consonant rule. Stems indicated by the parisyllabic rule are usually mixed, occasionally pure.\nBULLET::::- Masculine and feminine\nBULLET::::- Neuter\n\nThe mixed declension is distinguished from the consonant type only by having \"-ium\" in the genitive plural (and occasionally \"-īs\" in the accusative plural). The pure declension is characterized by having \"-ī\" in the ablative singular, \"-ium\" in the genitive plural, \"-ia\" in the nominative and accusative plural neuter, and \"-im\" in the accusative singular masculine and feminine (however, adjectives have \"-em\").\n\nThe accusative plural ending \"-īs\" is found in early Latin up to Virgil, but from the early empire onwards it was replaced by \"-ēs\".\n\nThe accusative singular ending \"-im\" is found only in a few words: always in 'cough', 'thirst', 'River Tiber'; usually in 'axe', 'tower'; occasionally in 'ship'. Most nouns, however, have accusative singular \"-em\".\n\nThe ablative singular \"-ī\" is found in nouns which have \"-im\", and also, optionally, in some other nouns, e.g. or 'in the fire'.\n\nThere are two mixed-declension neuter nouns: ('heart') and ('bone'). Also, the mixed declension is used in the plural-only adjective ('most').\n\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"5\"  Third declension paradigm(\"i\"-stem nouns)\n! colspan=\"2\"  Masculine &Feminine  colspan=\"2\"  Neuter\n!

Likewise, ('father'), ('mother'), ('brother'), and ('parent') violate the double-consonant rule. This fluidity even in Roman times resulted in much more uncertainty in Medieval Latin.\n\nSome nouns in \"-tāt-\", such as 'city, community' can have either consonant-stem or \"i\"-stem genitive plural: or 'of the cities'.\n\nIn the third declension, there are four irregular nouns.\n!rowspan=\"2\"  Case\n! colspan=\"2\"  force, power \n! colspan=\"2\"  swine, pig, hog \n! colspan=\"2\"  ox, bullock \n!

The fourth declension also includes several neuter nouns including ('knee'). Each noun has the ending \"-ūs\" as a suffix attached to the root of the noun in the genitive singular form.

To express possession, the possessive pronouns (essentially adjectives) , , , are used, declined in the first and second declensions to agree in number and case with the thing possessed, e.g. \"pater meus\" 'my father', \"māter mea\" 'my mother'.

Ablative\n\nUsually, to show the ablative of accompaniment, would be added to the ablative form. However, with personal pronouns (first and second person), the reflexive and the interrogative, \"-cum\" is added onto the end of the ablative form. That is: 'with me', 'with us', 'with you', , and (sometimes ).\n\nPronouns have also an emphatic form bi using the suffix \"-met\" (, /, , ), used in all cases, except by the genitive plural forms.\n\nIn accusative case, the forms \"mēmē\" and \"tētē\" exist as emphatic, but they are not widely used.\n\nWhen 'his' or 'her' refers to someone else, not the subject, the genitive pronoun \"eius\" (as well as \"eōrum\" and \"eārum\") 'of him' is used instead of \"suus\":\n\nWhen one sentence is embedded inside another with a different subject, \"sē\" and \"suus\" can refer to either subject:\n\nFor the third-person pronoun 'he', see below.\n\nRelative, demonstrative and indefinite pronouns are generally declined like first and second declension adjectives, with the following differences:\nBULLET::::- the nominatives are often irregular\nBULLET::::- the genitive singular ends in \"-īus\" rather than \"-ae\" or \"-ī\".\nBULLET::::- the dative singular ends in \"-ī\": rather than \"-ae\" or \"-ō\".\n\nThese differences characterize the pronominal declension, and a few special adjectives ( 'whole', 'alone', 'one', 'no', 'another', 'another [of two]', etc.) are also declined according to this pattern.\n\nAll demonstrative, relative, and indefinite pronouns in Latin can also be used adjectivally, with some small differences; for example in the interrogative pronoun, 'who?' and 'what?' are usually used for the pronominal form, and 'which?' for the adjectival form.\n\nThe weak demonstrative pronoun , , 'that' also serves as the third person pronoun 'he, she, it':\n\n! rowspan=\"5\"  \n! colspan=\"8\"  Third person\n! colspan=\"6\"  he, she, it\n! colspan=\"3\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"3\"  Plural\n!

It has no possessive adjective; the genitive is used instead: \"pater eius\" 'his/her father'; \"pater eōrum\" 'their father'.\n\nThe pronoun or pronominal adjective means 'the same'. It is derived from \"is\" with the suffix \"-dem\".

Some adjectives, however, like the one-ending ('old, aged'), have \"-e\" in the ablative singular, \"-um\" in the genitive plural, and \"-a\" in the nominative and accusative neuter plural.\n\nThese have a single nominative ending for all genders, although as usual the endings for the other cases vary. As with nouns, a genitive is given for the purpose of showing the inflection.\n\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"4\"  terrible, mean, cruel\n! colspan=\"2\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"2\"  Plural\n!

The ending for the masculine and feminine is \"-is\", and the ending for the neuter is \"-e\". It is not necessary to give the genitive, as it is the same as the nominative masculine singular.\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"4\"  nimble, swift\n! colspan=\"2\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"2\"  Plural\n!

The feminine ends in \"-ris\", and the neuter ends in \"-re\". The genitive is the same as the nominative feminine singular.\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"6\"  swift, rapid, brash\n! colspan=\"3\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"3\"  Plural\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n!

For regular first and second declension and third declension adjectives with one or two endings, the comparative is formed by adding \"-ior\" for the masculine and feminine, and \"-ius\" for the neuter to the stem. The genitives for both are formed by adding \"-iōris\". Therefore, they are declined in the third declension, but they are not declined as \"i\"-stems. Superlatives are formed by adding \"-issimus, -issima, -issimum\" to the stem and are thus declined like first and second declension adjectives.\n\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"4\"  higher, deeper (comparative of )\n! colspan=\"2\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"2\"  Plural\n!

As with normal adjectives, the comparative is formed by adding \"-ior\" to the stem, but for the superlative, \"-rimus\" is added to the nominative masculine singular.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\" style=\"text-align: center\" rowspan=\"7\"AdjectivePositivebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Comparativebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Superlative\n\nSome third declension adjectives with two endings in \"-lis\" in the masculine–feminine nominative singular have irregular superlative forms.

Instead, ('more') and ('most'), the comparative and superlative degrees of ('much, greatly'), respectively, are used.\n\nMany adjectives in \"-uus\", except those in \"-quus\" or \"-guus\", also follow this rule.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\" style=\"text-align: center\" rowspan=\"8\"AdjectivePositivebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Comparativebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Superlative\n\nAs in most languages, Latin has adjectives that have irregular comparatives and superlatives.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\" style=\"text-align: center\" rowspan=\"15\"AdjectivePositivebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Comparativebgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Superlative\n\nThere are several different kinds of numeral words in Latin: the two most common are cardinal numerals and ordinal numerals. There are also several more rare numerals, e.g., distributive numerals and adverbial numerals.\n\nAll cardinal numerals are indeclinable, except ('one'), ('two'), ('three'), plural hundreds ('two hundred'), ('three hundred') etc., and ('thousand'), which have cases and genders like adjectives. is declined like a first- and second-declension pronoun with \"-īus\" in the genitive, and \"-ī\" in the dative. is declined irregularly, is declined like a third-declension plural adjective, \"-centī\" ('hundred') numerals decline like first- and second-declension adjectives, and is invariable in the singular and declined like a third-declension \"i\"-stem neuter noun in the plural:\n\nThe existence of plural endings for \"ūnus\" might seem unnecessary; however, they are used with \"pluralia tantum\" nouns, e. g. \"ūna castra\" (one [military] camp), \"ūnae scālae\" (one ladder).\n! rowspan=\"3\" \n! colspan=\"6\"  one\n! colspan=\"3\"  Singular\n! colspan=\"3\"  Plural\n!

However, its plural, \"mīlia\", is a plural third-declension \"i\"-stem neuter noun.

However, adverbs must be formed if one wants to make an adjective into an adverb.\n\nFirst and second declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding \"-ē\" onto their stems.\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Adjectivecolspan=\"2\"Adverb\n\nTypically, third declension adjectives' adverbs are formed by adding \"-iter\" to the stem. However, most third declension adjectives with one ending simply add \"-er\" to the stem.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"Adjectivecolspan=\"2\"Adverb\n\nAdverbs' comparative forms are identical to the nominative neuter singular of the corresponding comparative adjective. Adverbs' superlative forms are simply formed by attaching the regular ending \"-ē\" to the corresponding superlative adjective. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, first and second declensions adjectives ending in \"-eus\" or \"-ius\" use and as opposed to distinct endings.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"PositiveComparativeSuperlative\n\nAs with adjectives, there are irregular adverbs with peculiar comparative and superlative forms.\n\n!bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\"PositiveComparativeSuperlative\n— ('before, previously') ('first')\n\nSome nouns are only used in the singular (singulare tantum) such as:\nBULLET::::- materials, such as 'gold'\nSome nouns are only used in the plural (plurale tantum), or when plural have a singular meaning such as:\nBULLET::::- many festivals, such as 'Saturnalia'\nBULLET::::- 'camp' and 'arms'; 'a letter' (cf. 'letter of the alphabet')\nBULLET::::- a few geographical names are plural such as 'Thebes' (both the Greek and the Egyptian cities)\n\nIndeclinable nouns are nouns which only have one form in all cases (of the singular).\nBULLET::::- ('fate, divine law')\nBULLET::::- ('likeness')\nBULLET::::- ('morning')\nBULLET::::- ('sin, abomination')\nBULLET::::- , ('nothing, none')\nBULLET::::- ('sex')\n\nHeterogeneous nouns are nouns which vary in respect to gender.\n\nBULLET::::- A few nouns in the second declension occur in both the neuter and masculine. However, their meanings remain the same.\nBULLET::::- Some nouns are one gender in the singular, but become another gender in the plural. They may also change in meaning.\n\n! Singular !! Plural\n\n! Singular !! Plural\n\nIn modern textbooks of Latin, there is no single international standard for the sequence of cases.\nThis order reflects the syncretic trends of different cases to share similar endings. Usually the vocative and locative cases are omitted because they appear in the paradigm of only a few word classes and are dealt with separately. This makes the paradigm appear normally in the format ––––, which is also roughly the order of how frequently the cases appear in Latin text, meaning that the cases are introduced in teaching in this order. This paradigm has been the usual order in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries since the publication of Benjamin Hall Kennedy's \"Latin Primer\" (1866). It is the only method nowadays used in Hungary. It is also usual in France and Belgium.\nThis alternative sequence arose from Byzantine grammarians who were originally writing about Greek. It is standard in the United States, although modern texts increasingly move the vocative at the end to minimize disruption to the declensions in which it is identical to the nominative; some introductory texts such as \"Wheelock's Latin\" almost entirely ignore the vocative and locative except for a few brief notes, giving the format –––––(). This paradigm is also used in Poland, as it closely corresponds to the conventional case order in the Polish language, except for the latter's use of an instrumental case instead of an ablative. The same sequence is predominant in the Netherlands, although the modern Dutch language has largely lost its case system; instead, the rationale is that this general order is convenient for the consistent teaching of three different commonly studied declensional languages: Latin, Ancient Greek, and modern German. The order ––––()– is also used in Germany itself to echo the conventional order of German cases (–––), and also in Lithuania because the conventional order of Lithuanian noun cases is the same. The locative is dealt with separately as it is seldom used in Latin and might be considered to be on the verge of extinction in Classical Latin.\n\nThe order ––––– is the standard order used in Greece (both for the teaching of Ancient and Modern Greek as well as Latin) and Italy (with the vocative case before the ablative). Here again, the locative is dealt with separately.\n\nBrazilian grammarian Napoleão Mendes used the unusual sequence –––––. The Latinum podcast uses –––––, as this facilitates memorisation. Latinum deals with the locative separately.\n\nBULLET::::- Declension of Greek nouns in Latin\nBULLET::::- Latin conjugation\nBULLET::::- Latin mnemonics\nBULLET::::- William Whitaker's Words\nBULLET::::- Greek declension\n\nBULLET::::- \"Rosa\" (1962), a song by the Belgian singer Jacques Brel, with the declension of following the British order of cases.\n\nBULLET::::- Latin declensor\nBULLET::::- New Latin Grammar, an eBook, originally written by Charles Edwin Bennett, at the Project Gutenberg\nBULLET::::- Interactive Latin Word Endings\nBULLET::::- A Student's Latin Grammar, by Cambridge Latin Course's Robin Griffin, Third Edition\n"}

{"id": "17999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17999", "title": "Latin spelling and pronunciation", "text": "Latin spelling and pronunciation\n\nLatin spelling, or Latin orthography, is the spelling of Latin words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin from Old Latin to the present. All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase. The Roman alphabet, or Latin alphabet, was adapted from the Old Italic script to represent the phonemes of the Latin language. The Old Italic script had in turn been borrowed from the Greek alphabet, itself adapted from the Phoenician alphabet. The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet around 540 BC, as it appears on the black-figure pottery of the time.\n\nLatin pronunciation continually evolved over the centuries, making it difficult for speakers in one era to know how Latin was spoken in prior eras. A given phoneme may be represented by different letters in different periods. This article deals primarily with modern scholarship's best reconstruction of Classical Latin's phonemes (phonology) and the pronunciation and spelling used by educated people in the late Republic. This article then touches upon later changes and other variants. Knowledge of how Latin was pronounced comes from Roman grammar books, common misspellings by Romans, transcriptions into other ancient languages, and from how pronunciation has evolved in derived Romance languages.\n\nThe forms of the Latin alphabet used during the Classical period did not distinguish between upper case and lower case. Roman inscriptions typically use Roman square capitals, which resemble modern capitals, and handwritten text often uses old Roman cursive, which includes letterforms similar to modern lowercase.\n\nThis article uses small caps for Latin text, representing Roman square capitals, and long vowels are marked with acutes, representing apices. In the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\nIn ancient Latin spelling, individual letters mostly corresponded to individual phonemes, with three main exceptions:\nBULLET::::1. The vowel letters \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", \"y\" represented both short and long vowels. The long vowels were often marked by apices during the Classical period ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩, and long i was written using a taller version ⟨I⟩, called i longa \"long I\": ⟨ꟾ⟩; but now long vowels are sometimes written with a macron in modern editions (\"ā\"), while short vowels are marked with a breve (\"ă\") in dictionaries when necessary.\nBULLET::::2. Some pairs of vowel letters, such as \"ae\", represented either a diphthong in one syllable or two vowels in adjacent syllables.\nBULLET::::3. The letters \"i\" and \"u - v\" represented either the close vowels and or the semivowels and .\n\nIn the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes that they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\nThis is a table of the consonant sounds of Classical Latin. Sounds in parentheses are allophones, sounds with an asterisk exist mainly in loanwords and sounds with a dagger (†) are phonemes only in some analyses.\n\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" \n! rowspan=\"2\"  Labial\n! rowspan=\"2\"  Dental\n! rowspan=\"2\"  Palatal\n! colspan=\"2\"  Velar\n! rowspan=\"2\"  Glottal\n! \n\n! rowspan=\"3\"  Plosive\n\n! rowspan=\"2\"  Fricative\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  Nasal\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  Rhotic\n\n! colspan=\"2\"  Approximant\n\nBULLET::::- The labialized velar stops and may both have been single phonemes rather than clusters like the and in English \"quick\" and \"penguin\". is more likely to have been a phoneme than . occurs between vowels and counts as a single consonant in Classical Latin poetry, but occurs only after , where it cannot be identified as a single or double consonant. and were palatalized before a front vowel, becoming and , as in \"quī\" compared with \"quod\" , and \"lingua\" compared with \"pinguis\" . This sound change did not apply to in the same position: \"uī - vī\" .\nBULLET::::- before may have become by dissimilation. This is suggested by the fact that \"equus\" and \"unguunt\" (Old Latin equos and unguont) are spelled \"ecus\" and \"ungunt\", which may have indicated the pronunciations and . These spellings may, however, simply indicate that \"c g\" before \"u\" were labialized like , so that writing a double \"uu\" was redundant.\nBULLET::::- The voiceless plosives in Latin were likely less aspirated than voiceless plosives at the beginning of words in English; for example, Latin was not as strongly aspirated as \"k\" in \"kind\" but more like \"k\" in English \"sky\" or \"look\". However, there was no phonemic contrast between voiceless and aspirated plosives in native Latin words, and the voiceless plosives were probably somewhat aspirated at the beginnings of words and near and . Some Greek words beginning with the voiceless plosives , when they were borrowed into colloquial Latin, were spelled with the graphemes used to represent voiced plosives \"b d g\" , e.g., Latin \"gubernator\" besides West Greek (helmsman). That suggests that Latin speakers felt the Greek voiceless plosives to sound less aspirated than their own native equivalents.\nBULLET::::- The aspirated consonants as distinctive phonemes were originally foreign to Latin, appearing in educated loanwords and names from Greek. In such cases, the aspiration was likely produced only by educated speakers.\nBULLET::::- was also not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC, when it was probably pronounced initially and doubled between vowels, in contrast to Classical Greek or . In Classical Latin poetry, the letter between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.\nBULLET::::- In Classical Latin, the coronal sibilant was likely unvoiced in all positions. In Old Latin, single between vowels was pronounced as voiced but had changed to by rhotacism by the time of Classical Latin, as in \"gerō\" as compared with \"gestus\" . Single intervocalic in Classical Latin usually derives from an earlier double after a long vowel or diphthong, as in \"causa\", \"cāsus\" from earlier \"caussa\", \"cāssus\"; or is found in loanwords, such as \"pausa\" from Greek (\"pausis\").\nBULLET::::- In Old Latin, final after a short vowel was often lost, probably after first changing to (debuccalization), as in the inscriptional form \"Cornelio\" for \"Cornelios\" (Classical Latin \"Cornelius\"). Often in the poetry of Plautus, Ennius, and Lucretius, final before a word beginning in a consonant did not make the preceding syllable heavy.\nBULLET::::- was labiodental in Classical Latin, but it may have been bilabial in Old Latin, or perhaps in free variation with . Lloyd, Sturtevant, and Kent make this argument based on certain misspellings in inscriptions, the Proto-Indo-European phoneme from which many instances of the Latin \"f\" descended (others are from and ) and the way the sound appears to have behaved in Vulgar Latin, particularly in Spain.\nBULLET::::- In most cases was pronounced as a bilabial nasal. At the end of a word, however, it was generally lost beginning in Old Latin (except when another nasal or a plosive followed it), causing the preceding vowel to be lengthened and nasalized, as in \"decem\" . In Old Latin inscriptions, it is often omitted, as in \"viro\" for \"virom\" (Classical \"virum\"). It was frequently elided before a following vowel in Latin poetry, and it was lost without a trace (apart from the lengthening) in the Romance languages, except in monosyllabic words.\nBULLET::::- assimilated to before labial consonants as in \"impar\" < *in-par, to before (if it did not represent nasalization) and to before velar consonants, as in \"quīnque\" . This assimilation likely also occurred between the preposition \"in\" and a following word: \"in causā\" , \"in pace\" .\nBULLET::::- assimilated to a velar nasal before . Allen and Greenough say that a vowel before is always long, but W. Sidney Allen says that is based on an interpolation in Priscian, and the vowel was actually long or short depending on the root, as for example \"rēgnum\" from the root of \"rēx\" , but \"magnus\" from the root of \"magis\" . probably did not assimilate to before . The cluster arose by syncope, as for example \"tegmen\" from \"tegimen\". Original developed into in \"flamma\", from the root of \"flagrō\". At the start of a word, was reduced to , and this change was reflected in the orthography in later texts: \"gnātus\" became \"nātus\", \"gnōscō\" became \"nōscō\".\nBULLET::::- In Classical Latin, the rhotic was most likely an alveolar trill . Gaius Lucilius likens it to the sound of a dog, and later writers describe it as being produced by vibration. In Old Latin, intervocalic developed into (rhotacism), suggesting an approximant like the English , and was sometimes written as , suggesting a tap like Spanish single \"r\".\nBULLET::::- had two allophones in Latin: and . Roman grammarians called these variants \"exīlis\" ('thin') and \"plēnus\" or \"pinguis\" ('full' or 'thick'). Those adjectives are used elsewhere for front and back vowels respectively, which suggests that the \"thin\" allophone was a plain alveolar lateral approximant , like the clear in English \"leaf\" in some English dialects or that of languages like Spanish or German, while the \"full\" or \"thick\" allophone was velarized like the English dark in \"full\". It is partly uncertain where these allophones occurred. Sihler and Allen agree that was clear when the sound was doubled as , and dark when it occurred before another consonant or at the end of a word, but disagree on whether clear or dark \"l\" occurred before vowels. Sihler says that was clear before and dark before other vowels, but Allen says that was dark before back vowels in pre-Classical Latin and clear before both front and back vowels in Classical Latin. This represents a partial agreement, however, in that Sihler argues the Classical Latin had three degrees of velarization, with a darker enunciation before consonants than vowels.\nBULLET::::- generally appeared only at the beginning of words, before a vowel, as in \"iaceō\" , except in compound words such as \"adiaceō\" . Between vowels, this sound was generally not found as a single consonant, only as doubled , as in \"cuius\" , except in compound words such as \"trāiectus\" . varied with in the same morpheme in \"iam\" and \"etiam\" , and in poetry, one could be replaced with the other for the purposes of meter.\nBULLET::::- was pronounced as an approximant until the first century AD, when and began to develop into fricatives. In poetry, and could be replaced with each other, as in for \"silva\" and for \"genua\" . Unlike , it was not doubled as or between vowels, except in Greek loanwords: \"cavē\" , but \"Evander\" from .\n\nBULLET::::- Doubled consonant letters, such as \"cc\", \"ss\", represented geminated (doubled or long) consonants: . In Old Latin, geminate consonants were written singly like single consonants, until the middle of the 2nd century BC, when they began to be doubled in writing. Grammarians mention the marking of double consonants with the sicilicus, a diacritic in the shape of a sickle. This mark appears in a few inscriptions of the Augustan era.\nBULLET::::- \"c\" and \"k\" both represent the velar stop ; \"qu\" represents the labialized velar stop . The letters \"q\" and \"c\" distinguish minimal pairs between and , such as \"cui\" and \"quī\" . In Classical Latin, \"k\" appeared in only a few words, such as \"kalendae\" or \"Karthagō\" (but can also be spelled \"calendae\" and \"Carthagō\" respectively).\nBULLET::::- \"x\" represented the consonant cluster . In Old Latin, this sequence was also spelled as \"ks\", \"cs\", and \"xs\". X was borrowed from the Western Greek alphabet, in which the letterform of chi Χ was pronounced as . In the standard Ionic alphabet, used for modern editions of Ancient Greek, on the other hand, Χ represented , and the letter xi Ξ represented .\nBULLET::::- In Old Latin inscriptions, and were not distinguished. They were both represented by \"c\" before \"e\" and \"i\", \"q\" before \"o\" and \"u\", and \"k\" before consonants and \"a\". The letterform of \"c\" derives from Greek gamma Γ, which represented , but its use for may come from Etruscan, which did not distinguish voiced and voiceless plosives. In Classical Latin, \"c\" represented only in \"c\" and \"cn\", the abbreviations of the praenomina (first names) \"Gaius\" and \"Gnaeus\".\nBULLET::::- The letter \"g\" was created in the third century BC to distinguish the voiced from voiceless . Its letterform derived from \"c\" by the addition of a diacritic or stroke. Plutarch attributes this innovation to Spurius Carvilius Ruga around 230 BC, but it may have originated with Appius Claudius Caecus in the fourth century BC.\nBULLET::::- The combination \"gn\" probably represented the consonant cluster , at least between vowels, as in \"agnus\" . Vowels before this cluster were sometimes long and sometimes short.\nBULLET::::- The digraphs \"ph\", \"th,\" and \"ch\" represented the aspirated plosives , and . They began to be used in writing around 150 BC, primarily as a transcription of Greek phi , theta , and chi , as in \"Philippus\", \"cithara\", and \"achāia\". Some native words were later also written with these digraphs, such as \"pulcher\", \"lachrima\", \"gracchus\", \"triumphus\", probably representing aspirated allophones of the voiceless plosives near and . Aspirated plosives and the glottal fricative were also used hypercorrectively, an affectation satirized in .\nBULLET::::- In Old Latin, Koine Greek initial and between vowels were represented by \"s\" and \"ss\", as in \"sona\" from and \"massa\" from . Around the second and first centuries B.C., the Greek letter zeta Ζ was adopted to represent and . However, the Vulgar Latin spellings \"z\" or \"zi\" for earlier \"di\" and \"d\" before \"e\", and the spellings \"di\" and \"dz\" for earlier \"z\", suggest the pronunciation , as for example \"ziomedis\" for \"diomedis\", and \"diaeta\" for \"zeta\".\nBULLET::::- In ancient times \"u\" and \"i\" represented the approximant consonants and , as well as the close vowels and .\nBULLET::::- \"i\" representing the consonant was usually not doubled in writing so a single \"i\" represented double or and the sequences and , as in \"cuius\" for *\"cuiius\" , \"conicit\" for *\"coniicit\" , and \"rēicit\" for *\"reiiicit\" . Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of \"i\" could occur in some of the same environments: compare \"māius\" with \"Gāius\" , and \"Iūlius\" with \"Iūlus\" . The vowel before a doubled is sometimes marked with a macron, as in \"cūius\". It indicates not that the vowel is long but that the first syllable is heavy from the double consonant.\nBULLET::::- \"v\" between vowels represented single in native Latin words but double in Greek loanwords. Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of \"v\" sometimes occurred in similar environments, as in \"genua\" and \"silva\" .\n\nLatin has ten native vowels, spelled \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\". In Classical Latin, each vowel had short and long versions: and . The long versions of the close and mid vowels \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\" had a different vowel quality from the short versions, so that long were similar to short . Some loanwords from Greek had the vowel \"y\", which was pronounced as by educated speakers but approximated with the native vowels \"u\" and \"i\" by less educated speakers.\n\n! rowspan=\"2\"  \n! colspan=\"2\"  Front\n! colspan=\"2\"  Central\n! colspan=\"2\"  Back\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n!

Open\n\nEach vowel letter (with the possible exception of \"y\") represents at least two phonemes. \"a\" can represent either short or long , \"e\" represents either or , etc.\n\nShort mid vowels () and close vowels () were pronounced with a different quality from their long counterparts, being also more open: , , and . This opening made the short vowels \"i u\" similar in quality to long \"é ó\" respectively. \"i é\" and \"u ó\" were often written in place of each other in inscriptions:\nBULLET::::- \"trebibos\" for \"tribibus\"\nBULLET::::- \"minsis\" for \"mensis\"\nBULLET::::- \"sob\" for \"sub\"\nBULLET::::- \"punere\" for \"pōnere\"\n\nShort most likely had a more open allophone before and tended toward near-open .\n\nShort and were probably pronounced closer when they occurred before another vowel. \"mea\" was written as \"mia\" in inscriptions. Short before another vowel is often written with \"i longa\", as in \"dīes\", indicating that its quality was similar to that of long and is almost never confused with \"e\" in this position.\n\n\"y\" was used in Greek loanwords with upsilon Υ. This letter represented the close front rounded vowel, both short and long: . Latin did not have this sound as a distinctive phoneme, and speakers tended to pronounce such loanwords with in Old Latin and in Classical and Late Latin if they were unable to produce .\n\nAn intermediate vowel sound (likely a close central vowel or possibly its rounded counterpart ), called \"sonus medius\", can be reconstructed for the classical period. Such a vowel is found in \"documentum\", \"optimus\", \"lacrima\" (also spelled \"docimentum\", \"optumus\", \"lacruma\") and other words. It developed out of a historical short , later fronted by vowel reduction. In the vicinity of labial consonants, this sound was not as fronted and may have retained some rounding.. It was sometimes spelled by the claudian letter Ⱶ ⱶ.\n\nVowels followed by a nasal consonant were allophonically realised as long nasal vowels in two environments:\nBULLET::::- Before word-final \"m\":\nBULLET::::- \"monstrum\" > .\nBULLET::::- \"dentem\" >\nBULLET::::- Before nasal consonants followed by a fricative:\nBULLET::::- \"censor\" > (in early inscriptions, often written as \"cesor\")\nBULLET::::- \"consul\" > (often written as \"cosol\" and abbreviated as \"cos\")\nBULLET::::- \"inferōs\" > (written as \"iferos\")\nThose long nasal vowels had the same quality as ordinary long vowels. In Vulgar Latin, the vowels lost their nasalisation, and they merged with the long vowels (which were themselves shortened by that time). This is shown by many forms in the Romance languages, such as Spanish \"costar\" from Vulgar Latin \"cōstāre\" (originally \"constāre\") and Italian \"mese\" from Vulgar Latin \"mēse\" (Classical Latin \"mensem\"). On the other hand, the short vowel and was restored in French \"enseigne\" and \"enfant\" from \"insignia\" and \"infantem\" (\"e\" is the normal development of Latin short \"i\"), likely by analogy with other forms beginning in the prefix \"in-\".\n\nWhen a final \"-m\" occurred before a plosive or nasal in the next word, however, it was pronounced as a nasal at the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, \"tan dūrum\" was written for \"tam dūrum\" in inscriptions, and \"cum nōbīs\" was a double entendre, possibly for \"cunnō bis\" .\n\n+ Diphthongs classified by beginning sound\n! !! Front !! Back\n! Close\n! Mid\n! Open\n\"ae\", \"oe\", \"au\", \"ei\", \"eu\" could represent diphthongs: \"ae\" represented , \"oe\" represented , \"au\" represented , \"ei\" represented , and \"eu\" represented . \"ui\" sometimes represented the diphthong , as in \"cui\" and \"huic\".\n\nIf there is a tréma above the second vowel, both vowels are pronounced separately: \"aë\" , \"aü\" , \"eü\" and \"oë\" .\n\nIn Old Latin, \"ae\", \"oe\" were written as \"ai\", \"oi\" and probably pronounced as , with a fully closed second element, similar to the final syllable in French . In the late Old Latin period, the last element of the diphthongs was lowered to , so that the diphthongs were pronounced and in Classical Latin. They were then monophthongized to and , starting in rural areas at the end of the Republican period. The process, however, does not seem to have been completed before the 3rd century AD in Vulgar Latin, and some scholars say that it may have been regular by the 5th century.\n\nVowel and consonant length were more significant and more clearly defined in Latin than in modern English. Length is the duration of time that a particular sound is held before proceeding to the next sound in a word. Unfortunately, \"vowel length\" is a confusing term for English speakers, who, in their language, call \"long vowels\" what are usually diphthongs rather than monophthongs. (That is a relic of the Great Vowel Shift, during which vowels that had once been pronounced phonemically longer turned into diphthongs.) In the modern spelling of Latin, especially in dictionaries and academic work, macrons are frequently used to mark long vowels: , while the breve is sometimes used to indicate that a vowel is short: .\n\nLong consonants were usually indicated through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did not distinguish between the vocalic and consonantal uses of \"i\" and \"v\". Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then through a variety of means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention of spelling long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet Lucius Accius. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an apex (a diacritic similar to an acute accent) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter (long i); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well. Distinctions of vowel length had become less important in later Latin and have ceased to be phonemic in the modern Romance languages, in which the previous long and short versions of the vowels have been either lost or replaced by other phonetic contrasts. However, distinctions of consonant length is still phonemic in the Romance language of Italian, as the Italian word \"nono\" means \"the ninth\" while the word \"nonno\" means \"grandfather\". Furthermore, Italian has restored at a later stage phonemic vowel length in few cases, as the Italian word \"corte\" means \"court\" while the word \"coorte\" means \"cohort\", or the word \"sentì\" (/senˈti/) means \"he heard\" while the word \"sentii\" (/senˈtiː/) means \"I heard\".\nA minimal set showing both long and short vowels and long and short consonants is \"ānus\" ('buttocks'), \"annus\" ('year'), \"anus\" ('old woman').\n\nThe letters \"b\", \"d\", \"f\", \"h\", \"m\", \"n\" are always pronounced as in English , , , , , respectively, and they do not usually cause any difficulties. The exceptions are mentioned below:\n\n+ Notes\n! Latin<br>grapheme !! Latin<br>phone !!

During this period, the word-initial stress triggered changes in the vowels of non-initial syllables, the effects of which are still visible in classical Latin. Compare for example:\nBULLET::::- \"faciō\" 'I do/make', \"factus\" 'made'; pronounced and in later Old Latin and Classical Latin.\nBULLET::::- \"afficiō\" 'I affect', \"affectus\" 'affected'; pronounced and in Old Latin following vowel reduction, and in Classical Latin.\nIn the earliest Latin writings, the original unreduced vowels are still visible. Study of this vowel reduction, as well as syncopation (dropping of short unaccented syllables) in Greek loan words, indicates that the stress remained word-initial until around the time of Plautus, in the 3rd century BC. The placement of the stress then shifted to become the pattern found in classical Latin.\n\nIn Classical Latin, stress changed. It moved from the first syllable to one of the last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for \"antepaenultima\" 'before almost last', \"paenultima\" 'almost last', and \"ultima syllaba\" 'last syllable'). Its position is determined by the syllable weight of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light and there are more than two syllables, the antepenult is accented. In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.\n\nTo determine stress, syllable weight of the penult must be determined. To determine syllable weight, words must be broken up into syllables. In the following examples, syllable structure is represented using these symbols: C (a consonant), K (a stop), R (a liquid), and V (a short vowel), VV (a long vowel or diphthong).\n\nEvery short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. This vowel forms the syllable nucleus. Thus \"magistrārum\" has four syllables, one for every vowel (a i ā u: V V VV V), \"aereus\" has three (ae e u: VV V V), \"tuō\" has two (u ō: V VV), and \"cui\" has one (ui: VV).\n\nA consonant before a vowel, or a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word, is placed in the same syllable as the following vowel. This consonant or consonant cluster forms the syllable onset.\nBULLET::::- \"fēminae\" (CVV.CV.CVV)\nBULLET::::- \"vidēre\" (CV.CVV.CV)\nBULLET::::- \"puerō\" (CV.V.CVV)\nBULLET::::- \"beātae\" (CV.VV.CVV)\nBULLET::::- \"graviter\" (CCV.CV.CVC)\nBULLET::::- \"strātum\" (CCCVV.CVC)\n\nAfter this, if there is an additional consonant inside the word, it is placed at the end of the syllable. This consonant is the syllable coda. Thus if a consonant cluster of two consonants occurs between vowels, they are broken up between syllables: one goes with the syllable before, the other with the syllable after.\nBULLET::::- \"puella\" (CV.VC.CV)\nBULLET::::- \"supersum\" (CV.CVC.CVC)\nBULLET::::- \"coāctus\" (CV.VVC.CVC)\nBULLET::::- \"intellēxit\" (VC.CVC.CVVC.CVC)\n\nThere are two exceptions. A consonant cluster of a stop \"p t c b d g\" followed by a liquid \"l r\" between vowels usually goes to the syllable after it, although it is also sometimes broken up like other consonant clusters.\nBULLET::::- \"volucris\" or (CV.CV.KRVC or CV.CVK.RVC)\n\nAs shown in the examples above, Latin syllables have a variety of possible structures. Here are some of them. The first four examples are light syllables, and the last six are heavy. All syllables have at least one V (vowel). A syllable is heavy if it has another V or a VC after the first V. In the table below, the extra V or VC is bolded, indicating that it makes the syllable heavy.\n! V !!\n! C !!\n! V !! C\n! V !!\n! C !!\n! V !! C\n\nThus, a syllable is heavy if it ends in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and a consonant, a long vowel and a consonant, or a diphthong and a consonant. Syllables ending in a diphthong and consonant are rare in Classical Latin.\n\nThe syllable onset has no relationship to syllable weight; both heavy and light syllables can have no onset or an onset of one, two, or three consonants.\n\nIn Latin a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called \"syllaba nātūrā longa\" ('syllable long by nature'), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called \"positiōne longa\" ('long by position'). These terms are translations of Greek \"συλλαβὴ μακρά φύσει\" (\"syllabḕ makrá phýsei\" = 'syllable long by nature') and \"μακρὰ θέσει\" (\"makrà thései\" = 'long by proposition'), respectively; therefore \"positiōne\" should not be mistaken for implying a syllable \"is long because of its position/place in a word\" but rather \"is treated as 'long' by convention\". This article uses the words \"heavy\" and \"light\" for syllables, and \"long\" and \"short\" for vowels since the two are not the same.\n\nIn a word of three or more syllables, the weight of the penult determines where the accent is placed. If the penult is light, accent is placed on the antepenult; if it is heavy, accent is placed on the penult. Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark before the stressed syllable.\n+ Words with stress on antepenult\n+ Words with stress on penult\n\nIambic shortening or \"brevis brevians\" is vowel shortening that occurs in words of the type \"light–heavy\", where the light syllable is stressed. By this sound change, words like \"egō\", \"modō\", \"benē\", \"amā\" with long final vowel change to \"ego\", \"modo\", \"bene\", \"ama\" with short final vowel.\n\nWhere one word ended with a vowel (including a nasalized vowel, represented by a vowel plus \"m\") and the next word began with a vowel, the former vowel, at least in verse, was regularly elided; that is, it was omitted altogether, or possibly (in the case of and ) pronounced like the corresponding semivowel. When the second word was \"est\" or \"et\", a different form of elision sometimes occurred (prodelision): the vowel of the preceding word was retained, and the \"e\" was elided instead. Elision also occurred in Ancient Greek, but in that language, it is shown in writing by the vowel in question being replaced by an apostrophe, whereas in Latin elision is not indicated at all in the orthography, but can be deduced from the verse form. Only occasionally is it found in inscriptions, as in \"scriptust\" for \"scriptum est\".\n\nModern usage, even for classical Latin texts, varies in respect of \"I\" and \"V\". During the Renaissance, the printing convention was to use \"I\" (upper case) and \"i\" (lower case) for both vocalic and consonantal , to use \"V\" in the upper case and in the lower case to use \"v\" at the start of words and \"u\" subsequently within the word regardless of whether and was represented.\n\nMany publishers (such as Oxford University Press) have adopted the convention of using \"I\" (upper case) and \"i\" (lower case) for both and , and \"V\" (upper case) and \"u\" (lower case) for both and .\n\nAn alternative approach, less common today, is to use \"i\" and \"u\" only for the vowels and \"j\" and \"v\" for the approximants.\n\nMost modern editions, however, adopt an intermediate position, distinguishing between \"u\" and \"v\" but not between \"i\" and \"j\". Usually, the non-vocalic \"v\" after \"q\" or \"g\" is still printed as \"u\" rather than \"v\", probably because in this position it did not change from to in post-classical times.\n\nTextbooks and dictionaries usually indicate the length of vowels by putting a macron or horizontal bar above the long vowel, but it is not generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a circumflex used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance, \"Româ\" ('from Rome' ablative) compared to \"Roma\" ('Rome' nominative). Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an acute accent over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they never heard it spoken aloud.\n\nSince around the beginning of the Renaissance period onwards, with the language being used as an international language among intellectuals, pronunciation of Latin in Europe came to be dominated by the phonology of local languages, resulting in a variety of different pronunciation systems.\n\nWhen Latin words are used as loanwords in a modern language, there is ordinarily little or no attempt to pronounce them as the Romans did; in most cases, a pronunciation suiting the phonology of the receiving language is employed.\n\nLatin words in common use in English are generally fully assimilated into the English sound system, with little to mark them as foreign, for example, \"cranium\", \"saliva\". Other words have a stronger Latin feel to them, usually because of spelling features such as the digraphs \"ae\" and \"oe\" (occasionally written as ligatures: \"æ\" and \"œ\", respectively), which both denote in English. The digraph \"ae\" or ligature \"æ\" in some words tend to be given an pronunciation, for example, \"curriculum vitae\".\n\nHowever, using loan words in the context of the language borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below on \"Derivative languages\").\n\nHowever, other languages—including Romance family members—all have their own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin. But English, Romance, or other teachers do not always point out that the particular accent their students learn is not actually the way ancient Romans spoke.\n\nBecause of the central position of Rome within the Catholic Church, an Italian pronunciation of Latin became commonly accepted, but this was not the case until the latter part of the 19th century. This pronunciation corresponds to that of the Latin-derived words in Italian. Before then, the pronunciation of Latin in church was the same as the pronunciation as Latin in other fields and tended to reflect the sound values associated with the nationality of the speaker.. Other ecclesiastical variations are still in use (e.g. Germanic pronunciations), especially outside the Roman Catholic church.\n\nThe following are the main points that distinguish modern Italianate ecclesiastical pronunciation from Classical Latin pronunciation:\n\nThe letters \"b\", \"d\", \"f\", \"m\", \"n\" are always pronounced as in English , , , , respectively, and they do not usually cause any difficulties.

As a result, the automatic stress accent of Classical Latin, which was dependent on vowel length, becomes a phonemic one in Ecclesiastical Latin. (Some Ecclesiastical texts mark the stress with an acute accent in words of three or more syllables.)\nBULLET::::- Word-final \"m\" and \"n\" are pronounced fully, with no nasalization of the preceding vowel.\n\nIn his \"Vox Latina: A guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin\", William Sidney Allen remarked that this pronunciation, used by the Catholic Church in Rome and elsewhere, and whose adoption Pope Pius X recommended in a 1912 letter to the Archbishop of Bourges, \"is probably less far removed from classical Latin than any other 'national' pronunciation\"; but, as can be seen from the table above, there are, nevertheless, very significant differences. The introduction to the \"Liber Usualis\" indicates that Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation should be used at Church liturgies. The Pontifical Academy for Latin is the pontifical academy in the Vatican that is charged with the dissemination and education of Catholics in the Latin language.\n\nOutside of Austria, Germany, Czechia and Slovakia, it is the most widely used standard in choral singing which, with a few exceptions like Stravinsky's \"Oedipus rex\", is concerned with liturgical texts. Anglican choirs adopted it when classicists abandoned traditional English pronunciation after World War II. The rise of historically informed performance and the availability of guides such as Copeman's \"Singing in Latin\" has led to the recent revival of regional pronunciations.\n\nBecause it gave rise to many modern languages, Latin did not \"die\"; it merely evolved over the centuries in different regions in diverse ways. The local dialects of Vulgar Latin that emerged eventually became modern Italian, Spanish, French, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, Romansh, Dalmatian, Sardinian, and many others.\n\nKey features of Vulgar Latin and Romance languages include:\n\nBULLET::::- Almost total loss of and final unstressed .\nBULLET::::- Conversion of the distinction of vowel length into a distinction of height, and subsequent merger of some of these phonemes. Most Romance languages merged short with long and short with long .\nBULLET::::- Monophthongization of into and into .\nBULLET::::- Loss of marginal phonemes such as aspirates (, , and ), which became tenues, and the close front-rounded vowel , which became unrounded.\nBULLET::::- Loss of before (CL \"spōnsa\" > VL \"spōsa\") but this influence on the later development of Romance languages was limited from written influence, analogy, and learned borrowings.\nBULLET::::- Palatalization of before and (not in all varieties), probably first into and then before it finally developed into or .\nBULLET::::- Palatalization of before and , and of , into (not in all varieties) and then further into in some Romance varieties.\nBULLET::::- Palatalization of followed by a vowel (if not preceded by s, t, x) into . It merged with in dialects in which had developed into this sound, but it remained separate elsewhere (such as Italian).\nBULLET::::- Palatalization of and followed by a vowel into and . (orthographic \"gn\") also coalesced to become .\nBULLET::::- The change of (except after ) and between vowels, into .\n\nThe following examples are both in verse, which demonstrates several features more clearly than prose.\n\nVirgil's \"Aeneid\", Book 1, verses 1–4.

{"id": "18000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18000", "title": "Latin conjugation", "text": "Latin conjugation\n\nConjugation has two meanings. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. It may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, mood, aspect, voice, or other language-specific factors. \n\nThe second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.\n\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin , a calque of the Greek syzygia, literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\n\nFor simple verb paradigms, see the Wiktionary appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\n\nThe ancient Romans themselves, beginning with Varro (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations ( \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus), 4th century AD), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an \"a\", an \"e\" or an \"i\" in it. However, others, such as Sacerdos (3rd century AD), Dositheus (4th century AD) and Priscian (c. 500 AD), recognised four different groups.\n\nModern grammarians generally recognise four conjugations, according to whether their active present infinitive has the ending -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre (or the corresponding passive forms), for example: (1) \"to love\", (2) \"to see\", (3) \"to rule\" and (4) \"to hear\". There are also some verbs of mixed conjugation, having some endings like the 3rd and others like the 4th conjugation, for example, \"to capture\".\n\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most important of these is the verb \"to be\". There also exist deponent and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as defective verbs (verbs in which some of the tenses are missing).\n\nThe grouping in conjugations is based on the behaviour of the verb in the present system; the stems for other tenses cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\n\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are therefore listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs) which allow the reader to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\nBULLET::::1. the first person singular of the present indicative active\nBULLET::::2. the present infinitive active\nBULLET::::3. the first person singular of the perfect indicative active\nBULLET::::4. the supine or, in some grammars, the perfect passive participle, which uses the same stem. (Texts that list the perfect passive participle use the future active participle for intransitive verbs.) Some verbs lack this principal part altogether.\n\nThe present infinitive active form shows the verb's conjugation.\n\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel \"ā\" and can be recognized by the \"-āre\" ending of the present active infinitive form. The non-perfect tenses conjugate as follows:\n!\n!colspan=\"3\"Indicative\n!colspan=\"2\"Subjunctive\n!\nPresentFutureImperfectPresentImperfect\n!rowspan=2Active\n\"I love\"\"I will love\"\"I was loving\"  \"I may love\"\"I might love\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\n!\n!rowspan=2Passive\n\"I am loved\"\"I will be loved\"\"I was being loved\"   \"I may be loved\" \"I might be loved\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The 2nd person singular passive ' can be shortened to '. \"-re\" was the regular form in early Latin and (except in the present indicative) in Cicero; \"-ris\" was preferred later.\n\nIn early Latin (Plautus), the 3rd singular endings \"-at\" and \"-et\" were pronounced \"-āt\" and \"-ēt\" with a long vowel.\n\nOther forms:\n\nBULLET::::- Infinitive: \"to love\"\nBULLET::::- Passive infinitive: ' \"to be loved\" (in early Latin often ')\nBULLET::::- Imperative: ' (pl. ') \"love!\"\nBULLET::::- Future imperative: ' (pl. ') \"love! (at a future time)\"\nBULLET::::- Passive imperative: ' (pl. ') \"be loved!\" (usually only found in deponent verbs)\nBULLET::::- Present participle: ' (pl. ') \"loving\"\nBULLET::::- Future participle: ' (pl. ') \"going to love\"\nBULLET::::- Gerundive: ' (pl. ') \"needing to be loved\"\nBULLET::::- Gerund: ' \"of loving\", ' \"by/for loving\", \"in order to love\"\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix \"-āvī\". The majority of first-conjugation verbs follow this pattern, which is considered to be \"regular\", for example:\nBULLET::::- , \"to love\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to order\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to praise\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to deny\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to announce, report\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to beg, pray\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to prepare\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to carry\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to fight\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to think\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to ask\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to save\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to call\";\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix \"-uī\", for example:\nBULLET::::- , \"to rub\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to cut, to divide\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to forbid, to prohibit\";\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix \"–ī\" and vowel lengthening in the stem, for example:\nBULLET::::- , \"to help, to assist\";\nBULLET::::- , \"to wash, to bathe\";\nBULLET::::- perfect is reduplicated, for example:\nBULLET::::- , \"to give\"\nBULLET::::- , \"to stand\";\n\nThe verb ' \"I give\" is irregular in that except in the 2nd singular ' and imperative ', the \"a\" is short, e.g. ' \"I will give\".\n\nThe \"a\" is also short in the supine ' and its derivatives, but the other parts of ' \"I stand\" are regular.\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:\n\nThe three perfect tenses of the 1st conjugation go as in the following table:\n\n!\n!colspan=\"3\"Indicative\n!colspan=\"2\"Subjunctive\n!\nPerfectFuture perfectPluperfectPerfectPluperfect\n!rowspan=2Active\n\"I loved\"\"I will have loved\"\"I had loved\"  \"I loved\"\"I had loved\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\n!\n!rowspan=2Passive\n\"I was loved\"\"I will have been loved\"\"I had been loved\"   \"I was loved\" \"I had been loved\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\nIn poetry (and also sometimes in prose, e.g. Livy), the 3rd person plural of the perfect indicative is often ' instead of '. Occasionally the form is also found.\n\nIn early Latin, the future perfect indicative had a short \"i\" in , but by the time of Cicero these forms were usually pronounced with a long \"i\", in the same way as in the perfect subjunctive. Virgil has a short \"i\" for both tenses; Horace uses both forms for both tenses; Ovid uses both forms for the future perfect, but a long \"i\" in the perfect subjunctive.\n\nThe \"-v-\" of the perfect active tenses sometimes drops out, especially in the pluperfect subjunctive: ' for '. Forms such as ' and ' are also found.\n\nThe passive tenses also have feminine and neuter forms, e.g. ' \"she was loved\", ' \"it was announced\".\n\nForms made with instead of and instead of are also found. See Latin tenses.\n\nFor other meanings of the perfect and pluperfect subjunctive, see Latin tenses#Perfect subjunctive.\n\nOther forms:\n\nBULLET::::- Perfect infinitive active: ' (') \"to have loved\"\nBULLET::::- Perfect infinitive passive: \"to have been loved\"\nBULLET::::- Perfect participle passive: \"loved (by someone)\"\n\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel ē, and can be recognized by the -eō ending of the first person present indicative and the -ēre ending of the present active infinitive form: \n\n!\n!colspan=\"3\"Indicative\n!colspan=\"2\"Subjunctive\n!\nPresentFutureImperfectPresentImperfect\n!rowspan=2Active\n\"I see\"\"I will see\"\"I was seeing\"  \"I may see\"\"I might see\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\n!\n!rowspan=2Passive\n\"I am seen\"\"I will be seen\"\"I was being seen\"   \"I may be seen\" \"I might be seen\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\nThe passive also often means \"I seem\".\n\nOther forms:\n\nBULLET::::- Infinitive: \"to see\"\nBULLET::::- Passive infinitive: \"to be seen\"\nBULLET::::- Imperative: ' (pl.

') \"needing to be seen\"\nBULLET::::- Gerund: ' \"of seeing\", ' \"by /for seeing\", \"in order to see\"\n\nThe principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix -uī. Verbs which follow this pattern are considered to be \"regular\". Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to owe, be obliged\"\nBULLET::::- \"to teach, to instruct\"\nBULLET::::- \"to lie (on the ground/bed)\"\nBULLET::::- \"to deserve\"\nBULLET::::- \"to mix\"\nBULLET::::- \"to warn, advise\"\nBULLET::::- \"to be harmful\"\nBULLET::::- \"to provide, show\"\nBULLET::::- \"to hold, to keep\"\nBULLET::::- \"to frighten, to deter\"\nBULLET::::- \"to fear\"\nBULLET::::- \"to be strong\"\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix –ēvī. Example:\nBULLET::::- \"to destroy\"\nBULLET::::- \"to weep\"\n\nIn verbs with perfect in \"-vī\", syncopated (i.e. abbreviated) forms are common, such as for .\n\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix –īvī. Example:\nBULLET::::- \"to arouse, to stir\"\nBULLET::::- perfect has the suffix -sī (which combines with a preceding c or g to –xī). Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to burn\"\nBULLET::::- \"to increase, to enlarge\"\nBULLET::::- \"to stick, to adhere, to get stuck\"\nBULLET::::- \"to order\"\nBULLET::::- \"to remain\"\nBULLET::::- \"to persuade\"\nBULLET::::- \"to laugh\"\nBULLET::::- perfect is reduplicated with -ī. Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to bite\"\nBULLET::::- \"to vow, to promise\"\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to be cautious\"\nBULLET::::- \"to favour\"\nBULLET::::- \"to caress, to cherish\"\nBULLET::::- \"to sit\"\nBULLET::::- \"to see\"\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -ī. Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to reply\"\nBULLET::::- \"to hiss, to creak\" (also 3rd conj.)\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of , but and have a perfect participle with \"ss\":\n\nThe following are semi-deponent, that is, they are deponent only in the three perfect tenses:\n\nThe third conjugation has a variable short stem vowel, which may be e, i,or u in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in –ere in the present active infinitive.\n!\n!colspan=\"3\"Indicative\n!colspan=\"2\"Subjunctive\n!\nPresentFutureImperfectPresentImperfect\n!rowspan=2Active\n\"I lead\"\"I will lead\"\"I was leading\"  \"I may lead\"\"I might lead\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\n!\n!rowspan=2Passive\n\"I am led\"\"I will be led\"\"I was being led\"   \"I may be led\" \"I might be led\"\n\"Iyou sg.he, she, itweyou pl.they\"\n\nThe future tense in the 3rd and 4th conjugation (\"-am, -ēs, -et\" etc.) differs from that in the 1st and 2nd conjugation (\"-bō, -bis, -bit\" etc.). \n\nOther forms:\n\nBULLET::::- Infinitive: \"to lead\"\nBULLET::::- Passive infinitive: \"to be led\" (the 3rd conjugation has no \"r\")\nBULLET::::- Imperative: ' (pl.

Others, like \"run!\", have the ending \"-e\".\n\nThere is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -sī (-xī when c or h comes at the end of the root). Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to pluck, to select\"\nBULLET::::- \"to yield, depart\"\nBULLET::::- \"to close\"\nBULLET::::- \"to despise, disdain, treat with contempt\"\nBULLET::::- \"to say\"\nBULLET::::- \"to divide\"\nBULLET::::- \"to lead\"\nBULLET::::- \"to bend, to twist\"\nBULLET::::- \"to wear, to bear; wage (war)\"\nBULLET::::- \"to send\"\nBULLET::::- \"to rule\"\nBULLET::::- \"to write\"\nBULLET::::- \"to cover, conceal\"\nBULLET::::- \"to drag, to pull\"\nBULLET::::- \"to live\"\n\nBULLET::::- perfect is reduplicated with suffix –ī.

Although is transitive, its compounds are intransitive:\n\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -vī. Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to smear, to daub\" (also 4th conj. )\nBULLET::::- \"to seek, to attack\"\nBULLET::::- \"to look for, ask\"\nBULLET::::- \"to sow, to plant\"\nBULLET::::- \"to spread, to stretch out\"\nBULLET::::- \"to rub, to wear out\"\n\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -ī and vowel lengthening in the stem. If the present stem has an \"n\" infix, as in and , it disappears in the perfect. Examples:\nBULLET::::- \"to do, to drive\"\nBULLET::::- \"to compel, gather together\"\nBULLET::::- \"to buy\"\nBULLET::::- \"to pour\"\nBULLET::::- \"to collect, to read\"\nBULLET::::- \"to leave behind\"\nBULLET::::- \"to burst\"\nBULLET::::- \"to conquer, to defeat\"\n\nBULLET::::- perfect has suffix -ī only.

The verbs used are:\n\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future passive, and future active.\nBULLET::::- The present active participle is declined as a 3rd declension adjective. The ablative singular is \"-e\", but the plural follows the i-stem declension with genitive \"-ium\" and neuter plural \"-ia\".\nBULLET::::- The perfect passive participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.\nBULLET::::- In all conjugations, the perfect participle is formed by removing the \"–um\" from the supine, and adding a \"–us\" (masculine nominative singular).\nBULLET::::- The future active participle is declined like a 1st and 2nd declension adjective.\nBULLET::::- In all conjugations the \"-um\" is removed from the supine, and an \"-ūrus\" (masculine nominative singular) is added.\nBULLET::::- The future passive participle, more usually called the gerundive, is formed by taking the present stem, adding \"-nd-\", and the usual first and second declension endings. Thus forms . The usual meaning is \"needing to be praised\", expressing a sense of obligation.\n\n!rowspan=\"2\"\n!colspan=\"10\" Participles\n! \n! \n! \n! Present active\n\n! Perfect passive\n\n! Future active\n\n! Gerundive\n\nThere are seven main infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active, future passive, and potential active. Further infinitives can be made using the gerundive.\nBULLET::::- The present active infinitive is the second principal part (in regular verbs). It plays an important role in the syntactic construction of Accusative and infinitive, for instance.\nBULLET::::- means, \"to praise.\"\nBULLET::::- The present passive infinitive is formed by adding a \"–rī\" to the present stem. This is only so for the first, second and fourth conjugations. In the third conjugation, the thematical vowel, \"e\", is taken from the present stem, and an \"–ī\" is added.\nBULLET::::- translates as \"to be praised.\"\nBULLET::::- The perfect active infinitive is formed by adding an \"–isse\" onto the perfect stem.\nBULLET::::- translates as \"to have praised.\"\nBULLET::::- The perfect passive infinitive uses the perfect passive participle along with the auxiliary verb . The perfect passive infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).\nBULLET::::- means, \"to have been praised.\"\nBULLET::::- The future active infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb .\nBULLET::::- means, \"to be going to praise.\" The future active infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number, gender, and case (nominative or accusative).\nBULLET::::- has two future infinitives: and\nBULLET::::- The future passive infinitive uses the supine with the auxiliary verb . Because the first part is a supine, the ending \"-um\" does not change for gender or number.\nBULLET::::- is translated as \"to be going to be praised.\" This is normally used in indirect speech. For example: \"He hopes that he will be acquitted.\"\nBULLET::::- The potential infinitive uses the future active participle with the auxiliary verb .\nBULLET::::- is used only in indirect statements to represent a potential imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive of direct speech. It is translated with \"would\" or \"would have\". For example: (Quintilian) 'it seems unlikely that he would have told a lie, if he had not been desperate'\n\n+Infinitives (with masculine endings used for participles)\n! \n! \n! \n\n! Present active\n\n! Present passive\n\n! Perfect active\n\n! Perfect passive\n\n! Future active\n\n! Future passive\n\n! Potential\n\nThe future passive infinitive was not very commonly used. The Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, followed by a subjunctive clause.\n\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\nBULLET::::- The accusative form ends in a \"–um\", and is used with a verb of motion in order to show purpose. Thus it is only used with verbs like \"to go\", \"to come\", etc. The accusative form of a supine can also take an object if needed.\nBULLET::::- – The father came to praise his children.\nBULLET::::- The ablative, which ends in a \"–ū\", is used with the Ablative of Specification.\nBULLET::::- – These arms were the easiest to praise.\n{ class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"\n!colspan=\"5\" Supine\n! \n! \n! \n! Accusative\n\n! Ablative\n\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the \"-ns\" becomes an \"-ndus\", and the preceding \"ā\" or \"ē\" is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form can mean \"of praiseing\", the dative form can mean \"for praiseing\", the accusative form can mean \"praiseing\", and the ablative form can mean \"by praiseing\", \"in respect to praiseing\", etc.\n!rowspan=\"2\"\n!colspan=\"6\" Gerund\n! \n! \n! \n! Accusative\n! Genitive\n\n! Dative\n! Ablative\n\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition to indicate purpose. For example, could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction is preferred over .\n\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with part of the verb , to show obligation.\n\nBULLET::::- \"The boy needs to be praised\"\nBULLET::::- means \"The speech is to be praised\". In such constructions a substantive in dative may be used to identify the agent of the obligation (), as in meaning \"The speech is to be praised by us\" or \"We must praise the speech\".\n\n!colspan=\"5\" Gerundive\n! \n! \n! \n\nAn older form of the 3rd and 4th conjugation gerundive ends in \"-undum\", e.g. ( for ). This ending is also found with the gerundive of 'I go': 'it is necessary to go'.\n\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\n\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\n\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of . It is translated as \"I am going to praise,\" \"I was going to praise\", etc.\n\n! !! Conjugation !! Translation\n! Pres. ind.\n! Imp. ind.\n! Fut. ind.\n! Perf. ind.\n! Plup. ind.\n!

Perf. inf.\n\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning. These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of , and there are no forms like \"loquō\", \"loquis\", \"loquit\", etc.\n\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, changed to \"mirar(e)\" by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and changed to \"osar(e)\" by taking the participle and making an \"-ar(e)\" verb out of it (note that \"au\" went to \"o\").\n\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\nBULLET::::- Some verbs are conjugated only in the perfective aspect's tenses, yet have the imperfective aspect's tenses' meanings. As such, the perfect becomes the present, the pluperfect becomes the imperfect, and the future perfect becomes the future. Therefore, the defective verb \"ōdī\" means, \"I hate.\" These defective verbs' principal parts are given in vocabulary with the indicative perfect in the first person and the perfect active infinitive. Some examples are:\n\nBULLET::::- A few verbs, the meanings of which usually have to do with speech, appear only in certain occurrences.\n\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\n\n!rowspan=\"3\"\n!colspan=\"8\" Conjugation of \n!colspan=\"2\" Indicativepresent\n!colspan=\"2\" Indicativeimperfect\n!colspan=\"2\" Subjunctivepresent\n!colspan=\"2\" Imperativepresent\n\n!

In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems,\" or \"it is raining\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part.

{"id": "18002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18002", "title": "Louisa May Alcott", "text": "Louisa May Alcott\n\nLouisa May Alcott (; November 29, 1832March 6, 1888) was an American novelist, short story writer and poet best known as the author of the novel \"Little Women\" (1868) and its sequels \"Little Men\" (1871) and \"Jo's Boys\" (1886). Raised in New England by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott, she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nAlcott's family suffered from financial difficulties, and while she worked to help support the family from an early age, she also sought an outlet in writing. She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s. Early in her career, she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard, under which she wrote novels for young adults that focused on spies and revenge.\n\nPublished in 1868, \"Little Women\" is set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts, and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters, Abigail May Alcott Nieriker, Elizabeth Sewall Alcott, and Anna Alcott Pratt. The novel was well-received at the time and is still a popular children's novel today. It has been adapted to film several times.\n\nAlcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life. She died from a stroke, two days after her father died, in Boston on March 6, 1888.\n\nLouisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, which is now part of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on her father's 33rd birthday. She was the daughter of transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and social worker Abby May and the second of four daughters: Anna Bronson Alcott was the eldest; Elizabeth Sewall Alcott and Abigail May Alcott were the two youngest. The family moved to Boston in 1834, where Alcott's father established an experimental school and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Bronson Alcott's opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing as well as his moments of mental instability shaped young Alcott's mind with a desire to achieve perfection, a goal of the transcendentalists. His attitudes towards Alcott's wild and independent behavior, and his inability to provide for his family, created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters. Abigail resented her husband's inability to recognize her sacrifices and related his thoughtlessness to the larger issue of the inequality of sexes. She passed this recognition and desire to redress wrongs done to women on to Louisa.\n\nIn 1840, after several setbacks with the school, the Alcott family moved to a cottage on of land, situated along the Sudbury River in Concord, Massachusetts. The three years they spent at the rented Hosmer Cottage were described as idyllic. By 1843, the Alcott family moved, along with six other members of the Consociate Family, to the Utopian Fruitlands community for a brief interval in 1843–1844. After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands, they moved on to rented rooms and finally, with Abigail May Alcott's inheritance and financial help from Emerson, they purchased a homestead in Concord. They moved into the home they named \"Hillside\" on April 1, 1845, but moved in 1852, selling to Nathaniel Hawthorne who renamed it The Wayside. Moving 22 times in 30 years, the Alcotts returned to Concord once again in 1857 and moved into Orchard House, a two-story clapboard farmhouse, in the spring of 1858.\nAlcott's early education included lessons from the naturalist Henry David Thoreau who inspired her to write \"Thoreau's Flute\" based on her time at Walden's Pond. Most of the education she received though, came from her father who was strict and believed in \"the sweetness of self-denial.\" She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margaret Fuller, and Julia Ward Howe, all of whom were family friends. She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled \"Transcendental Wild Oats.\" The sketch was reprinted in the volume \"Silver Pitchers\" (1876), which relates the family's experiment in \"plain living and high thinking\" at Fruitlands.\n\nPoverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher, seamstress, governess, domestic helper, and writer. Her sisters also supported the family, working as seamstresses, while their mother took on social work among the Irish immigrants. Only the youngest, May, was able to attend public school. Due to all of these pressures, writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott. Her first book was \"Flower Fables\" (1849), a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson, daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott is quoted as saying \"I wish I was rich, I was good, and we were all a happy family this day\" and was driven in life not to be poor.\n\nIn 1847, she and her family served as station masters on the Underground Railroad, when they housed a fugitive slave for one week and had discussions with Frederick Douglass. Alcott read and admired the \"Declaration of Sentiments\", published by the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights, advocating for women's suffrage and became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts in a school board election. The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts, and in 1854 Louisa found solace at the Boston Theatre where she wrote The Rival Prima Donnas, which she later burned due to a quarrel between the actresses on who would play what role. At one point in 1857, unable to find work and filled with such despair, Alcott contemplated suicide. During that year, she read Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Brontë and found many parallels to her own life. In 1858, her younger sister Elizabeth died, and her older sister Anna married a man named John Pratt. This felt, to Alcott, to be a breaking up of their sisterhood.\n\nAs an adult, Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist. In 1860, Alcott began writing for the \"Atlantic Monthly\". When the American Civil War broke out, she served as a nurse in the Union Hospital at Georgetown, DC, for six weeks in 1862–1863. She intended to serve three months as a nurse, but halfway through she contracted typhoid and became deathly ill, though she eventually recovered. Her letters homerevised and published in the Boston anti-slavery paper \"Commonwealth\" and collected as \"Hospital Sketches\" (1863, republished with additions in 1869)brought her first critical recognition for her observations and humor. She wrote about the mismanagement of hospitals and the indifference and callousness of some of the surgeons she encountered. Her main character, Tribulation Periwinkle, showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a \"serious and eloquent witness\". Her novel \"Moods\" (1864), based on her own experience, was also promising.\n\nAfter her service as a nurse, Alcott's father wrote her a heartfelt poem titled \"To Louisa May Alcott. From her father\". The poem describes how proud her father is of her for working as a nurse and helping injured soldiers as well as bringing cheer and love into their home. He ends the poem by telling her she's in his heart for being a selfless faithful daughter. This poem was featured in the book \"Louisa May Alcott: Her Life, Letters, and Journals (1889)\". This poem is also featured in the book \"Louisa May Alcott, the Children's Friend\" that talks about her childhood and close relationship with her father.\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Alcott wrote passionate, fiery novels and sensational stories under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard. Among these are \"A Long Fatal Love Chase\" and \"Pauline's Passion and Punishment\". Her protagonists for these books are strong and smart. She also produced stories for children, and after they became popular, she did not go back to writing for adults. Other books she wrote are the novelette \"A Modern Mephistopheles\" (1875), which people thought Julian Hawthorne wrote, and the semi-autobiographical novel \"Work\" (1873).\n\nAlcott became even more successful with the first part of \"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy\" (1868), a semi-autobiographical account of her childhood with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts, published by the Roberts Brothers. Alcott originally delayed writing the novel, seeing herself incapable of writing a story for girls, despite her publisher, Thomas Niles' urges for her to do so. Part two, or \"Part Second\", also known as \"Good Wives\" (1869), followed the March sisters into adulthood and marriage. \"Little Men\" (1871) detailed Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she founded with her husband Professor Bhaer at the conclusion of Part Two of \"Little Women\". \"Jo's Boys\" (1886) completed the \"March Family Saga\". \n\nIn \"Little Women\", Alcott based her heroine \"Jo\" on herself. But whereas Jo marries at the end of the story, Alcott remained single throughout her life. She explained her \"spinsterhood\" in an interview with Louise Chandler Moulton, \"I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body. … because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.” However, Alcott's romance while in Europe with the young Polish man Ladislas \"Laddie\" Wisniewski was detailed in her journals but then deleted by Alcott herself before her death. Alcott identified Laddie as the model for Laurie in \"Little Women\". Likewise, every character seems to be paralleled to some extent, from Beth's death mirroring Lizzie's to Jo's rivalry with the youngest, Amy, as Alcott felt a sort of rivalry for (Abigail) May, at times. Though Alcott never married, she did take in May's daughter, Louisa, after May's death in 1879 from childbed fever, caring for little \"Lulu\" until her death.\n\n\"Little Women\" was well received, with critics and audiences finding it suitable for many age groups. A reviewer of \"Eclectic Magazine\" called it \"the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty\". It was a fresh, natural representation of daily life. With the success of \"Little Women\", Alcott shied away from the attention and would sometimes act as a servant when fans would come to her house.\nAlong with Elizabeth Stoddard, Rebecca Harding Davis, Anne Moncure Crane, and others, Alcott was part of a group of female authors during the Gilded Age, who addressed women's issues in a modern and candid manner. Their works were, as one newspaper columnist of the period commented, \"among the decided 'signs of the times'\".\n\nIn 1877 Alcott was one of the founders of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston. After her youngest sister May died in 1879, Louisa took over for the care of niece, Lulu, who was named after Louisa. Alcott suffered chronic health problems in her later years, including vertigo. She and her earliest biographers attributed her illness and death to mercury poisoning. During her American Civil War service, Alcott contracted typhoid fever and was treated with a compound containing mercury. Recent analysis of Alcott's illness, however, suggests that her chronic health problems may have been associated with an autoimmune disease, not mercury exposure. Moreover, a late portrait of Alcott shows a rash on her cheeks, which is a characteristic of lupus.\n\nAlcott died of a stroke at age 55 in Boston, on March 6, 1888, two days after her father's death. Lulu, her niece was only 8 years old when Louisa died. Louisa's last known words were \"Is it not meningitis?\" She is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, near Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau, on a hillside now known as \"Authors' Ridge\".\n\nLouisa frequently wrote in her journals about going on runs up until she died. She challenged the social norms regarding gender by encouraging her young female readers to run as well.\n\nHer Boston home is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Her childhood home Orchard House is now a museum that pays homage to Louisa May Alcott and her family that focuses on education. In addition, Harriet Reisen wrote \"Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind \"Little Women\"\" which later became a film that was directed by Nancy Porter and aired on PBS television.

{"id": "18004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18004", "title": "LALR parser", "text": "LALR parser\n\nIn computer science, an LALR parser or Look-Ahead LR parser is a simplified version of a canonical LR parser, to parse (separate and analyze) a text according to a set of production rules specified by a formal grammar for a computer language. (\"LR\" means left-to-right, rightmost derivation.)\n\nThe LALR parser was invented by Frank DeRemer in his 1969 PhD dissertation, \"Practical Translators for LR(k) languages\", in his treatment of the practical difficulties at that time of implementing LR(1) parsers. He showed that the LALR parser has more language recognition power than the LR(0) parser, while requiring the same number of states as the LR(0) parser for a language that can be recognized by both parsers. This makes the LALR parser a memory-efficient alternative to the LR(1) parser for languages that are LALR. It was also proven that there exist LR(1) languages that are not LALR. Despite this weakness, the power of the LALR parser is sufficient for many mainstream computer languages, including Java, though the reference grammars for many languages fail to be LALR due to being ambiguous.\n\nThe original dissertation gave no algorithm for constructing such a parser given a formal grammar. The first algorithms for LALR parser generation were published in 1973. In 1982, DeRemer and Tom Pennello published an algorithm that generated highly memory-efficient LALR parsers. LALR parsers can be automatically generated from a grammar by an LALR parser generator such as Yacc or GNU Bison. The automatically generated code may be augmented by hand-written code to augment the power of the resulting parser.\n\nIn 1965, Donald Knuth invented the LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). The LR parser can recognize any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. Rightmost derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical due to the limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the Look-Ahead LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser that had much lower memory requirements at the cost of less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented but still the LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.\n\nIn 1979, Frank DeRemer and Tom Pennello announced a series of optimizations for the LALR parser that would further improve its memory efficiency. Their work was published in 1982.\n\nGenerally, the LALR parser refers to the LALR(1) parser, just as the LR parser generally refers to the LR(1) parser. The \"(1)\" denotes one-token lookahead, to resolve differences between rule patterns during parsing. Similarly, there is an LALR(2) parser with two-token lookahead, and LALR(\"k\") parsers with \"k\"-token lookup, but these are rare in actual use. The LALR parser is based on the LR(0) parser, so it can also be denoted LALR(1) = LA(1)LR(0) (1 token of lookahead, LR(0)) or more generally LALR(\"k\") = LA(\"k\")LR(0) (k tokens of lookahead, LR(0)). There is in fact a two-parameter family of LA(\"k\")LR(\"j\") parsers for all combinations of \"j\" and \"k\", which can be derived from the LR(\"j\" + \"k\") parser, but these do not see practical use.\n\nAs with other types of LR parsers, an LALR parser is quite efficient at finding the single correct bottom-up parse in a single left-to-right scan over the input stream, because it does not need to use backtracking. Being a lookahead parser by definition, it always uses a lookahead, with being the most-common case.\n\nThe LALR(1) parser is less powerful than the LR(1) parser, and more powerful than the SLR(1) parser, though they all use the same production rules. The simplification that the LALR parser introduces consists in merging rules that have identical kernel item sets, because during the LR(0) state-construction process the lookaheads are not known. This reduces the power of the parser because not knowing the lookahead symbols can confuse the parser as to which grammar rule to pick next, resulting in reduce/reduce conflicts. All conflicts that arise in applying a LALR(1) parser to an unambiguous LR(1) grammar are reduce/reduce conflicts. The SLR(1) parser performs further merging, which introduces additional conflicts.\n\nThe standard example of an LR(1) grammar that cannot be parsed with the LALR(1) parser, exhibiting such a reduce/reduce conflict, is:\n\nIn the LALR table construction, two states will be merged into one state and later the lookaheads will be found to be ambiguous. The one state with lookaheads is:\n\nAn LR(1) parser will create two different states (with non-conflicting lookaheads), neither of which is ambiguous. In an LALR parser this one state has conflicting actions (given lookahead c or d, reduce to E or F), a \"reduce/reduce conflict\"; the above grammar will be declared ambiguous by a LALR parser generator and conflicts will be reported.\n\nTo recover, this ambiguity is resolved by choosing E, because it occurs before F in the grammar. However, the resultant parser will not be able to recognize the valid input sequence codice_1, since the ambiguous sequence codice_2 is reduced to codice_3, rather than the correct codice_4, but codice_5 is not in the grammar.\n\nThe LALR(\"j\") parsers are incomparable with LL(\"k\") parsers: for any \"j\" and \"k\" both greater than 0, there are LALR(\"j\") grammars that are not LL(\"k\") grammars and conversely. In fact, it is undecidable whether a given LL(1) grammar is LALR(\"k\") for any formula_1.\n\nDepending on the presence of empty derivations, a LL(1) grammar can be equal to a SLR(1) or a LALR(1) grammar. If the LL(1) grammar has no empty derivations it is SLR(1) and if all symbols with empty derivations have non-empty derivations it is LALR(1). If symbols having only an empty derivation exist, the grammar may or may not be LALR(1).\n\nBULLET::::- Comparison of parser generators\nBULLET::::- Context-free grammar\nBULLET::::- Lookahead\nBULLET::::- Parser generator\nBULLET::::- Token scanner\n\n\nBULLET::::- Parsing Simulator This simulator is used to generate parsing tables LALR and resolve the exercises of the book.\nBULLET::::- JS/CC JavaScript based implementation of a LALR(1) parser generator, which can be run in a web-browser or from the command-line.\nBULLET::::- LALR(1) tutorial, a flash card-like tutorial on LALR(1) parsing.\n"}
{"id": "18008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18008", "title": "Language center", "text": "Language center\n\nThe term language center (or more accurately centers, e.g. Broca's area and Wernicke's area) refers to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production. Language is a core system, which gives humans the capacity to solve difficult problems and provides them with a unique type of social interaction. Language allows individuals to attribute symbols (e.g. words or signs) to specific concepts and display them through sentences and phrases that follow proper grammatical rules. Moreover, speech is the mechanism in which language is orally expressed.Information is exchanged in a larger system including language-related regions. These regions are connected by white matter fiber tracts that make possible the transmission of information between regions. The white matter fibers bunches were recognized to be important for language production after suggesting that it is possible to make a connection between multiple language centers. The three classical language areas that are involved in language production and processing are Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, and angular gyrus.\n\nBroca's Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was the analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this region of the brain, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Paul Broca had a patient called Leborgne who could only pronounce the word “tan” when speaking. Paul Broca, after working with another patient with similar impairment, concluded that damage in the inferior frontal gyrus affected articulate language.\n\nBroca’s area is well-known for being the syntactic processing  “center”. It has been known since Paul Broca associated speech production with an area in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, which he called “Broca’s area”. Although this area is in charge of speech production, its particular role in the language system is unknown. However, it is involved in phonological, semantic, and syntactic processing and working memory. The anterior region of Broca’s area is involved in semantic processing, while the posterior region in the phonological processing (Bohsali, 2015). Moreover, the whole of Broca’s area has been shown to have a higher activation while doing reading tasks than other types of tasks.\n\nIn a simple explanation of speech production, this area approaches phonological word representation chronologically divided into segments of syllables which then is sent to different motor areas where they are converted into a phonetic code. The study of how this area produces speech has been made with paradigms using both single and complex words.\n\nBroca’s area is correlated with phonological segmentation, unification, and syntactic processing, which are all connected to linguistic information. This area, although it synchronizes the transformation of information within cortical systems involved in spoken word production, does not contribute to the production of single words. The inferior frontal lobe is the one in charge of word production.\nFurthermore, Broca’s area is structurally related to the thalamus and both are engaged in language processing. The connectivity between both areas is two thalamic nuclei, the pulvinar, and the ventral nucleus, which are involved in language processing and linguistic functions similar to BA 44 and 45 in Broca’s area. Pulvinar is connected to many frontal regions of the frontal cortex and ventral nucleus is involved in speech production. The frontal speech regions of the brain have been shown to participate in speech sound perception.\n\nBroca's Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.\n\nWernicke’s area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak).This area of the brain is involved in language comprehension. Therefore, Wernicke’s area is for understanding oral language. Besides Wernicke’s area, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and angular gyrus (AG) participate in language comprehension. Therefore, language comprehension is not located in a specific area. Contrarily, it involves large regions of the inferior parietal lobe and left temporal.\n\nWhile the finale of speech production is a sequence of muscle movements, the activation of knowledge about the sequence of phonemes (consonants and vowel speech sounds) that creates a word is a phonological retrieval. Wernicke’s area contributes to phonological retrieval. All speech production tasks (e.g. word retrieval, repetition, and reading aloud) require phonological retrieval. The phonological retrieval system involved in speech repetition is the auditory phoneme perception system and the visual letter perception system is the one that serves for reading aloud. The communicative speech production entails a phase preceding phonological retrieval. The speech comprehension implicates representing sequences of phonemes onto word meaning.\n\nThe angular gyrus is an important element in processing concrete and abstract concepts. It also has a role in verbal working memory during retrieval for verbal information and in visual memory for when turning written language into spoken language. The left AG is activated in semantic processing requiring concept retrieval and conceptual integration. Moreover, the left AG is activated during problems of multiplication and addition requiring retrieval of arithmetic factors in verbal memory. Therefore, it is involved in verbal coding of numbers.\n\nThe insula is implicated in speech and language, partaking of functional and structural connections with motor, linguistic, sensory, and limbic brain areas. The knowledge about the function of the insula in speech production comes from different studies with patients who suffered from apraxia of speech. These studies have led researchers to know about the involvement of different parts of the insula. These parts are: the left anterior insula, which is related to speech production; and the bilateral anterior insula, involved in misleading speech comprehension.\n\nMany different sources state that the study of the brain and therefore, language disorders, originated in the 19th century and linguistic analysis of those disorders began throughout the 20th century. Studying language impairments in the brain after injuries aids to comprehend how the brain works and how it changes after an injury. When this happens, the brain suffers an impairment that is referred to as “aphasia”. Lesions to Broca's Area resulted primarily in disruptions to speech production; damage to Wernicke's Area, which is located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, lead mainly to disruptions in speech reception.\n\nThere are numerous distinctive ways in which language can be affected. Phonemic paraphasia, an attribute of conduction aphasia and Wernicke aphasia, is not the speech comprehension impairment. Instead, it is the speech production damage, where the desire phonemes are selected erroneously or in an incorrect sequence. Therefore, although Wernicke’s aphasia, a combination of phonological retrieval and semantic systems impairment, affects speech comprehension, it also involves speech production damage. Phonemic paraphasia and anomia (impaired word retrieval) are the results of phonological retrieval impairment.\n\nAnother lesion that involves impairment in language production and processing is the “apraxia of speech”, a difficulty synchronizing articulators essential for speech production. This lesion is located in the superior pre-central gyrus of the insula and is more likely to occur to patients with Broca’s aphasia. Dominant ventral anterior (VA) nucleus, another type of lesion, is the result of word-finding and semantic paraphasia’s difficulties engaging in language processing. Moreover, individuals with thalamic lesions experience difficulties linking semantic concepts with correct phonological representations in word production.\n\nDyslexia is a language processing disorder. It involves learning difficulties such as reading, writing, word recognition, phonological recording, numeracy, and spelling. Although having access to appropriate intervention during childhood, these difficulties continue throughout the lifespan. Moreover, children are diagnosed with dyslexia when more than one factor affecting learning, such as reading, appears visible. Children diagnosed with dyslexia that have difficulties in concrete cognitive functioning is called an assumption of specificity, and it helps to diagnose dyslexia.\n\nSome characteristics that distinguish dyslexics are incompetent phonological processing abilities causing misread of unfamiliar words and affecting comprehension; inadequacy of working memory affecting speaking, reading, and writing; errors in oral reading; oral skills difficulties as expressing oneself; and writing skills problems like expressing and spelling errors. Dyslexics not only experience learning difficulties but also other secondary characteristics as having difficulties organizing, planning, social interactions, motor skills, visual perception, and short-term memory. These characteristics affect personal and academic life.\n\nDysarthria is a motor speech disorder caused by damage in the central and/or peripheral nervous system and it is related to degenerative neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dysarthria is caused by a mechanical difficulty in the vocal cords or neurological disease-producing abnormal articulation of phonemes, such as instead of “b” a “p”. A type of dyspraxia based on distortions of words is called apraxic dysarthria This type is related to facial apraxia and motor aphasia if Broca’s area is involved.\n\nImprovements in computer technology, in the late 20th century, has allowed a better understanding of the correlation between brain and language, and the disorder that this entails. This improvement has permitted a better visualization of the brain structure in high resolution three-dimensional images. It has also allowed to observe brain activity through the blood flow (Dronkers, Ivanova, & Baldo, 2017).\n\nNew medical imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique used for locating, in the brain, particular functions to different activity related. This technique shows the location and magnitude of neural activity variations, influenced by external stimulation and fluctuation at rest. MRI is a technique that was developed in the 20th century to observe brain activity in healthy and abnormal brains. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a technique use for track white matter bundles \"in vivo\" and gives information of the internal fibrous structure by the measure of water diffusion. This diffusion tensor is used for infer white matter connectivity.\n\nIn the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex. Indeed, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. Since then, a whole series of relatively large areas of the brain are involved in speech processing. In more recent research, subcortical regions (those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the putamen and the caudate nucleus), as well as the pre-motor areas (BA 6), have received increased attention. It is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the primary and secondary auditory cortices play a fundamental role in speech processing:\n\n·       \"Superior temporal gyrus\" (STG): morphosyntactic processing (anterior section), integration of syntactic and semantic information (posterior section)\n\n·       \"Inferior frontal gyrus\" (IFG, Brodmann area (BA) 45/47): syntactic processing, working memory\n\n·       \"Inferior frontal gyrus\" (IFG, BA 44): syntactic processing, working memory\n\n·       \"Middle temporal gyrus\" (MTG): lexical semantic processing\n\n·       Angular gyrus (AG): semantic processes (posterior temporal cortex)\n\nThe left hemisphere is usually dominant in right-handed people, although bilateral activations are not uncommon in the area of syntactic processing. It is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important role in the processing of suprasegmental acoustic features like prosody; which is “the rhythmic and melodic variations in speech”. There are two types of prosodic information: emotional prosody (right hemisphere), which is the emotional that the speaker gives to the speech, and linguistic prosody (left hemisphere), the syntactic and thematic structure of the speech.\n\nMost areas of speech processing develop in the second year of life in the dominant half (hemisphere) of the brain, which often (though not necessarily) corresponds to the opposite of the dominant hand. 98% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant, and the majority of left-handed people are as well.\n\nComputerized tomographic (CT) scans is another technique of the 1970s, which produce low spatial resolution but provides the location of the injury \"in vivo\". Moreover, Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping (VLSM) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) techniques contributed to the understanding that specific brain regions have different roles when supporting speech processing. VLSM has been used to observe complex language functions sustained by different regions. Furthermore, VBM is a helpful technique to analysis language impairments related to neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe differentiation of speech production into only two large sections of the brain (i.e. Broca's and Wernicke's areas), that was accepted long before the advent of medical imaging techniques, is now considered outdated. Broca's Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was the analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this region of the brain, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions to Broca's Area resulted primarily in disruptions to speech production. Damage to Wernicke's Area, which is located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, lead mainly to disruptions in speech reception. This area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak).\n\nBroca's Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.\n\nIn summary, these early research efforts demonstrated that semantic and structural speech production takes place in different areas of the brain.\n\nBULLET::::- Language module\n\nBULLET::::- Donald Loritz: \"How the Brain evolved Language\", Oxford University Press 1999, (hardcover), (paperback)\nBULLET::::- Friederici, A.D.: \"Towards a neural basis of auditory sentence processing\".

{"id": "18009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18009", "title": "Lift (force)", "text": "Lift (force)\n\nA fluid flowing past the surface of a body exerts a force on it. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. It contrasts with the drag force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity, but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow.\n\nIf the surrounding fluid is air, the force is called an aerodynamic force. In water or any other liquid, it is called a hydrodynamic force.\n\nDynamic lift is distinguished from other kinds of lift in fluids. Aerostatic lift or buoyancy, in which an internal fluid is lighter than the surrounding fluid, does not require movement and is used by balloons, blimps, dirigibles, boats, and submarines. Planing lift, in which only the lower portion of the body is immersed in a liquid flow, is used by motorboats, surfboards, and water-skis.\n\nA fluid flowing past the surface of a body exerts a force on it. It makes no difference whether the fluid is flowing past a stationary body or the body is moving through a stationary volume of fluid. Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction. Lift is always accompanied by a drag force, which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction.\n\nLift is mostly associated with the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, although it is more widely generated by many other streamlined bodies such as propellers, kites, helicopter rotors, racing car wings, maritime sails, and wind turbines in air, and by sailboat keels, ship's rudders, and hydrofoils in water. Lift is also exploited by flying and gliding animals, especially by birds, bats, and insects, and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees.\n\nWhile the common meaning of the word \"lift\" assumes that lift opposes weight, lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity, since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity. When an aircraft is cruising in straight and level flight, most of the lift opposes gravity. However, when an aircraft is climbing, descending, or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical. Lift may also act as downforce in some aerobatic manoeuvres, or on the wing on a racing car. Lift may also be largely horizontal, for instance on a sailing ship.\n\nThe lift discussed in this article is mainly in relation to airfoils, although marine hydrofoils and propellers share the same physical principles and work in the same way, despite differences between air and water such as density, compressibility, and viscosity.\n\nAn airfoil is a streamlined shape that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag. A flat plate can generate lift, but not as much as a streamlined airfoil, and with somewhat higher drag.\n\nThere are several ways to explain how an airfoil generates lift. Some are more complicated or more physically rigorous than others; some have been shown to be incorrect. For example, there are explanations based directly on Newton's laws of motion and explanations based on Bernoulli's principle. Either can be used to explain lift.\n\nAn airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is lift.\n\nThe airflow changes direction as it passes the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then Newton's third law requires the air to exert an upward force on the airfoil; thus a reaction force, lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.\n\nThe downward turning of the flow is not produced solely by the lower surface of the airfoil, and the air flow above the airfoil accounts for much of the downward-turning action.\n\nBernoulli's principle states that there is a direct mathematical relationship between the pressure of a fluid and the speed of that fluid, so if one knows the speed at all points within the airflow one can calculate the pressure, and vice versa. For any airfoil generating lift, there must be a pressure imbalance, i.e. lower average air pressure on the top than on the bottom. Bernoulli's principle states that this pressure difference must be accompanied by a speed difference.\n\nStarting with the flow pattern observed in both theory and experiments, the increased flow speed over the upper surface can be explained in terms of streamtube pinching and conservation of mass.\n\nFor incompressible flow, the rate of volume flow (e.g. volume units per minute) must be constant within each streamtube since matter is not created or destroyed. If a streamtube becomes narrower, the flow speed must increase in the narrower region to maintain the constant flow rate, to satisfy the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nThe upper streamtubes constrict as they flow up and around the airfoil. Conservation of mass says that the flow speed must increase as the stream tube area decreases. Similarly, the lower streamtubes expand and their flowrate slows.\n\nFrom Bernoulli's principle, the pressure on the upper surface where the flow is moving faster is lower than the pressure on the lower surface where it is moving slower. This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward.\n\nAs explained below under a more comprehensive physical explanation, producing a lift force requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli's principle. The simplified explanations given above are therefore incomplete because they define lift in terms of only one or the other. And depending on the details, they have other shortcomings as well.\n\nThe explanation based on flow deflection and Newton's laws is correct but is incomplete. It does not explain how the airfoil can impart downward turning to a much deeper swath of the flow than it actually touches. Further, it doesn't explain how the pressure differences in the horizontal direction are sustained. That is, it leaves out the Bernoulli part of the interaction.\n\nExplanations based on increased flow speed and Bernoulli's principle first try to establish that there is higher flow speed over the upper surface, but they fail to explain correctly what causes the flow to speed up:\n\nBULLET::::- The conservation of mass explanation that relies on narrowing of the streamtubes over the upper surface does not explain why the streamtubes change size. To see why the air flows the way it does requires more sophisticated analysis.\nBULLET::::- Sometimes a geometrical argument is offered to demonstrate why the streamtubes change size: it is asserted that the top \"obstructs\" or \"constricts\" the air more than the bottom, hence narrower streamtubes. For conventional wings that are flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes some intuitive sense. But it does not explain how flat plates, symmetric airfoils, sailboat sails, or conventional airfoils flying upside down can generate lift, and attempts to calculate lift based on the amount of constriction do not predict experimental results.\nBULLET::::- A common version that relies on equal-transit-time is simply wrong, as explained below under false explanation based on equal transit-time.\n\nBernoulli-only explanations imply that a speed difference arises from causes other than a pressure difference, and that the speed difference then leads to a pressure difference by Bernoulli’s principle. This implied one-way causation is a misconception. The real cause-and-effect relationship between pressure and velocity is reciprocal. Finally, Bernoulli-only explanations don't explain how the pressure differences in the vertical direction are sustained. That is, they leave out the downward-turning part of the interaction.\n\nMany alternative explanations for the generation of lift by an airfoil have been put forward, most intended to explain the phenomenon of lift to a general audience. Although the explanations may share features in common with the explanations above, additional assumptions and simplifications may be introduced. Some explanations introduce assumptions which proved to be wrong, such as \"equal transit-time\", and some used controversial terminology, such as \"Coandă effect\".\n\nBasic or popular sources often describe the \"equal transit-time\" theory of lift, which incorrectly assumes that the parcels of air that divide at the leading edge of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge, forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster. Bernoulli's principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing, the air pressure must be higher, pushing the wing up.\n\nHowever, there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false. In fact, the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves \"much\" \"faster\" than the equal transit theory predicts. Further, the theory violates Newton's third law of motion, since it describes a force on the wing with no opposite force.\n\nThe assertion that the air must arrive simultaneously at the trailing edge is sometimes referred to as the \"equal transit-time fallacy\".\n\nIn its original sense, the \"Coandă effect\" refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow, and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow. The effect is named for Henri Coandă, the Romanian aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents.\n\nMore broadly, some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet. It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil. Jef Raskin, for example, describes a simple demonstration, using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing. The wing deflects upwards, thus demonstrating that the Coandă effect creates lift. This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coandă effect as a fluid jet (the exhaust from a straw) adhering to a curved surface (the wing). However, the upper surface in this flow is a complicated, vortex-laden mixing layer, while on the lower surface the flow is quiescent. The physics of this demonstration are very different from that of the general flow over the wing. The usage in this sense is encountered in some popular references on aerodynamics. This is a controversial use of the term \"Coanda effect.\" The more established view in the aerodynamics field is that the Coandă effect is defined in the more limited sense above, and the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary-layer separation; thus it is not an example of the Coandă effect.\n\nLift is a result of pressure differences and depends on angle of attack, airfoil shape, air density, and airspeed.\n\nPressure is the normal force per unit area exerted by the air on itself and on surfaces that it touches. The lift force is transmitted through the pressure, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Thus, the net force manifests itself as pressure differences. The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil is lower than the average pressure on the underside.\n\nThese pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. When a fluid follows a curved path, there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences, sometimes called the streamline curvature theorem, was derived from Newton's second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754:\n\nThe left side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow. On the right hand side ρ is the density, v is the velocity, and R is the radius of curvature. This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow (R → ∞) the pressure difference is zero.\n\nThe angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the oncoming airflow. A symmetrical airfoil will generate zero lift at zero angle of attack. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift. For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack.\n\nAs the angle of attack increases, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift. The airfoil is said to be stalled.\n\nThe lift force depends on the shape of the airfoil, especially the amount of camber (curvature such that the upper surface is more convex than the lower surface, as illustrated at right). Increasing the camber generally increases lift.\n\nCambered airfoils will generate lift at zero angle of attack. When the chord line is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward. When a cambered airfoil is upside down, the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upwards. This explains how a plane can fly upside down.\n\nThe ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density, viscosity and speed of flow. Density is affected by temperature, and by the medium's acoustic velocity - i.e. by compressibility effects.\n\nLift is proportional to the density of the air and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed. Lift also depends on the size of the wing, being generally proportional to the wing's area projected in the lift direction. In calculations it is convenient to quantify lift in terms of a lift coefficient based on these factors.\n\nNo matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems, any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules. Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities. The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material, it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface, and the air's velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface (i.e., the air molecules \"stick\" to the surface instead of sliding along it), something known as the no-slip condition. Because the air at the surface has near-zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving, there is a thin boundary layer in which air close to the surface is subjected to a shearing motion. The air's viscosity resists the shearing, giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil's surface called skin friction drag. Over most of the surface of most airfoils, the boundary layer is naturally turbulent, which increases skin friction drag.\n\nUnder usual flight conditions, the boundary layer remains attached to both the upper and lower surfaces all the way to the trailing edge, and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest. Compared to the predictions of inviscid flow theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related pressure drag over and above the skin friction drag. The total of the skin friction drag and the viscosity-related pressure drag is usually called the profile drag.\n\nAn airfoil's maximum lift at a given airspeed is limited by boundary-layer separation. As the angle of attack is increased, a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface. When the boundary layer separates, it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface, as illustrated in the flow-visualization photo at right. This is known as the \"stall\", or \"stalling\". At angles of attack above the stall, lift is significantly reduced, though it does not drop to zero. The maximum lift that can be achieved before stall, in terms of the lift coefficient, is generally less than 1.5 for single-element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high-lift slotted flaps and leading-edge devices deployed.\n\nThe flow around bluff bodies – i.e. without a streamlined shape, or stalling airfoils – may also generate lift, in addition to a strong drag force. This lift may be steady, or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding. Interaction of the object's flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex-induced vibrations. For instance, the flow around a circular cylinder generates a Kármán vortex street: vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder's sides. The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder, even though the net (mean) force is negligible. The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number, which depends on the Reynolds number of the flow.\n\nFor a flexible structure, this oscillatory lift force may induce vortex-induced vibrations. Under certain conditions – for instance resonance or strong spanwise correlation of the lift force – the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced. Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial chimneys.\n\nIn the Magnus effect, a lift force is generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream. Here the mechanical rotation acts on the boundary layer, causing it to separate at different locations on the two sides of the cylinder. The asymmetric separation changes the effective shape of the cylinder as far as the flow is concerned such that the cylinder acts like a lifting airfoil with circulation in the outer flow.\n\nAs described above under \"Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil\", there are two main popular explanations: one based on downward deflection of the flow (Newton's laws), and one based on pressure differences accompanied by changes in flow speed (Bernoulli's principle). Either of these, by itself, correctly identifies some aspects of the lifting flow but leaves other important aspects of the phenomenon unexplained. A more comprehensive explanation involves both downward deflection and pressure differences (including changes in flow speed associated with the pressure differences), and requires looking at the flow in more detail.\n\nThe airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.\n\nThe net force exerted by the air occurs as a pressure difference over the airfoil's surfaces. Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense, so that pressure must always be thought of as pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces. The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the pressure on the wing's upper surface and increasing the pressure on the lower surface. The pressure on the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced pressure on the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.\n\nThe pressure difference which results in lift acts directly on the airfoil surfaces; however, understanding how the pressure difference is produced requires understanding what the flow does over a wider area.\n\nAn airfoil affects the speed and direction of the flow over a wide area, producing a pattern called a \"velocity field\". When an airfoil produces lift, the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, the flow above and below the airfoil is deflected downward, and the flow behind the airfoil is deflected upward again, leaving the air far behind the airfoil in the same state as the oncoming flow far ahead. The flow above the upper surface is sped up, while the flow below the airfoil is slowed down. Together with the upward deflection of air in front and the downward deflection of the air immediately behind, this establishes a net circulatory component of the flow. The downward deflection and the changes in flow speed are pronounced and extend over a wide area, as can be seen in the flow animation on the right. These differences in the direction and speed of the flow are greatest close to the airfoil and decrease gradually far above and below. All of these features of the velocity field also appear in theoretical models for lifting flows.\n\nThe pressure is also affected over a wide area, in a pattern of non-uniform pressure called a \"pressure field\". When an airfoil produces lift, there is a diffuse region of low pressure above the airfoil, and usually a diffuse region of high pressure below, as illustrated by the isobars (curves of constant pressure) in the drawing. The pressure difference that acts on the surface is just part of this pressure field.\n\nThe non-uniform pressure exerts forces on the air in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The direction of the force is different at different locations around the airfoil, as indicated by the block arrows in the \"pressure distribution with isobars\" figure. Air above the airfoil is pushed toward the center of the low-pressure region, and air below the airfoil is pushed outward from the center of the high-pressure region.\n\nAccording to \"Newton's second law\", a force causes air to accelerate in the direction of the force. Thus the vertical arrows in the \"pressure distribution with isobars\" figure indicate that air above and below the airfoil is accelerated, or turned downward, and that the non-uniform pressure is thus the cause of the downward deflection of the flow visible in the flow animation. To produce this downward turning, the airfoil must have a positive angle of attack or have its rear portion curved downward as on an airfoil with camber. Note that the downward turning of the flow over the upper surface is the result of the air being pushed downward by higher pressure above it than below it. Some explanations that refer to the \"Coandă effect\" suggest that viscosity plays a key role in the downward turning, but this is false. (see below under \"Controversy regarding the Coandă effect\").\n\nThe arrows ahead of the airfoil indicate that the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, and the arrows behind the airfoil indicate that the flow behind is deflected upward again, after being deflected downward over the airfoil. These deflections are also visible in the flow animation.\n\nThe arrows ahead of the airfoil and behind also indicate that air passing through the low-pressure region above the airfoil is sped up as it enters, and slowed back down as it leaves. Air passing through the high-pressure region below the airfoil sees the opposite - it is slowed down and then sped up. Thus the non-uniform pressure is also the cause of the changes in flow speed visible in the flow animation. The changes in flow speed are consistent with \"Bernoulli's principle\", which states that in a steady flow without viscosity, lower pressure means higher speed, and higher pressure means lower speed.\n\nThus changes in flow direction and speed are directly caused by the non-uniform pressure. But this cause-and-effect relationship is not just one-way; it works in both directions simultaneously. The air's motion is affected by the pressure differences, but the existence of the pressure differences depends on the air's motion. The relationship is thus a mutual, or reciprocal, interaction: Air flow changes speed or direction in response to pressure differences, and the pressure differences are sustained by the air's resistance to changing speed or direction. A pressure difference can exist only if something is there for it to push against. In aerodynamic flow, the pressure difference pushes against the air's inertia, as the air is accelerated by the pressure difference. This is why the air's mass is part of the calculation, and why lift depends on air density.\n\nSustaining the pressure difference that exerts the lift force on the airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure in a wide area around the airfoil. This requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli's principle. The pressure differences and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain each other in a mutual interaction. The pressure differences follow naturally from Newton's second law and from the fact that flow along the surface follows the predominantly downward-sloping contours of the airfoil. And the fact that the air has mass is crucial to the interaction.\n\nProducing a lift force requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli's principle. Each of the simplified explanations given above in Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil falls short by trying to explain lift in terms of only one or the other, thus explaining only part of the phenomenon and leaving other parts unexplained. \n\nWhen the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface is known, determining the total lift requires adding up the contributions to the pressure force from local elements of the surface, each with its own local value of pressure. The total lift is thus the integral of the pressure, in the direction perpendicular to the farfield flow, over the airfoil surface.\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere:\nBULLET::::- S is the projected (planform) area of the airfoil, measured normal to the mean airflow;\nBULLET::::- n is the normal unit vector pointing into the wing;\nBULLET::::- k is the vertical unit vector, normal to the freestream direction.\n\nThe above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces, which are small compared to the pressure forces.\n\nBy using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral, we obtain an expression for the pressure drag \"D\" (which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the induced drag). If we use the spanwise vector j, we obtain the side force \"Y\".\n\nThe validity of this integration generally requires the airfoil shape to be a closed curve that is piecewise smooth.\n\nLift depends on the size of the wing, being approximately proportional to the wing area. It is often convenient to quantify the lift of a given airfoil by its \"lift coefficient\" formula_4, which defines its overall lift in terms of a unit area of the wing.\n\nIf the value of formula_4 for a wing at a specified angle of attack is given, then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined:\n\nwhere \nBULLET::::- formula_7 is the lift force\nBULLET::::- formula_8 is the air density\nBULLET::::- formula_9 is the velocity or true airspeed\nBULLET::::- formula_10 is the planform (projected) wing area\nBULLET::::- formula_4 is the lift coefficient at the desired angle of attack, Mach number, and Reynolds number\n\nMathematical theories of lift are based on continuum fluid mechanics, assuming that air flows as a continuous fluid. Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics, the most relevant being the following three principles:\nBULLET::::- Conservation of momentum, which is a consequence of Newton's laws of motion, especially Newton's second law which relates the net force on an element of air to its rate of momentum change,\nBULLET::::- Conservation of mass, including the assumption that the airfoil's surface is impermeable for the air flowing around, and\nBULLET::::- Conservation of energy, which says that energy is neither created nor destroyed.\n\nBecause an airfoil affects the flow in a wide area around it, the conservation laws of mechanics are embodied in the form of partial differential equations combined with a set of boundary condition requirements which the flow has to satisfy at the airfoil surface and far away from the airfoil.\n\nTo predict lift requires solving the equations for a particular airfoil shape and flow condition, which generally requires calculations that are so voluminous that they are practical only on a computer, through the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Determining the net aerodynamic force from a CFD solution requires \"adding up\" (integrating) the forces due to pressure and shear determined by the CFD over every surface element of the airfoil as described under \"pressure integration\".\n\nThe Navier–Stokes equations (NS) provide the potentially most accurate theory of lift, but in practice, capturing the effects of turbulence in the boundary layer on the airfoil surface requires sacrificing some accuracy, and requires use of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS). Simpler but less accurate theories have also been developed.\n\nThese equations represent conservation of mass, Newton's second law (conservation of momentum), conservation of energy, the Newtonian law for the action of viscosity, the Fourier heat conduction law, an equation of state relating density, temperature, and pressure, and formulas for the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid.\n\nIn principle, the NS equations, combined with boundary conditions of no through-flow and no slip at the airfoil surface, could be used to predict lift in any situation in ordinary atmospheric flight with high accuracy. However, airflows in practical situations always involve turbulence in the boundary layer next to the airfoil surface, at least over the aft portion of the airfoil. Predicting lift by solving the NS equations in their raw form would require the calculations to resolve the details of the turbulence, down to the smallest eddy. This is not yet possible, even on the most powerful current computer. So in principle the NS equations provide a complete and very accurate theory of lift, but practical prediction of lift requires that the effects of turbulence be modeled in the RANS equations rather than computed directly.\n\nThese are the NS equations with the turbulence motions averaged over time, and the effects of the turbulence on the time-averaged flow represented by turbulence modeling (an additional set of equations based on a combination of dimensional analysis and empirical information on how turbulence affects a boundary layer in a time-averaged average sense). A RANS solution consists of the time-averaged velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil.\n\nThe amount of computation required is a minuscule fraction (billionths) of what would be required to resolve all of the turbulence motions in a raw NS calculation, and with large computers available it is now practical to carry out RANS calculations for complete airplanes in three dimensions. Because turbulence models are not perfect, the accuracy of RANS calculations is imperfect, but it is adequate for practical aircraft design. Lift predicted by RANS is usually within a few percent of the actual lift.\n\nThe Euler equations are the NS equations without the viscosity, heat conduction, and turbulence effects. As with a RANS solution, an Euler solution consists of the velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil. While the Euler equations are simpler than the NS equations, they do not lend themselves to exact analytic solutions.\n\nFurther simplification is available through potential flow theory, which reduces the number of unknowns to be determined, and makes analytic solutions possible in some cases, as described below.\n\nEither Euler or potential-flow calculations predict the pressure distribution on the airfoil surfaces roughly correctly for angles of attack below stall, where they might miss the total lift by as much as 10-20%. At angles of attack above stall, inviscid calculations do not predict that stall has happened, and as a result they grossly overestimate the lift.\n\nIn potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be irrotational, i.e. that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation. Mathematically, this is expressed by the statement that the curl of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero. Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential. A flow represented in this way is called potential flow.\n\nIn potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be incompressible. Incompressible potential-flow theory has the advantage that the equation (Laplace's equation) to be solved for the potential is linear, which allows solutions to be constructed by superposition of other known solutions. The incompressible-potential-flow equation can also be solved by conformal mapping, a method based on the theory of functions of a complex variable. In the early 20th century, before computers were available, conformal mapping was used to generate solutions to the incompressible potential-flow equation for a class of idealized airfoil shapes, providing some of the first practical theoretical predictions of the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil.\n\nA solution of the potential equation directly determines only the velocity field. The pressure field is deduced from the velocity field through Bernoulli's equation.\n\nApplying potential-flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption. The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil (See \"Circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem\" below), but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation. The solution to this problem is to introduce a branch cut, a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance, and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut. The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented. However, the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions, and the solution is thus indeterminate. A potential-flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition, which is that, of all the possible solutions, the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift, in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge, and another flow pattern with positive lift, in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition.\n\nThis is potential-flow theory with the further assumptions that the airfoil is very thin and the angle of attack is small. The linearized theory predicts the general character of the airfoil pressure distribution and how it is influenced by airfoil shape and angle of attack, but is not accurate enough for design work. For a 2D airfoil, such calculations can be done in a fraction of a second in a spreadsheet on a PC.\n\nWhen an airfoil generates lift, several components of the overall velocity field contribute to a net circulation of air around it: the upward flow ahead of the airfoil, the accelerated flow above, the decelerated flow below, and the downward flow behind.\n\nThe circulation can be understood as the total amount of \"spinning\" (or vorticity) of an inviscid fluid around the airfoil.\n\nThe Kutta–Joukowski theorem relates the lift per unit width of span of a two-dimensional airfoil to this circulation component of the flow. It is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a starting vortex is formed and left behind, leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil. Lift is then inferred from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This explanation is largely mathematical, and its general progression is based on logical inference, not physical cause-and-effect.\n\nThe Kutta–Joukowski model does not predict how much circulation or lift a two-dimensional airfoil will produce. Calculating the lift per unit span using Kutta–Joukowski requires a known value for the circulation. In particular, if the Kutta condition is met, in which the rear stagnation point moves to the airfoil trailing edge and attaches there for the duration of flight, the lift can be calculated theorically through the conformal mapping method.\n\nThe lift generated by a conventional airfoil is dictated by both its design and the flight conditions, such as forward velocity, angle of attack and air density. Lift can be increased by artificially increasing the circulation, for example by boundary-layer blowing or the use of blown flaps. In the Flettner rotor the entire airfoil is circular and spins about a spanwise axis to create the circulation.\n\nThe flow around a three-dimensional wing involves significant additional issues, especially relating to the wing tips. For a wing of low aspect ratio, such as a typical delta wing, two-dimensional theories may provide a poor model and three-dimensional flow effects can dominate. Even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span can affect the whole span, not just close to the tips.\n\nThe vertical pressure gradient at the wing tips causes air to flow sideways, out from under the wing then up and back over the upper surface. This reduces the pressure gradient at the wing tip, therefore also reducing lift. The lift tends to decrease in the spanwise direction from root to tip, and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the spanwise direction. Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend to look like the illustration at right. This spanwise-varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field. Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard, flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward, and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard, which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right.\n\nThere is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two-dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift, and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two-dimensional flow. The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making, as if the freestream flow were tilted downward, with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions. The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift-induced drag.\n\nThe difference in the spanwise component of velocity above and below the wing (between being in the inboard direction above and in the outboard direction below) persists at the trailing edge and into the wake downstream. After the flow leaves the trailing edge, this difference in velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet.\n\nThe wingtip flow leaving the wing creates a tip vortex. As the main vortex sheet passes downstream from the trailing edge, it rolls up at its outer edges, merging with the tip vortices. The combination of the wingtip vortices and the vortex sheets feeding them is called the vortex wake.\n\nIn addition to the vorticity in the trailing vortex wake there is vorticity in the wing's boundary layer, called 'bound vorticity', which connects the trailing sheets from the two sides of the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe. The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907.\n\nGiven the distribution of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake, the Biot–Savart law (a vector-calculus relation) can be used to calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field, caused by the lift on the wing. Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift-induced drag of three-dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing's horseshoe vortex system. In these theories, the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing.\n\nBecause the velocity is deduced from the vorticity in such theories, some authors describe the situation to imply that the vorticity is the cause of the velocity perturbations, using terms such as \"the velocity induced by the vortex\", for example. But attributing mechanical cause-and-effect between the vorticity and the velocity in this way is not consistent with the physics. The velocity perturbations in the flow around a wing are in fact produced by the pressure field.\n\nThe flow around a lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton's second law regarding conservation of momentum, both locally at every point in the flow field, and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow. For an extended region, Newton's second law takes the form of the \"momentum theorem for a control volume\", where a control volume can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis. The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume (a surface integral), is equal to the integrated time rate of change (material derivative) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume. For a steady flow, this can be expressed in the form of the net surface integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary.\n\nThe lifting flow around a 2D airfoil is usually analyzed in a control volume that completely surrounds the airfoil, so that the inner boundary of the control volume is the airfoil surface, where the downward force per unit span formula_12 is exerted on the fluid by the airfoil. The outer boundary is usually either a large circle or a large rectangle. At this outer boundary distant from the airfoil, the velocity and pressure are well represented by the velocity and pressure associated with a uniform flow plus a vortex, and viscous stress is negligible, so that the only force that must be integrated over the outer boundary is the pressure. The free-stream velocity is usually assumed to be horizontal, with lift vertically upward, so that the vertical momentum is the component of interest.\n\nFor the free-air case (no ground plane), the force formula_12 exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary, in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary, as shown in the diagram at right. For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall, the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible, and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom. For a square or circle, the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each. For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide, the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible, and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes, with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift, and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half.\n\nThe results of all of the control-volume analyses described above are consistent with the Kutta–Joukowski theorem described above. Both the tall rectangle and circle control volumes have been used in derivations of the theorem.\n\nAn airfoil produces a pressure field in the surrounding air, as explained under \"The wider flow around the airfoil\" above. The pressure differences associated with this field die off gradually, becoming very small at large distances, but never disappearing altogether. Below the airplane, the pressure field persists as a positive pressure disturbance that reaches the ground, forming a pattern of slightly-higher-than-ambient pressure on the ground, as shown on the right. Although the pressure differences are very small far below the airplane, they are spread over a wide area and add up to a substantial force. For steady, level flight, the integrated force due to the pressure differences is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane's weight. According to Newton's third law, this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal-and-opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground, which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane. The net force due to the lift, acting on the atmosphere as a whole, is therefore zero, and thus there is no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere, as was noted by Lanchester early in the development of modern aerodynamics.\nBULLET::::- Drag coefficient\nBULLET::::- Flow separation\nBULLET::::- Fluid dynamics\nBULLET::::- Foil (fluid mechanics)\nBULLET::::- Küssner effect\nBULLET::::- Lift-to-drag ratio\nBULLET::::- Lifting-line theory\nBULLET::::- Spoiler (automotive)\n\n\nBULLET::::- \"Introduction to Flight\", John D.

He put an end to the Twenty Years' Anarchy, a period of great instability in the Byzantine Empire between 695 and 717, marked by the rapid succession of several emperors to the throne. He also successfully defended the Empire against the invading Umayyads and forbade the veneration of icons.\n\nLeo, whose original name was Konon, was born in Germanikeia in the Syrian province of Commagene (modern Kahramanmaraş in Turkey). Some, including the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes, have claimed that Konon's family had been resettled in Thrace, where he entered the service of Emperor Justinian II, when the latter was advancing on Constantinople with an army of loyalist followers, and horsemen provided by Tervel of Bulgaria in 705.\n\nAfter the victory of Justinian II, Konon was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to Alania and Lazica to organize an alliance against the Umayyad Caliphate under Al-Walid I. According to the Chronicle of Theophanes Justinian wanted to get rid of Konon and took back the money that had been given to him to help advance Byzantine interests, thus leaving Konon stranded in Alania. The chronicle describes the mission as successful and Konon returning eventually to Justinian after crossing the Caucasus mountains in May with snowshoes and taking the fortress of Sideron (associated with Tsebelda) on the way.\n\nKonon was appointed commander (\"stratēgos\") of the Anatolic theme by Emperor Anastasius II. On his deposition, Konon joined with his colleague Artabasdus, the \"stratēgos\" of the Armeniac theme, in conspiring to overthrow the new Emperor Theodosius III. Artabasdus was betrothed to Anna,\ndaughter of Leo as part of the agreement.\n\nLeo entered Constantinople on 25 March 717 and forced the abdication of Theodosios III, becoming emperor as Leo III. The new Emperor was immediately forced to attend to the Second Arab siege of Constantinople, which commenced in August of the same year. The Arabs were Umayyad forces sent by Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik and serving under his brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. They had taken advantage of the civil discord in the Byzantine Empire to bring a force of 80,000 to 150,000 men and a massive fleet to the Bosphorus.\n\nCareful preparations, begun three years earlier under Anastasius II, and the stubborn resistance put up by Leo wore out the invaders. An important factor in the victory of the Byzantines was their use of Greek fire. The Arab forces also fell victim to Bulgarian reinforcements arriving to aid the Byzantines. Leo was allied with the Bulgarians but the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor was uncertain if they were still serving under Tervel of Bulgaria or his eventual successor Kormesiy of Bulgaria.\n\nUnable to continue the siege in the face of the Bulgarian onslaught, the impenetrability of Constantinople's walls, and their own exhausted provisions, the Arabs were forced to abandon the siege in August, 718. Sulayman himself had died the previous year and his successor Umar II would not attempt another siege. The siege had lasted 12 months.\n\nHaving thus preserved the Empire from extinction, Leo proceeded to consolidate its administration, which in the previous years of anarchy had become completely disorganized. In 718 he suppressed a rebellion in Sicily and in 719 did the same on behalf of the deposed Emperor Anastasios II.\n\nLeo secured the Empire's frontiers by inviting Slavic settlers into the depopulated districts and by restoring the army to efficiency; when the Umayyad Caliphate renewed its invasions in 726 and 739, as part of the campaigns of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, the Arab forces were decisively beaten, particularly at Akroinon in 740. His military efforts were supplemented by his alliances with the Khazars and the Georgians.\n\nLeo undertook a set of civil reforms including the abolition of the system of prepaying taxes which had weighed heavily upon the wealthier proprietors, the elevation of the serfs into a class of free tenants and the remodelling of Family law, maritime law and criminal law, notably substituting mutilation for the death penalty in many cases. The new measures, which were embodied in a new code called the \"Ecloga\" (\"Selection\"), published in 726, met with some opposition on the part of the nobles and higher clergy. The Emperor also undertook some reorganization of the theme structure by creating new themata in the Aegean region.\n\nLeo's most striking legislative reforms dealt with religious matters, especially iconoclasm (\"icon-breaking,\" therefore an iconoclast is an \"icon-breaker\"). After an apparently successful attempt to enforce the baptism of all Jews and Montanists in the empire (722), he issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images (726–729). This prohibition of a custom, which had been in use among Christians for centuries, may have been inspired by Islamic influence as well as the desire to appease those who had not been Christians, and received the support of the official aristocracy. A majority of the theologians and all the monks opposed these measures with uncompromising hostility, and in the western parts of the Empire the people refused to obey the edict.\n\nA revolt which broke out in Greece, mainly on religious grounds, was crushed by the imperial fleet in 727 (cf. Agallianos Kontoskeles). In 730, Patriarch Germanos I of Constantinople resigned rather than subscribe to an iconoclastic decree. Leo had him replaced by Anastasios, who willingly sided with the Emperor on the question of icons. Thus Leo suppressed the overt opposition of the capital.\n\nIn the Italian Peninsula, the defiant attitude of Popes Gregory II and later Gregory III on behalf of image-veneration led to a fierce quarrel with the Emperor. The former summoned councils in Rome to anathematize and excommunicate the iconoclasts (730, 732); in 740 Leo retaliated by transferring Southern Italy and Illyricum from the papal diocese to that of the Patriarch of Constantinople. The struggle was accompanied by an armed outbreak in the exarchate of Ravenna in 727, which Leo finally endeavoured to subdue by means of a large fleet. But the destruction of the armament by a storm decided the issue against him; his southern Italian subjects successfully defied his religious edicts, and the Exarchate of Ravenna became effectively detached from the Empire.\n\nScholars have discussed the mutual influence of Muslim and Byzantine iconoclasm, noting that Caliph Yazid II had issued an iconoclastic edict, also targeting his Christian subjects, already in 721.\n\nThe emperor died of dropsy in June 741.\n\nWith his wife Maria, Leo III had four known children:\nBULLET::::- Anna, who married Artabasdus.\nBULLET::::- Constantine V, who succeeded as emperor.\nBULLET::::- Irene\nBULLET::::- Kosmo\n\nBULLET::::- List of Byzantine emperors\n\nBULLET::::- Entry of \"Leo III\" in \"The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium\", ed.

{"id": "18011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18011", "title": "Lombards", "text": "Lombards\n\nThe Lombards () or Longobards () were a Germanic people who ruled most of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774.\n\nThe Lombard historian Paul the Deacon wrote in the \"Historia Langobardorum\" that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the Winnili, who dwelt in southern Scandinavia (\"Scadanan\") before migrating to seek new lands. In the 1st century AD, they formed part of the Suebi, in north-western Germany. By the end of the 5th century, they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern Austria and Slovakia north of the Danube river, where they subdued the Heruls and later fought frequent wars with the Gepids. The Lombard king Audoin defeated the Gepid leader Thurisind in 551 or 552; his successor Alboin eventually destroyed the Gepids in 567.\n\nFollowing this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long Gothic War (535–554) between the Byzantine Empire and the Ostrogothic Kingdom there. In contrast with the Goths and the Vandals, the Lombards left Scandinavia and descended south through Germany, Austria and Slovenia, only leaving Germanic territory a few decades before reaching Italy. The Lombards would have consequently remained a predominantly Germanic tribe by the time they invaded Italy. The Lombards were joined by numerous Saxons, Heruls, Gepids, Bulgars, Thuringians, and Ostrogoths, and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all of northern Italy and the principal cities north of the Po River except Pavia, which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in central Italy and southern Italy. They established a Lombard Kingdom in north and central Italy, later named \"Regnum Italicum\" (\"Kingdom of Italy\"), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler Liutprand. In 774, the Kingdom was conquered by the Frankish King Charlemagne and integrated into his Empire. However, Lombard nobles continued to rule southern parts of the Italian peninsula well into the 11th century, when they were conquered by the Normans and added to their County of Sicily. In this period, the southern part of Italy still under Longobardic domination was known to the foreigners by the name Langbarðaland (Land of the Lombards), in the Norse runestones. Their legacy is also apparent in the regional name Lombardy (in the north of Italy).\n\nThe fullest account of Lombard origins, history, and practices is the \"Historia Langobardorum\" (\"History of the Lombards\") of Paul the Deacon, written in the 8th century. Paul's chief source for Lombard origins, however, is the 7th-century \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\" (\"Origin of the Lombard People\").\n\nThe \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\" tells the story of a small tribe called the \"Winnili\" dwelling in southern Scandinavia (\"Scadanan\") (the \"Codex Gothanus\" writes that the Winnili first dwelt near a river called \"Vindilicus\" on the extreme boundary of Gaul). The Winnili were split into three groups and one part left their native land to seek foreign fields. The reason for the exodus was probably overpopulation. The departing people were led by the brothers Ybor and Aio and their mother Gambara and arrived in the lands of \"Scoringa\", perhaps the Baltic coast or the Bardengau on the banks of the Elbe. Scoringa was ruled by the Vandals and their chieftains, the brothers Ambri and Assi, who granted the Winnili a choice between tribute or war.\n\nThe Winnili were young and brave and refused to pay tribute, saying \"It is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute.\" The Vandals prepared for war and consulted Godan (the god Odin), who answered that he would give the victory to those whom he would see first at sunrise. The Winnili were fewer in number and Gambara sought help from Frea (the goddess Frigg), who advised that all Winnili women should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and march in line with their husbands. At sunrise, Frea turned her husband's bed so that he was facing east, and woke him. So Godan spotted the Winnili first and asked, \"Who are these long-beards?,\" and Frea replied, \"My lord, thou hast given them the name, now give them also the victory.\" From that moment onwards, the Winnili were known as the \"Longbeards\" (Latinised as \"Langobardi\", Italianised as \"Longobardi\", and Anglicized as \"Longobards\" or \"Lombards\").\n\nWhen Paul the Deacon wrote the \"Historia\" between 787 and 796 he was a Catholic monk and devoted Christian. He thought the pagan stories of his people \"silly\" and \"laughable\". Paul explained that the name \"Langobard\" came from the length of their beards. A modern theory suggests that the name \"Langobard\" comes from \"Langbarðr\", a name of Odin. Priester states that when the Winnili changed their name to \"Lombards\", they also changed their old agricultural fertility cult to a cult of Odin, thus creating a conscious tribal tradition. Fröhlich inverts the order of events in Priester and states that with the Odin cult, the Lombards grew their beards in resemblance of the Odin of tradition and their new name reflected this. Bruckner remarks that the name of the Lombards stands in close relation to the worship of Odin, whose many names include \"the Long-bearded\" or \"the Grey-bearded\", and that the Lombard given name \"Ansegranus\" (\"he with the beard of the gods\") shows that the Lombards had this idea of their chief deity. The same Old Norse root Barth or Barði, meaning \"beard\", is shared with the Heaðobards mentioned in both \"Beowulf\" and in \"Widsith\", where they are in conflict with the Danes. They were possibly a branch of the Langobards.\n\nAlternatively some etymological sources suggest an Old High German root, barta, meaning “axe” (and related to English halberd), while Edward Gibbon puts forth an alternative suggestion which argues that:\n\n…Börde (or Börd) still signifies “a fertile plain by the side of a river,” and a district near Magdeburg is still called the lange Börde. According to this view Langobardi would signify “inhabitants of the long bord of the river;” and traces of their name are supposed still to occur in such names as Bardengau and Bardewick in the neighborhood of the Elbe.\n\nAccording to the Gallaecian Christian priest, historian and theologian Paulus Orosius, the Lombards or Winnili lived originally in the Vinuiloth (Vinovilith) mentioned by Jordanes, in his masterpiece Getica, to the north of Uppsala, Sweden. Scoringa was near the province of Uppland, so just north of Östergötland.\n\nThe historian then explains the etymology of the name Scoringa:\n\nThe shores of Uppland and Östergötland are covered with small rocks and rocky islands, which are called in German Schæren and in Swedish Skiaeren. Heal signifies a port in the northern languages; consequently Skiæren-Heal is the port of the Skiæren, a name well adapted to the port of Stockholm, in the Upplandske Skiæren, and the country may be justly called Scorung or Skiærunga.\n\nThe legendary king Sceafa of Scandza was an ancient Lombardic king in Anglo-Saxon legend. The Old English poem Widsith, in a listing of famous kings and their countries, has Sceafa [weold] Longbeardum, so naming Sceafa as ruler of the Lombards.\n\nSimilarities between Langobardic and Gothic migration traditions have been noted among scholars. These early migration legends suggest that a major shifting of tribes occurred sometime between the 1st and 2nd century BC, which would coincide with the time that the Teutoni and Cimbri left their homelands in Scandinavia and migrated through Germany, eventually invading Roman Italy.\n\nThe first mention of the Lombards occurred between AD 9 and 16, by the Roman court historian Velleius Paterculus, who accompanied a Roman expedition as prefect of the cavalry. Paterculus says that under Tiberius the \"power of the Langobardi was broken, a race surpassing even the Germans in savagery\".\n\nFrom the combined testimony of Strabo (AD 20) and Tacitus (AD 117), the Lombards dwelt near the mouth of the Elbe shortly after the beginning of the Christian era, next to the Chauci. Strabo states that the Lombards dwelt on both sides of the Elbe. He treats them as a branch of the Suebi, and states that:\n\nNow as for the tribe of the Suebi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis; and a part of them even dwell on the far side of the Albis, as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at least, have, to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river.\n\nSuetonius wrote that Roman general Nero Drusus defeated a large force of Germans and drove some “to the farther side of the Albis (Elbe)” river. It is conceivable that these refugees were the Langobardi and the Hermunduri mentioned by Strabo not long after.\n\nThe German archaeologist Willi Wegewitz defined several Iron Age burial sites at the Lower Elbe as \"Langobardic\". The burial sites are crematorial and are usually dated from the 6th century BC through the 3rd century AD, so a settlement breakoff seems unlikely. The lands of the lower Elbe fall into the zone of the Jastorf Culture and became Elbe-Germanic, differing from the lands between Rhine, Weser, and the North Sea. Archaeological finds show that the Lombards were an agricultural people.\n\nTacitus also counted the Lombards as a remote and aggressive Suebian tribe, one of those united in worship of the deity Nerthus, who he referred to as \"Mother Earth\", and also as subjects of Marobod the King of the Marcomanni. Marobod had made peace with the Romans, and that is why the Lombards were not part of the Germanic confederacy under Arminius at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9. In AD 17, war broke out between Arminius and Marobod. Tacitus records:\n\nIn 47, a struggle ensued amongst the Cherusci and they expelled their new leader, the nephew of Arminius, from their country. The Lombards appeared on the scene with sufficient power to control the destiny of the tribe that had been the leader in the struggle for independence thirty-eight years earlier, for they restored the deposed leader to sovereignty.\n\nTo the south, Cassius Dio reported that just before the Marcomannic Wars, 6,000 Lombards and Obii (sometimes thought to be Ubii), crossed the Danube and invaded Pannonia. The two tribes were defeated, whereupon they ceased their invasion and sent Ballomar, King of the Marcomanni, as ambassador to Aelius Bassus, who was then administering Pannonia. Peace was made and the two tribes returned to their homes, which in the case of the Lombards was the lands of the lower Elbe. At about this time, in his \"Germania\" Tacitus says that \"their scanty numbers are a distinction\" because \"surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes, they are safe, not by submitting, but by daring the perils of war\".\n\nIn the mid-2nd century, the Lombards apparently appeared in the Rhineland, because according to Claudius Ptolemy, the Suebic Lombards lived \"below\" the Bructeri and Sugambri, and between these and the Tencteri. To their east stretching northwards to the central Elbe are the Suebi Angili. But Ptolemy also mentions the \"Laccobardi\" to the north of the above-mentioned Suebic territories, east of the Angrivarii on the Weser, and south of the Chauci on the coast, probably indicating a Lombard expansion from the Elbe to the Rhine. This double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Schütte, in his analysis of Ptolemy. However, the \"Codex Gothanus\" also mentions \"Patespruna\" (Paderborn) in connection with the Lombards.\n\nFrom the 2nd century onwards, many of the Germanic tribes recorded as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the Franks, Alamanni, Bavarii, and Saxons. The Lombards are not mentioned at first, perhaps because they were not initially on the border of Rome, or perhaps because they were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons. It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards. However, the \"Codex Gothanus\" states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years. In the second half of the 4th century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.\n\nThe migration route of the Lombards in 489, from their homeland to \"Rugiland\", encompassed several places: \"Scoringa\" (believed to be their land on the Elbe shores), \"Mauringa\", \"Golanda\", \"Anthaib\", \"Banthaib\", and \"Vurgundaib\" (\"Burgundaib\"). According to the Ravenna Cosmography, Mauringa was the land east of the Elbe.\n\nThe crossing into Mauringa was very difficult. The Assipitti (possibly the Usipetes) denied them passage through their lands and a fight was arranged for the strongest man of each tribe. The Lombard was victorious, passage was granted, and the Lombards reached Mauringa.\n\nThe Lombards departed from Mauringa and reached Golanda. Scholar Ludwig Schmidt thinks this was further east, perhaps on the right bank of the Oder. Schmidt considers the name the equivalent of Gotland, meaning simply \"good land.\" This theory is highly plausible; Paul the Deacon mentions the Lombards crossing a river, and they could have reached \"Rugiland\" from the Upper Oder area via the Moravian Gate.\n\nMoving out of Golanda, the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib, believed to be the old lands of the Burgundes. In Vurgundaib, the Lombards were stormed in camp by \"Bulgars\" (probably Huns) and were defeated; King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king. He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund. The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter, gaining great booty and confidence as they \"became bolder in undertaking the toils of war.\"\n\nIn the 540s, Audoin (ruled 546–560) led the Lombards across the Danube once more into Pannonia, where they received Imperial subsidies as Justinian encouraged them to battle the Gepids. In 552, the Byzantines, aided by a large contingent of Foederati, notably Lombards, Heruls and Bulgars, defeated the last Ostrogoths led by Teia in the Battle of Taginae.\n\nIn approximately 560, Audoin was succeeded by his son Alboin, a young and energetic leader who defeated the neighboring Gepidae and made them his subjects; in 566, he married Rosamund, daughter of the Gepid king Cunimund. In the spring of 568, Alboin led the Lombard migration into Italy. According to the \"History of the Lombards,\" \"Then the Langobards, having left Pannonia, hastened to take possession of Italy with their wives and children and all their goods.\"\n\nVarious other peoples who either voluntarily joined or were subjects of King Alboin were also part of the migration. \"Whence, even until today, we call the villages in which they dwell Gepidan, Bulgarian, Sarmatian, Pannonian, Suabian, Norican, or by other names of this kind.\" At least 20,000 Saxon warriors, old allies of the Lombards, and their families joined them in their new migration.\n\nThe first important city to fall was \"Forum Iulii\" (Cividale del Friuli) in northeastern Italy, in 569. There, Alboin created the first Lombard duchy, which he entrusted to his nephew Gisulf. Soon Vicenza, Verona and Brescia fell into Germanic hands. In the summer of 569, the Lombards conquered the main Roman centre of northern Italy, Milan. The area was then recovering from the terrible Gothic Wars, and the small Byzantine army left for its defence could do almost nothing. Longinus, the Exarch sent to Italy by Emperor Justin II, could only defend coastal cities that could be supplied by the powerful Byzantine fleet. Pavia fell after a siege of three years, in 572, becoming the first capital city of the new Lombard kingdom of Italy.\n\nIn the following years, the Lombards penetrated further south, conquering Tuscany and establishing two duchies, Spoleto and Benevento under Zotto, which soon became semi-independent and even outlasted the northern kingdom, surviving well into the 12th century. Wherever they went, they were joined by the Ostrogothic population, which was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. The Byzantines managed to retain control of the area of Ravenna and Rome, linked by a thin corridor running through Perugia.\n\nWhen they entered Italy, some Lombards retained their native form of paganism, while some were Arian Christians. Hence they did not enjoy good relations with the Early Christian Church. Gradually, they adopted Roman or Romanized titles, names, and traditions, and partially converted to orthodoxy (in the 7th century), though not without a long series of religious and ethnic conflicts. By the time Paul the Deacon was writing, the Lombard language, dress and even hairstyles had nearly all disappeared \"in toto\".\n\nThe whole Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies, whose leaders settled in the main cities. The king ruled over them and administered the land through emissaries called \"gastaldi\". This subdivision, however, together with the independent indocility of the duchies, deprived the kingdom of unity, making it weak even when compared to the Byzantines, especially since these had begun to recover from the initial invasion. This weakness became even more evident when the Lombards had to face the increasing power of the Franks. In response, the kings tried to centralize power over time, but they definitively lost control over Spoleto and Benevento in the attempt.\n\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Friuli\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Trent\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Persiceta\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Pavia\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Tuscia\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Spoleto and List of Dukes of Spoleto\nBULLET::::- Duchy of Benevento and List of Dukes and Princes of Benevento\n\nIn 572, Alboin was murdered in Verona in a plot led by his wife, Rosamund, who later fled to Ravenna. His successor, Cleph, was also assassinated, after a ruthless reign of 18 months. His death began an interregnum of years (the \"Rule of the Dukes\") during which the dukes did not elect any king, a period regarded as a time of violence and disorder. In 586, threatened by a Frankish invasion, the dukes elected Cleph's son, Authari, as king. In 589, he married Theodelinda, daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria, the Duke of Bavaria. The Catholic Theodelinda was a friend of Pope Gregory I and pushed for Christianization. In the meantime, Authari embarked on a policy of internal reconciliation and tried to reorganize royal administration. The dukes yielded half their estates for the maintenance of the king and his court in Pavia. On the foreign affairs side, Authari managed to thwart the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks.\n\nAuthari died in 591 and was succeeded by Agilulf, the duke of Turin, who also married Theodelinda in the same year. Agilulf successfully fought the rebel dukes of northern Italy, conquering Padua in 601, Cremona and Mantua in 603, and forcing the Exarch of Ravenna to pay tribute. Agilulf died in 616; Theodelinda reigned alone until 628 when she was succeeded by Adaloald. Arioald, the head of the Arian opposition who had married Theodelinda's daughter Gundeperga, later deposed Adaloald.\n\nArioald was succeeded by Rothari, regarded by many authorities as the most energetic of all Lombard kings. He extended his dominions, conquering Liguria in 643 and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of inner Veneto, including the Roman city of \"Opitergium\" (Oderzo). Rothari also made the famous edict bearing his name, the \"Edictum Rothari\", which established the laws and the customs of his people in Latin: the edict did not apply to the tributaries of the Lombards, who could retain their own laws. Rothari's son Rodoald succeeded him in 652, still very young, and was killed by his opponents.\n\nAt the death of King Aripert I in 661, the kingdom was split between his children Perctarit, who set his capital in Milan, and Godepert, who reigned from Pavia (Ticinum). Perctarit was overthrown by Grimoald, son of Gisulf, duke of Friuli and Benevento since 647. Perctarit fled to the Avars and then to the Franks. Grimoald managed to regain control over the duchies and deflected the late attempt of the Byzantine emperor Constans II to conquer southern Italy. He also defeated the Franks. At Grimoald's death in 671 Perctarit returned and promoted tolerance between Arians and Catholics, but he could not defeat the Arian party, led by Arachi, duke of Trento, who submitted only to his son, the philo-Catholic Cunincpert.\n\nThe Lombards engaged in fierce battles with Slavic peoples during these years: from 623–26 the Lombards unsuccessfully attacked the Carantanians, and, in 663–64, the Slavs raided the Vipava Valley and the Friuli.\n\nReligious strife and the Slavic raids remained a source of struggle in the following years. In 705, the Friuli Lombards were defeated and lost the land to the west of the Soča River, namely the Gorizia Hills and the Venetian Slovenia. A new ethnic border was established that has lasted for over 1200 years up until the present time.\n\nThe Lombard reign began to recover only with Liutprand the Lombard (king from 712), son of Ansprand and successor of the brutal Aripert II. He managed to regain a certain control over Spoleto and Benevento, and, taking advantage of the disagreements between the Pope and Byzantium concerning the reverence of icons, he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of Rome. He also helped the Frankish marshal Charles Martel drive back the Arabs. The Slavs were defeated in the Battle of Lavariano, when they tried to conquer the Friulian Plain in 720. Liutprand's successor Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish it when he was subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks, Pippin III, who was called by the Pope.\n\nAfter the death of Aistulf, Ratchis attempted to become king of Lombardy, but he was deposed by Desiderius, duke of Tuscany, the last Lombard to rule as king. Desiderius managed to take Ravenna definitively, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy. He decided to reopen struggles against the Pope, who was supporting the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against him, and entered Rome in 772, the first Lombard king to do so. But when Pope Hadrian I called for help from the powerful Frankish king Charlemagne, Desiderius was defeated at Susa and besieged in Pavia, while his son Adelchis was forced to open the gates of Verona to Frankish troops. Desiderius surrendered in 774, and Charlemagne, in an utterly novel decision, took the title \"King of the Lombards\". Before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people. Charlemagne took part of the Lombard territory to create the Papal States.\n\nThe Lombardy region in Italy, which includes the cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Milan, and the old capital Pavia, is a reminder of the presence of the Lombards.\n\nThough the kingdom centred on Pavia in the north fell to Charlemagne and the Franks in 774, the Lombard-controlled territory to the south of the Papal States was never subjugated by Charlemagne or his descendants. In 774, Duke Arechis II of Benevento, whose duchy had only nominally been under royal authority, though certain kings had been effective at making their power known in the south, claimed that Benevento was the successor state of the kingdom. He tried to turn Benevento into a \"secundum Ticinum\": a second Pavia. He tried to claim the kingship, but with no support and no chance of a coronation in Pavia.\n\nCharlemagne came down with an army, and his son Louis the Pious sent men, to force the Beneventan duke to submit, but his submission and promises were never kept and Arechis and his successors were \"de facto\" independent. The Beneventan dukes took the title \"prínceps\" (prince) instead of that of king.\n\nThe Lombards of southern Italy were thereafter in the anomalous position of holding land claimed by two empires: the Carolingian Empire to the north and west and the Byzantine Empire to the east. They typically made pledges and promises of tribute to the Carolingians, but effectively remained outside Frankish control. Benevento meanwhile grew to its greatest extent yet when it imposed a tribute on the Duchy of Naples, which was tenuously loyal to Byzantium and even conquered the Neapolitan city of Amalfi in 838. At one point in the reign of Sicard, Lombard control covered most of southern Italy save the very south of Apulia and Calabria and Naples, with its nominally attached cities. It was during the 9th century that a strong Lombard presence became entrenched in formerly Greek Apulia. However, Sicard had opened up the south to the invasive actions of the Saracens in his war with Andrew II of Naples and when he was assassinated in 839, Amalfi declared independence and two factions fought for power in Benevento, crippling the principality and making it susceptible to external enemies.\n\nThe civil war lasted ten years and ended with a peace treaty imposed in 849 by Emperor Louis II, the only Frankish king to exercise actual sovereignty over the Lombard states. The treaty divided the kingdom into two states: the Principality of Benevento and the Principality of Salerno, with its capital at Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nAndrew II of Naples hired Islamic mercenaries and formed a Muslim-Christian alliance for his war with Sicard of Benevento in 836; Sicard responded with other Muslim mercenaries. The Saracens initially concentrated their attacks on Sicily and Byzantine Italy, but soon Radelchis I of Benevento called in more mercenaries, who destroyed Capua in 841. Landulf the Old founded the present-day Capua, \"New Capua\", on a nearby hill. In general, the Lombard princes were less inclined to ally with the Saracens than with their Greek neighbours of Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, and Sorrento. Guaifer of Salerno, however, briefly put himself under Muslim suzerainty.\n\nIn 847 a large Muslim force seized Bari, until then a Lombard gastaldate under the control of Pandenulf. Saracen incursions proceeded northwards until Adelchis of Benevento sought the help of his suzerain, Louis II, who allied with the Byzantine emperor Basil I to expel the Arabs from Bari in 869. An Arab landing force was defeated by the emperor in 871. Adelchis and Louis remained at war until the death of Louis in 875. Adelchis regarded himself as the true successor of the Lombard kings, and in that capacity he amended the \"Edictum Rothari\", the last Lombard ruler to do so.\n\nAfter the death of Louis, Landulf II of Capua briefly flirted with a Saracen alliance, but Pope John VIII convinced him to break it off. Guaimar I of Salerno fought the Saracens with Byzantine troops. Throughout this period the Lombard princes swung in allegiance from one party to another. Finally, towards 915, Pope John X managed to unite the Christian princes of southern Italy against the Saracen establishments on the Garigliano river. The Saracens were ousted from Italy in the Battle of the Garigliano in 915.\n\nThe independent state of Salerno inspired the gastalds of Capua to move towards independence, and by the end of the century they were styling themselves \"princes\" and as a third Lombard state. The Capuan and Beneventan states were united by Atenulf I of Capua in 900. He subsequently declared them to be in perpetual union, and they were separated only in 982, on the death of Pandulf Ironhead. With all of the Lombard south under his control, except Salerno, Atenulf felt safe to use the title \"Princeps Gentis Langobardorum\" (\"prince of the Lombard people\"), which Arechis II had begun using in 774. Among Atenulf's successors the principality was ruled jointly by fathers, sons, brothers, cousins, and uncles for the greater part of the century. Meanwhile, the prince Gisulf I of Salerno began using the title \"Langobardorum Gentis Princeps\" around mid-century, but the ideal of a united Lombard principality was realised only in December 977, when Gisulf died and his domains were inherited by Pandulf Ironhead, who temporarily held almost all Italy south of Rome and brought the Lombards into alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. His territories were divided upon his death.\n\nLandulf the Red of Benevento and Capua tried to conquer the principality of Salerno with the help of John III of Naples, but with the aid of Mastalus I of Amalfi, Gisulf repulsed him. The rulers of Benevento and Capua made several attempts on Byzantine Apulia at this time, but late in the century, the Byzantines, under the stiff rule of Basil II, gained ground on the Lombards.\n\nThe principal source for the history of the Lombard principalities in this period is the \"Chronicon Salernitanum\", composed late in the 10th century at Salerno.\n\nThe diminished Beneventan principality soon lost its independence to the papacy and declined in importance until it fell in the Norman conquest of southern Italy. The Normans, first called in by the Lombards to fight the Byzantines for control of Apulia and Calabria (under the likes of Melus of Bari and Arduin, among others), had become rivals for hegemony in the south. The Salernitan principality experienced a golden age under Guaimar III and Guaimar IV, but under Gisulf II, the principality shrank to insignificance and fell in 1078 to Robert Guiscard, who had married Gisulf's sister Sichelgaita. The Capua principality was hotly contested during the reign of the hated Pandulf IV, the \"Wolf of the Abruzzi\", and, under his son, it fell, almost without contest, to the Norman Richard Drengot (1058). The Capuans revolted against Norman rule in 1091, expelling Richard's grandson Richard II and setting up one Lando IV.\n\nCapua was again put under Norman rule after the Siege of Capua of 1098 and the city quickly declined in importance under a series of ineffectual Norman rulers. The independent status of these Lombard states is in general attested by the ability of their rulers to switch suzerains at will. Often the legal vassal of pope or emperor (either Byzantine or Holy Roman), they were the real power-brokers in the south until their erstwhile allies, the Normans, rose to preeminence: The Lombards regarded the Normans as barbarians and the Byzantines as oppressors. Regarding their own civilisation as superior, the Lombards did indeed provide the environment for the illustrious Schola Medica Salernitana.\n\nThe Lombardic language is extinct (unless Cimbrian and Mocheno represent surviving dialects). The Germanic language declined, beginning in the 7th century, but may have been in scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. Only fragments of the language have survived, the main evidence being individual words quoted in Latin texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the language's morphology and syntax. The genetic classification of the language depends entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the High German consonant shift, it is usually classified as an Elbe Germanic or Upper German dialect.\n\nLombardic fragments are preserved in runic inscriptions. Primary source texts include short inscriptions in the Elder Futhark, among them the \"bronze capsule of Schretzheim\" (c. 600) and the silver belt buckle found in Pforzen, Ostallgäu (Schwaben). A number of Latin texts include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular. In 2005, Emilia Denčeva argued that the inscription of the Pernik sword may be Lombardic.\n\nThe Italian language preserves a large number of Lombardic words, although it is not always easy to distinguish them from other Germanic borrowings such as those from Gothic or from Frankish. They often bear some resemblance to English words, as Lombardic was akin to Old Saxon. For instance, \"landa\" from \"land\", \"guardia\" from \"wardan\" (warden), \"guerra\" from \"werra\" (war), \"ricco\" from \"rikki\" (rich), and \"guadare\" from \"wadjan\" (to wade).\n\nFrom the \"Codice diplomatico longobardo\", a collection of legal documents that makes reference to many Lombardic terms, we obtain several terms still in use in the Italian language:\n\n\"barba\" (beard), \"marchio\" (mark), \"maniscalco\" (blacksmith), \"aia\" (courtyard), \"braida\" (suburban meadow), \"borgo\" (burg, village), \"fara\" (fundamental unity of Lombard social and military organization, presently used as toponym), \"pizzo\" (peak, mountain top, now used as toponym), \"sala\" (hall, room, also used as toponym), \"staffa\" (stirrup), \"stalla\" (stable), \"sculdascio\", \"faida\" (feud), \"manigoldo\" (scoundrel), \"sgherro\" (henchman); \"fanone\" (baleen), \"stamberga\" (hovel); \"anca\" (hip), \"guancia\" (cheek), \"nocca\" (knuckle), \"schiena\" (back); \"gazza\" (magpie), \"martora\" (marten); \"gualdo\" (wood, presently used as toponym), \"pozza\" (pool); verbs like \"bussare\" (to knock), \"piluccare\" (to peck), \"russare\" (to snore).\n\nDuring their stay at the mouth of the Elbe, the Lombards came into contact with other western Germanic populations, such as the Saxons and the Frisians. From these populations, which for long had been in contact with the Celts (especially the Saxons), they learned a rigid social organization into castes, rarely present in other Germanic peoples.\n\nThe Lombard kings can be traced back as early as c. 380 and thus to the beginning of the Great Migration. Kingship developed amongst the Germanic peoples when the unity of a single military command was found necessary. Schmidt believed that the Germanic tribes were divided according to cantons and that the earliest government was a general assembly that selected canton chiefs and war leaders in times of conflict. All such figures were probably selected from a caste of nobility. As a result of the wars of their wanderings, royal power developed such that the king became the representative of the people, but the influence of the people on the government did not fully disappear. Paul the Deacon gives an account of the Lombard tribal structure during the migration:\n\n. . . in order that they might increase the number of their warriors, [the Lombards] confer liberty upon many whom they deliver from the yoke of bondage, and that the freedom of these may be regarded as established, they confirm it in their accustomed way by an arrow, uttering certain words of their country in confirmation of the fact.\n\nComplete emancipation appears to have been granted only among the Franks and the Lombards.\n\nLombard society was divided into classes comparable to those found in the other Germanic successor states of Rome, Frankish Gaul and Visigothic Spain. There was a noble class, a class of free persons beneath them, a class of unfree non-slaves (serfs), and finally slaves. The aristocracy itself was poorer, more urbanised, and less landed than elsewhere. Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself, Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities (unlike their Frankish counterparts) and hold little more than twice as much in land as the merchant class (a far cry from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land, hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status). The aristocracy by the 8th century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties: many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as \"iudices\" (judges) even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well.\n\nThe freemen of the Lombard kingdom were far more numerous than in Frank lands, especially in the 8th century, when they are almost invisible in surviving documentary evidence. Smallholders, owner-cultivators, and rentiers are the most numerous types of person in surviving diplomata for the Lombard kingdom. They may have owned more than half of the land in Lombard Italy. The freemen were \"exercitales\" and \"viri devoti\", that is, soldiers and \"devoted men\" (a military term like \"retainers\"); they formed the levy of the Lombard army, and they were sometimes, if infrequently, called to serve, though this seems not to have been their preference. The small landed class, however, lacked the political influence necessary with the king (and the dukes) to control the politics and legislation of the kingdom. The aristocracy was more thoroughly powerful politically if not economically in Italy than in contemporary Gaul and Spain.\n\nThe urbanisation of Lombard Italy was characterised by the \"città ad isole\" (or \"city as islands\"). It appears from archaeology that the great cities of Lombard Italy — Pavia, Lucca, Siena, Arezzo, Milan — were themselves formed of minute islands of urbanisation within the old Roman city walls. The cities of the Roman Empire had been partially destroyed in the series of wars of the 5th and 6th centuries. Many sectors were left in ruins and ancient monuments became fields of grass used as pastures for animals, thus the Roman Forum became the \"Campo Vaccino\", the field of cows. The portions of the cities that remained intact were small, modest, contained a cathedral or major church (often sumptuously decorated), and a few public buildings and townhomes of the aristocracy. Few buildings of importance were stone, most were wood. In the end, the inhabited parts of the cities were separated from one another by stretches of pasture even within the city walls.\n\nBULLET::::- Lombard state on the Carpathians (6th century)\nBULLET::::- Lombard state in Pannonia (6th century)\nBULLET::::- Kingdom of Italy and List of Kings of the Lombards\nBULLET::::- Principality of Benevento and List of Dukes and Princes of Benevento\nBULLET::::- Principality of Salerno and List of Princes of Salerno\nBULLET::::- Principality of Capua and List of Princes of Capua\n\nThe legend from Origo may hint that initially, before the passage from Scandinavia to the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the Lombards worshiped the Vanir. Later, in contact with other Germanic populations, they adopted the worship of the Æsir: an evolution that marked the passage from the adoration of deities related to fertility and the earth to the cult of warlike gods.\n\nIn chapter 40 of his Germania, Roman historian Tacitus, discussing the Suebian tribes of Germania, writes that the Lombards were one of the Suebian tribes united in worship of the deity Nerthus, who is often identified with the Norse goddess Freyja. The other tribes were the Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarines and Nuitones.\n\nSt. Barbatus of Benevento observed many pagan rituals and traditions amongst the Lombards authorised by the Duke Romuald, son of King Grimoald:<BR>\n\nThe Lombards were first touched by Christianity while still in Pannonia, but only touched: their conversion and Christianisation was largely nominal and far from complete. During the reign of Wacho, they were Orthodox Catholics allied with the Byzantine Empire, but Alboin converted to Arianism as an ally of the Ostrogoths and invaded Italy. All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy, while the common people remained pagan.\n\nIn Italy, the Lombards were intensively Christianised, and the pressure to convert to Catholicism was great. With the Bavarian queen Theodelinda, a Catholic, the monarchy was brought under heavy Catholic influence. After initial support for the anti-Rome party in the Schism of the Three Chapters, Theodelinda remained a close contact and supporter of Pope Gregory I. In 603, Adaloald, the heir to the throne, received Catholic baptism. During the next century, Arianism and paganism continued to hold out in Austria (the northeast of Italy) and in the Duchy of Benevento. A succession of Arian kings was militarily aggressive and presented a threat to the Papacy in Rome. In the 7th century, the nominally Christian aristocracy of Benevento was still practising pagan rituals such as sacrifices in \"sacred\" woods. By the end of the reign of Cunincpert, however, the Lombards were more or less completely Catholicised. Under Liutprand Catholicism became tangible as the king sought to justify his title \"rex totius Italiae\" by uniting the south of the peninsula with the north, thereby bringing together his Italo-Roman and Germanic subjects into one Catholic State.\n\nThe Duchy and eventually Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian rite in the 7th and 8th centuries. The Beneventan rite is more closely related to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than to the Roman rite. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite.\n\nCharacteristic of this rite was the Beneventan chant, a Lombard-influenced chant that bore similarities to the Ambrosian chant of Milan. The Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite; many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks, appearing variously as antiphons, offertories, and communions, for example. It was eventually supplanted by the Gregorian chant in the 11th century.\n\nThe chief centre of the Beneventan chant was Montecassino, one of the first and greatest abbeys of Western monasticism. Gisulf II of Benevento had donated a large swathe of land to Montecassino in 744, and that became the basis for an important state, the \"Terra Sancti Benedicti\", which was a subject only to Rome. The Cassinese influence on Christianity in southern Italy was immense. Montecassino was also the starting point for another characteristic of Beneventan monasticism, the use of the distinct Beneventan script, a clear, angular script derived from the Roman cursive as used by the Lombards.\n\nDuring their nomadic phase, the Lombards primarily created art that was easily carried with them, like arms and jewellery. Though relatively little of this has survived, it bears resemblance to the similar endeavours of other Germanic tribes of northern and central Europe from the same era.\n\nThe first major modifications to the Germanic style of the Lombards came in Pannonia and especially in Italy, under the influence of local, Byzantine, and Christian styles. The conversions from nomadism and paganism to settlement and Christianity also opened up new arenas of artistic expression, such as architecture (especially churches) and its accompanying decorative arts (such as frescoes).\n\nFew Lombard buildings have survived. Most have been lost, rebuilt, or renovated at some point, so they preserve little of their original Lombard structure. Lombard architecture was well-studied in the 20th century, and the four-volume \"Lombard Architecture\" (1919) by Arthur Kingsley Porter is a \"monument of illustrated history\".\n\nThe small Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle in Cividale del Friuli is probably one of the oldest preserved examples of Lombard architecture, as Cividale was the first Lombard city in Italy. Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in Pavia (San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, crypts of Sant'Eusebio and San Giovanni Domnarum) and Monza (cathedral). The \"Basilic autariana\" in Fara Gera d'Adda near Bergamo and the church of San Salvatore in Brescia also have Lombard elements. All these buildings are in northern Italy (Langobardia major), but by far the best-preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy (Langobardia minor). The Church of Santa Sofia in Benevento was erected in 760 by Duke Arechis II, and it preserves Lombard frescoes on the walls and even Lombard capitals on the columns.\n\nLombard architecture flourished under the impulse provided by the Catholic monarchs like Theodelinda, Liutprand, and Desiderius to the foundation of monasteries to further their political control. Bobbio Abbey was founded during this time.\n\nSome of the late Lombard structures of the 9th and 10th centuries have been found to contain elements of style associated with Romanesque architecture and have been so dubbed \"first Romanesque\". These edifices are considered, along with some similar buildings in southern France and Catalonia, to mark a transitory phase between the Pre-Romanesque and full-fledged Romanesque.\n\nBULLET::::- Notes\nBULLET::::- Bibliography\nBULLET::::- \"Cosmographer of Ravenna\"\nBULLET::::- \"Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani\" in \"Codex Gothanus\"\nBULLET::::- \"Historia Langobardorum\"\nBULLET::::- \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\"\nBULLET::::- (1868). \"Die Gens Langobardorum und ihre Herkunft, ...und ihre Sprache\".

{"id": "18013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18013", "title": "Loki", "text": "Loki\n\nLoki (, , ) is a god in Norse mythology. Loki is in some sources the son of Fárbauti and Laufey, and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr. By his wife Sigyn, Loki is the father of Narfi and/or Nari. By the stallion Svaðilfari, Loki is the mother—giving birth in the form of a mare—to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of Váli in \"Prose Edda\", though this source also refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice, and Váli is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a shape shifter and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a salmon, a mare, a fly, and possibly an elderly woman named Þökk (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god Baldr and Loki is eventually bound by Váli with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Prose Edda\", the goddess Skaði is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of Ragnarök, Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the jötnar, at which time he will encounter the god Heimdallr and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the \"Prose Edda\" and \"Heimskringla\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; the Norwegian Rune Poems, in the poetry of skalds, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the Snaptun Stone, the Kirkby Stephen Stone, and the Gosforth Cross. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a trickster god, have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\nThe etymology of the name \"Loki\" has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word \"logi\" ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese \"Lokki\", Danish \"Lokkemand\", Norwegian \"Loke\" and \"Lokke\", Swedish \"Luki\" and \"Luku\", along with Finnish \"Lukki\") point to an origin in the Germanic root *\"luk\"-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish \"lokkanät\" and Faroese \"Lokkanet\" ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese \"lokki\"~\"grindalokki\"~\"grindalokkur\" ('daddy-long-legs', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in \"n\"- like \"Nokk(e)\", but this corresponds to the *\"luk\"- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *\"hnuk\"-, in contexts where western varieties used *\"luk\"-: \"\"nokke\" corresponds to \"nøkkel\"\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as \"loki\"~\"lokke\" to \"lykil\"\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian). While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at Ragnarök, \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop. Hence, it is natural that Loki is the inventor of the fishnet, which consists of loops and knots, and that the word \"loki\" (\"lokke\", \"lokki\", \"loke\", \"luki\") is a term for makers of cobwebs: spiders and the like.\" Though not prominent in the oldest sources, this identity as a \"tangler\" may be the etymological meaning of Loki's name.\n\nIn various poems from the \"Poetic Edda\" (stanza 2 of \"Lokasenna\", stanza 41 of \"Hyndluljóð\", and stanza 26 of \"Fjölsvinnsmál\"), and sections of the \"Prose Edda\" (chapter 32 of \"Gylfaginning\", stanza 8 of \"Haustlöng\", and stanza 1 of \"Þórsdrápa\") Loki is alternatively referred to as \"Loptr\", which is generally considered derived from Old Norse \"lopt\" meaning \"air\", and therefore points to an association with the air.\n\nThe name \"Hveðrungr\" (Old Norse '?roarer') is also used in reference to Loki, occurring in names for Hel (such as in \"Ynglingatal\", where she is called \"hveðrungs mær\") and in reference to Fenrir (as in \"Völuspa\").\n\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Loki appears (or is referenced) in the poems \"Völuspá\", \"Lokasenna\", \"Þrymskviða\", \"Reginsmál\", \"Baldrs draumar\", and \"Hyndluljóð\".\n\nIn stanza 35 of the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Völuspá\", a völva tells Odin that, among many other things, she sees Sigyn sitting very unhappily with her bound husband, Loki, under a \"grove of hot springs\". In stanza 51, during the events of Ragnarök, Loki appears free from his bonds and is referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\" (here transcribed as \"Byleist\"):\n\nIn stanza 54, after consuming Odin and being killed by Odin's son Víðarr, Fenrir is described as \"Loki's kinsman\".\n\nThe poem \"Lokasenna\" (Old Norse \"Loki's Quarrel\") centers around Loki flyting with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that Ægir, a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and elves. There, the gods praise Ægir's servers Fimafeng and Eldir. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.\n\nBULLET::::- Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their mead with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.\n\nBULLET::::- Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The skaldic god Bragi is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite. Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n\nOdin then asks his silent son Víðarr to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in Ægir's hall. Víðarr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of Ægir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.\n\nThe goddess Iðunn interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in Ægir's hall. Loki tells Iðunn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. Iðunn says that she won't say words of blame in Ægir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess Gefjun asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced seiðr (a type of sorcery) on the island of \"Samsey\" (now Samsø, Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.\n\nFrigg, a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of Fjörgyn, a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers Vili and Vé into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son Baldr in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.\n\nThe goddess Freyja declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother Freyr, when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. Njörðr (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"\n\nLoki tells Njörðr to be silent, recalling Njörðr's status as once having been a hostage from the Vanir to the Æsir during the Æsir-Vanir War, that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Njörðr \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Njörðr responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the Æsir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the Æsir. Loki tells Njörðr to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Njörðr fathered this son with his sister (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.\n\nThe god Tyr defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of Ragnarök. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.\n\nThe god Heimdallr says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess Skaði says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Skaði's father, Þjazi. Skaði says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Skaði was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of Laufey\") when Skaði once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"\n\nSif, wife of Thor, goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the Æsir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). Beyla (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"Æsir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"\n\nBULLET::::- The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer Mjöllnir he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at Ragnarök. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mjöllnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mjöllnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the Skrýmir (Útgarða-Loki in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mjöllnir, and says he will send Loki to Hel, below the gates of Nágrind.\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the Æsir,\" and \"before the sons of the Æsir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of \"Lokasenna\" with a final stanza:\n\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a salmon and hid in the waterfall of Franangrsfors, where the Æsir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son Nari, and his son Narfi changed into a wolf. Skaði fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.\n\nIn the poem \"Þrymskviða\", Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.\n\nIn Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr sits on a burial mound, plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the Elves; why is Loki alone in the Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir: that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr says that he has hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that Þrymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to Þrymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to Jötunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the Æsir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed Brísingamen, falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Brísingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of Laufey\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mjöllnir, and points out that without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in Jötunheimr. Þrymr commands the jötnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. Þrymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with Þrymr and the assembled jötnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the jötnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the jötnar bring out Mjöllnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess Vár. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes Þrymr, beats all of the jötnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the jötnar.\n\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem \"Reginsmál\". The prose introduction to \"Reginsmál\" details that, while the hero Sigurd was being fostered by Regin, son of Hreidmar, Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, Hœnir, and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; Andvari, who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a pike, and Ótr, who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, Ótr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess Rán, borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"norn of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river Vadgelmir, and that their suffering will be long.\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring Andvarinaut, which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.\n\nIn \"Baldr draumar\", Odin has awoken a deceased völva in Hel, and questions her repeatedly about his son Baldr's bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the völva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of Ragnarök.\n\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in \"Völuspá hin skamma\", found within the poem \"Hyndluljóð\". The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the jötunn Angrboða, that Loki himself gave birth to the horse Sleipnir by the stallion Svaðilfari, and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of Býleistr\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as \"Lopt\". Loki's consumption of a woman's heart is otherwise unattested.\n\nIn the poem \"Fjölsvinnsmál\", a stanza mentions Loki (as \"Lopt\") in association with runes. In the poem, Fjölsviðr describes to the hero Svipdagr that Sinmara keeps the weapon Lævateinn within a chest, locked with nine strong locks (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n\nThe \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\" tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse Sleipnir and Loki's contest with Logi, fire personified.\n\nHigh's introduction\n\nLoki first appears in the \"Prose Edda\" in chapter 20 of the book \"Gylfaginning\", where he is referred to as the \"ás called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of Third explains to \"Gangleri\" (King Gylfi in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of \"Lokasenna\".\n\nLoki is more formally introduced by High in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the Æsir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the Æsir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is \"Lopt\", that he is the son of the male jötunn Fárbauti, his mother is \"Laufey or Nál\", and his brothers are Helblindi and Býleistr. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the Æsir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female jötunn Angrboða from Jötunheimr; the wolf Fenrir, the serpent Jörmungandr, and the female being Hel. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in Jötunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrboða, but worse yet Loki. In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"—yet important—family.\n\nLoki, Svaðilfari, and Sleipnir\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established Midgard and built Val-Hall.\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks—to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as \"Loki Laufeyjarson\"—his surname derived from his mother's name, \"Laufey\").\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Svaðilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Svaðilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Svaðilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Svaðilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the Æsir realize that the builder is a hrimthurs, they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mjöllnir. However, Loki \"had such dealings\" with Svaðilfari that \"somewhat later\" Loki gives birth to a gray foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir—\"the best horse among gods and men.\"\n\nLoki, Útgarða-Loki, and Logi\n\nIn chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva.\n\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in Jötunheimr. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of Skrymir, who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skrýmir with his hammer. Skrýmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skrýmir. Skrýmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of Útgarðr it would be better for them to turn back now, for Útgarða-Loki's men there won't put up with it. Skrýmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the Æsir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see Útgarða-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.\n\nÚtgarða-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. Útgarða-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. Útgarða-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (\"Logi\", Old Norse \"flame\"), Þjálfi had raced against thought (\"Hugi\", Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, Jörmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (\"Elli\", Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. Útgarða-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.\n\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the Norwegian rune poem in connection with the Younger Futhark Bjarkan rune:\n\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"\n\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark. Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in \"Skáldskaparmál\" where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki's lips.\n\nThe stone is identified as a hearth stone; the nozzle of the bellows would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans Jørgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the Moesgård Museum near Aarhus, Denmark.\n\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, England, features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki. Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white sandstone, and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in Gainford, County Durham and is now housed in the Durham Cathedral Library.\n\nThe mid-11th century Gosforth Cross has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.\n\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as \"Lokke\". In Jutland, the phrases \"Lokke slår sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In Zealand the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist Axel Olrik cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n\nAnd in Thy, from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".\n\n\"Loka Táttur\" or \"Lokka Táttur\" (Faroese \"tale—or \"þáttr\"—of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and Hœnir helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning jötunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.\n\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"\n\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, Jacob Grimm was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, Sophus Bugge theorized Loki to be variant of Lucifer of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After World War II, four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of Folke Ström, who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a hypostasis of the god Odin. In 1959, Jan de Vries theorized that Loki is a typical example of a trickster figure. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, Anna Birgitta Rooth concluded that Loki was originally a spider. Anne Holtsmark, writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.\n\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar Ursula Dronke is that \"Lóðurr\" is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, Hœnir and Loki occur as a trio in \"Haustlöng\", in the prose prologue to \"Reginsmál\" and also in the \"Loka Táttur\" a Faroese ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"Lóðurr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"Hœnir's friend\" in \"Haustlöng\", strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in \"Völuspá\", seemingly conflicting with the image of Lóðurr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including Jan de Vries and Georges Dumézil, have also identified Lóðurr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur Þorgeirsson suggests that \"Loki\" and \"Lóðurr\" were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as Lóður in the rímur \"Lokrur\". Þorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the \"Prose Edda\", as Snorri does not mention Lóðurr. Since the contents of the \"Poetic Edda\" are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the rímur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. Þorgeirsson also points to \"Þrymlur\" where the same identification is made with Loki and Lóðurr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and Lóðurr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if Lóðurr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.\n\nThe scholar John Lindow highlights the recurring pattern of the bound monster in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture\". \n\nLoki appears in Richard Wagner's opera cycle Ring of the Nibelung as \"Loge\" (a play on Old Norse \"loge\", \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as Wotan's assistant rather than Donner's), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera \"Das Rheingold\", he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera \"Götterdämmerung\" Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions, some modern works interpret or depict the deity as genderfluid.\n\nIn 2008, five black smokers were discovered between Greenland and Norway, the most northerly group so far discovered, and given the name Loki's Castle, as their shape reminded discoverers of a fantasy castle, and (a University of Bergen press release says) \"Loki\" was \"an appropriate name for a field that was so difficult to locate\".\n\nLoki has been depicted in or is referred to in an array of media in modern popular culture. \n\nLoki appears in Marvel Comics and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a villain (or antihero), played by Tom Hiddleston, where he consistently comes into conflict with the superhero Thor, his adopted brother and archenemy.\n\nLoki appears in Warriors Orochi 4, he hides in Perseus's identity and rebel against Zeus's machinations by entering Orochi's dimensional realm.\n\nLoki appears in the 1975 fantasy novel \"Eight Days of Luke\" by Diana Wynne Jones. He is also a central character in Neil Gaiman's novel \"American Gods\" and an important character in a few arcs of Gaiman's comic \"The Sandman\".\n\nThe eponymous mask of the 1994 film \"The Mask\" is said in the film to be the mask of Loki.  Lore behind the mask is explored in more detail in the 2005 sequel, \"Son of the Mask\", where the god of mischief himself, played by Alan Cumming, has a prominent role.\n\n\nBULLET::::- Dystheism\n\nBULLET::::- MyNDIR (My Norse Digital Image Repository) Illustrations of Loki from manuscripts and early print books.

{"id": "18016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18016", "title": "Lisp (programming language)", "text": "Lisp (programming language)\n\nLisp (historically LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.\nOriginally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Clojure, Common Lisp, and Scheme.\n\nLisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read–eval–print loop.\n\nThe name \"LISP\" derives from \"LISt Processor\". Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages embedded in Lisp.\n\nThe interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as \"s-expressions\", or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator's name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function that takes three arguments would be called as .\n\nJohn McCarthy developed Lisp in 1958 while he was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). McCarthy published its design in a paper in \"Communications of the ACM\" in 1960, entitled \"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I\". He showed that with a few simple operators and a notation for functions, one can build a Turing-complete language for algorithms.\n\nInformation Processing Language was the first AI language, from 1955 or 1956, and already included many of the concepts, such as list-processing and recursion, which came to be used in Lisp.\n\nMcCarthy's original notation used bracketed \"M-expressions\" that would be translated into S-expressions. As an example, the M-expression is equivalent to the S-expression . Once Lisp was implemented, programmers rapidly chose to use S-expressions, and M-expressions were abandoned. M-expressions surfaced again with short-lived attempts of MLisp by Horace Enea and CGOL by Vaughan Pratt.\n\nLisp was first implemented by Steve Russell on an IBM 704 computer. Russell had read McCarthy's paper and realized (to McCarthy's surprise) that the Lisp \"eval\" function could be implemented in machine code. The result was a working Lisp interpreter which could be used to run Lisp programs, or more properly, \"evaluate Lisp expressions\".\n\nTwo assembly language macros for the IBM 704 became the primitive operations for decomposing lists: (\"Contents of the Address part of Register\" number) and (\"Contents of the Decrement part of Register\" number), where \"register\" is used to refer to registers of the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Lisp dialects still use and ( and ) for the operations that return the first item in a list and the rest of the list, respectively.\n\nThe first complete Lisp compiler, written in Lisp, was implemented in 1962 by Tim Hart and Mike Levin at MIT. This compiler introduced the Lisp model of incremental compilation, in which compiled and interpreted functions can intermix freely. The language used in Hart and Levin's memo is much closer to modern Lisp style than McCarthy's earlier code.\n\nThe first garbage collection routines were developed by MIT graduate student Daniel Edwards.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, a great effort was made to unify the work on new Lisp dialects (mostly successors to Maclisp such as ZetaLisp and NIL (New Implementation of Lisp) into a single language. The new language, Common Lisp, was somewhat compatible with the dialects it replaced (the book \"Common Lisp the Language\" notes the compatibility of various constructs). In 1994, ANSI published the Common Lisp standard, \"ANSI X3.226-1994 Information Technology Programming Language Common Lisp\".\n\nSince inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence research community, especially on PDP-10 systems. Lisp was used as the implementation of the programming language Micro Planner, which was used in the famous AI system SHRDLU. In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of existing Lisp systems became a growing issue.\n\nOver its sixty-year history, Lisp has spawned many variations on the core theme of an S-expression language. Moreover, each given dialect may have several implementations—for instance, there are more than a dozen implementations of Common Lisp.\n\nDifferences between dialects may be quite visible—for instance, Common Lisp uses the keyword codice_1 to name a function, but Scheme uses codice_2. Within a dialect that is standardized, however, conforming implementations support the same core language, but with different extensions and libraries.\n\nBULLET::::- LISP 1 – First implementation.\nBULLET::::- LISP 1.5 – First widely distributed version, developed by McCarthy and others at MIT. So named because it contained several improvements on the original \"LISP 1\" interpreter, but was not a major restructuring as the planned LISP 2 would be.\nBULLET::::- Stanford LISP 1.6 – This was a successor to LISP 1.5 developed at the Stanford AI Lab, and widely distributed to PDP-10 systems running the TOPS-10 operating system.

It ran on the PDP-10 and Multics systems. (MACLISP would later come to be called Maclisp, and is often referred to as MacLisp.)\nBULLET::::- Interlisp – developed at BBN Technologies for PDP-10 systems running the TENEX operating system, later adopted as a \"West coast\" Lisp for the Xerox Lisp machines as InterLisp-D. A small version called \"InterLISP 65\" was published for the 6502-based Atari 8-bit family computer line. For quite some time, Maclisp and InterLisp were strong competitors.\nBULLET::::- Franz Lisp – originally a University of California, Berkeley project; later developed by Franz Inc.

This version of Common Lisp was available for wide-ranging platforms and was accepted by many as a de facto standard until the publication of ANSI Common Lisp (ANSI X3.226-1994). Among the most widespread sub-dialects of Common Lisp are Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), CMU Common Lisp (CMU-CL), Clozure OpenMCL (not to be confused with Clojure!), GNU CLisp, and later versions of Franz Lisp; all of them adhere to the later ANSI CL standard (see below).\nBULLET::::- Dylan was in its first version a mix of Scheme with the Common Lisp Object System.\nBULLET::::- EuLisp – attempt to develop a new efficient and cleaned-up Lisp.\nBULLET::::- ISLISP – attempt to develop a new efficient and cleaned-up Lisp.

Most new activity has been focused around implementations of Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Clojure, and Racket, and includes development of new portable libraries and applications.\n\nMany new Lisp programmers were inspired by writers such as Paul Graham and Eric S. Raymond to pursue a language others considered antiquated. New Lisp programmers often describe the language as an eye-opening experience and claim to be substantially more productive than in other languages. This increase in awareness may be contrasted to the \"AI winter\" and Lisp's brief gain in the mid-1990s.\n\nDan Weinreb lists in his survey of Common Lisp implementations eleven actively maintained Common Lisp implementations. Scieneer Common Lisp is a new commercial implementation forked from CMUCL with a first release in 2002.\n\nThe open source community has created new supporting infrastructure: CLiki is a wiki that collects Common Lisp related information, the Common Lisp directory lists resources, #lisp is a popular IRC channel and allows the sharing and commenting of code snippets (with support by lisppaste, an IRC bot written in Lisp), Planet Lisp collects the contents of various Lisp-related blogs, on LispForum users discuss Lisp topics, Lispjobs is a service for announcing job offers and there is a weekly news service, \"Weekly Lisp News\". \"Common-lisp.net\" is a hosting site for open source Common Lisp projects. Quicklisp is a library manager for Common Lisp.\n\nFifty years of Lisp (1958–2008) was celebrated at LISP50@OOPSLA. There are regular local user meetings in Boston, Vancouver, and Hamburg. Other events include the European Common Lisp Meeting, the European Lisp Symposium and an International Lisp Conference.\n\nThe Scheme community actively maintains over twenty implementations. Several significant new implementations (Chicken, Gambit, Gauche, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon) have been developed in the 2000s (decade). The Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme standard of Scheme was widely accepted in the Scheme community. The Scheme Requests for Implementation process has created a lot of quasi standard libraries and extensions for Scheme. User communities of individual Scheme implementations continue to grow. A new language standardization process was started in 2003 and led to the RRS Scheme standard in 2007. Academic use of Scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat. Some universities are no longer using Scheme in their computer science introductory courses; MIT now uses Python instead of Scheme for its undergraduate computer science program and MITx massive open online course.\n\nThere are several new dialects of Lisp: Arc, Hy, Nu, Liskell, and LFE (Lisp Flavored Erlang). The parser for Julia is implemented in Femtolisp, a dialect of Scheme (Julia is inspired by Scheme, and is often considered a Lisp).\n\nIn October 2019, Paul Graham released a specification for Bel, \"a new dialect of Lisp.\"\n\nCommon Lisp and Scheme represent two major streams of Lisp development. These languages embody significantly different design choices.\n\nCommon Lisp is a successor to Maclisp. The primary influences were Lisp Machine Lisp, Maclisp, NIL, S-1 Lisp, Spice Lisp, and Scheme. It has many of the features of Lisp Machine Lisp (a large Lisp dialect used to program Lisp Machines), but was designed to be efficiently implementable on any personal computer or workstation. Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language and thus has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, and an object system (Common Lisp Object System). Common Lisp also borrowed certain features from Scheme such as lexical scoping and lexical closures. Common Lisp implementations are available for targeting different platforms such as the LLVM, the Java virtual machine, \nx86-64, PowerPC, Alpha, ARM, Motorola 68000, and MIPS, and operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Dragonfly BSD, and Heroku.\n\nScheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy L. Steele, Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. It was designed to have exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions. Designed about a decade earlier than Common Lisp, Scheme is a more minimalist design. It has a much smaller set of standard features but with certain implementation features (such as tail-call optimization and full continuations) not specified in Common Lisp. A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in Scheme. Scheme continues to evolve with a series of standards (Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme) and a series of Scheme Requests for Implementation.\n\nClojure is a recent dialect of Lisp that targets mainly the Java virtual machine, and the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Python VM, the Ruby VM YARV, and compiling to JavaScript. It is designed to be a pragmatic general-purpose language. Clojure draws considerable influences from Haskell and places a very strong emphasis on immutability. Clojure provides access to Java frameworks and libraries, with optional type hints and type inference, so that calls to Java can avoid reflection and enable fast primitive operations. Clojure is not designed to be backwards compatible with other Lisp dialects.\n\nFurther, Lisp dialects are used as scripting languages in many applications, with the best-known being Emacs Lisp in the Emacs editor, AutoLISP and later Visual Lisp in AutoCAD, Nyquist in Audacity, Scheme in LilyPond. The potential small size of a useful Scheme interpreter makes it particularly popular for embedded scripting. Examples include SIOD and TinyScheme, both of which have been successfully embedded in the GIMP image processor under the generic name \"Script-fu\". LIBREP, a Lisp interpreter by John Harper originally based on the Emacs Lisp language, has been embedded in the Sawfish window manager.\n\nLisp has officially standardized dialects: R6RS Scheme, R7RS Scheme, IEEE Scheme, ANSI Common Lisp and ISO ISLISP.\n\nLisp was the first language where the structure of program code is represented faithfully and directly in a standard data structure—a quality much later dubbed \"homoiconicity\". Thus, Lisp functions can be manipulated, altered or even created within a Lisp program without lower-level manipulations. This is generally considered one of the main advantages of the language with regard to its expressive power, and makes the language suitable for syntactic macros and metacircular evaluation.\n\nA conditional using an \"if–then–else\" syntax was invented by McCarthy in a Fortran context. He proposed its inclusion in ALGOL, but it was not made part of the Algol 58 specification. For Lisp, McCarthy used the more general \"cond\"-structure. Algol 60 took up \"if–then–else\" and popularized it.\n\nLisp deeply influenced Alan Kay, the leader of the research team that developed Smalltalk at Xerox PARC; and in turn Lisp was influenced by Smalltalk, with later dialects adopting object-oriented programming features (inheritance classes, encapsulating instances, message passing, etc.) in the 1970s. The Flavors object system introduced the concept of multiple inheritance and the mixin. The Common Lisp Object System provides multiple inheritance, multimethods with multiple dispatch, and first-class generic functions, yielding a flexible and powerful form of dynamic dispatch. It has served as the template for many subsequent Lisp (including Scheme) object systems, which are often implemented via a metaobject protocol, a reflective metacircular design in which the object system is defined in terms of itself: Lisp was only the second language after Smalltalk (and is still one of the very few languages) to possess such a metaobject system. Many years later, Alan Kay suggested that as a result of the confluence of these features, only Smalltalk and Lisp could be regarded as properly conceived object-oriented programming systems.\n\nLisp introduced the concept of automatic garbage collection, in which the system walks the heap looking for unused memory. Progress in modern sophisticated garbage collection algorithms such as generational garbage collection was stimulated by its use in Lisp.\n\nEdsger W. Dijkstra in his 1972 Turing Award lecture said,\n\nLargely because of its resource requirements with respect to early computing hardware (including early microprocessors), Lisp did not become as popular outside of the AI community as Fortran and the ALGOL-descended C language. Because of its suitability to complex and dynamic applications, Lisp is enjoying some resurgence of popular interest in the 2010s.\n\nLisp is an expression oriented language. Unlike most other languages, no distinction is made between \"expressions\" and \"statements\"; all code and data are written as expressions. When an expression is \"evaluated\", it produces a value (in Common Lisp, possibly multiple values), which can then be embedded into other expressions. Each value can be any data type.\n\nMcCarthy's 1958 paper introduced two types of syntax: \"Symbolic expressions\" (S-expressions, sexps), which mirror the internal representation of code and data; and \"Meta expressions\" (M-expressions), which express functions of S-expressions. M-expressions never found favor, and almost all Lisps today use S-expressions to manipulate both code and data.\n\nThe use of parentheses is Lisp's most immediately obvious difference from other programming language families. As a result, students have long given Lisp nicknames such as \"Lost In Stupid Parentheses\", or \"Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses\". However, the S-expression syntax is also responsible for much of Lisp's power: the syntax is extremely regular, which facilitates manipulation by computer. However, the syntax of Lisp is not limited to traditional parentheses notation. It can be extended to include alternative notations. For example, XMLisp is a Common Lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate S-expressions with the Extensible Markup Language (XML).\n\nThe reliance on expressions gives the language great flexibility. Because Lisp functions are written as lists, they can be processed exactly like data. This allows easy writing of programs which manipulate other programs (metaprogramming). Many Lisp dialects exploit this feature using macro systems, which enables extension of the language almost without limit.\n\nA Lisp list is written with its elements separated by whitespace, and surrounded by parentheses. For example, is a list whose elements are the three \"atoms\" , , and . These values are implicitly typed: they are respectively two integers and a Lisp-specific data type called a \"symbol\", and do not have to be declared as such.\n\nThe empty list is also represented as the special atom . This is the only entity in Lisp which is both an atom and a list.\n\nExpressions are written as lists, using prefix notation. The first element in the list is the name of a function, the name of a macro, a lambda expression or the name of a \"special operator\" (see below). The remainder of the list are the arguments. For example, the function returns its arguments as a list, so the expression\n\nevaluates to the list . The \"quote\" before the in the preceding example is a \"special operator\" which returns its argument without evaluating it. Any unquoted expressions are recursively evaluated before the enclosing expression is evaluated. For example,\n\nevaluates to the list . Note that the third argument is a list; lists can be nested.\n\nArithmetic operators are treated similarly. The expression\n\nevaluates to 10. The equivalent under infix notation would be \"\".\n\nLisp has no notion of operators as implemented in Algol-derived languages. Arithmetic operators in Lisp are variadic functions (or \"n-ary\"), able to take any number of arguments. A C-style '++' increment operator is sometimes implemented under the name incf giving syntax \n\nequivalent to (setq x (+ x 1)), returning the new value of x.\n\n\"Special operators\" (sometimes called \"special forms\") provide Lisp's control structure. For example, the special operator takes three arguments. If the first argument is non-nil, it evaluates to the second argument; otherwise, it evaluates to the third argument. Thus, the expression\n\nevaluates to . Of course, this would be more useful if a non-trivial expression had been substituted in place of .\n\nLisp also provides logical operators and, or and not. The and and or operators do short circuit evaluation and will return their first nil and non-nil argument respectively.\n\nwill evaluate to \"James\".\n\nAnother special operator, , is used to bind variables to values which are then evaluated within an expression. This operator is also used to create functions: the arguments to are a list of arguments, and the expression or expressions to which the function evaluates (the returned value is the value of the last expression that is evaluated). The expression\n\nevaluates to a function that, when applied, takes one argument, binds it to and returns the number one greater than that argument. Lambda expressions are treated no differently from named functions; they are invoked the same way. Therefore, the expression\n\nevaluates to . Here, we're doing a function application: we execute the anonymous function by passing to it the value 5.\n\nNamed functions are created by storing a lambda expression in a symbol using the defun macro.\n\nIn the original LISP there were two fundamental data types: atoms and lists. A list was a finite ordered sequence of elements, where each element is either an atom or a list, and an atom was a number or a symbol. A symbol was essentially a unique named item, written as an alphanumeric string in source code, and used either as a variable name or as a data item in symbolic processing. For example, the list contains three elements: the symbol , the list , and the number 2.\n\nThe essential difference between atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique. Two atoms that appeared in different places in source code but were written in exactly the same way represented the same object, whereas each list was a separate object that could be altered independently of other lists and could be distinguished from other lists by comparison operators.\n\nAs more data types were introduced in later Lisp dialects, and programming styles evolved, the concept of an atom lost importance. Many dialects still retained the predicate \"atom\" for legacy compatibility, defining it true for any object which is not a cons.\n\nA Lisp list is implemented as a singly linked list. Each cell of this list is called a \"cons\" (in Scheme, a \"pair\"), and is composed of two pointers, called the \"car\" and \"cdr\". These are respectively equivalent to the and fields discussed in the article \"linked list\".\n\nOf the many data structures that can be built out of cons cells, one of the most basic is called a \"proper list\". A proper list is either the special (empty list) symbol, or a cons in which the points to a datum (which may be another cons structure, such as a list), and the points to another proper list.\n\nIf a given cons is taken to be the head of a linked list, then its car points to the first element of the list, and its cdr points to the rest of the list. For this reason, the and functions are also called and when referring to conses which are part of a linked list (rather than, say, a tree).\n\nThus, a Lisp list is not an atomic object, as an instance of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list is nothing more than an aggregate of linked conses. A variable which refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list can be done by \"cdring down\" the list; that is, taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.\n\nBecause conses and lists are so universal in Lisp systems, it is a common misconception that they are Lisp's only data structures. In fact, all but the most simplistic Lisps have other data structures, such as vectors (arrays), hash tables, structures, and so forth.\n\nParenthesized S-expressions represent linked list structures. There are several ways to represent the same list as an S-expression. A cons can be written in \"dotted-pair notation\" as , where is the car and the cdr. A longer proper list might be written in dotted-pair notation. This is conventionally abbreviated as in \"list notation\". An improper list may be written in a combination of the two – as for the list of three conses whose last cdr is (i.e., the list in fully specified form).\n\nLisp provides many built-in procedures for accessing and controlling lists. Lists can be created directly with the procedure, which takes any number of arguments, and returns the list of these arguments.\n\nBecause of the way that lists are constructed from cons pairs, the procedure can be used to add an element to the front of a list. Note that the procedure is asymmetric in how it handles list arguments, because of how lists are constructed.\n\nThe procedure appends two (or more) lists to one another. Because Lisp lists are linked lists, appending two lists has asymptotic time complexity formula_1\n\nLisp lists, being simple linked lists, can share structure with one another. That is to say, two lists can have the same \"tail\", or final sequence of conses. For instance, after the execution of the following Common Lisp code:\n\nthe lists and are and respectively. However, the tail is the same structure in both lists. It is not a copy; the cons cells pointing to and are in the same memory locations for both lists.\n\nSharing structure rather than copying can give a dramatic performance improvement. However, this technique can interact in undesired ways with functions that alter lists passed to them as arguments. Altering one list, such as by replacing the with a , will affect the other:\n\nThis changes to , but thereby also changes to – a possibly unexpected result. This can be a source of bugs, and functions which alter their arguments are documented as \"destructive\" for this very reason.\n\nAficionados of functional programming avoid destructive functions. In the Scheme dialect, which favors the functional style, the names of destructive functions are marked with a cautionary exclamation point, or \"bang\"—such as (read \"set car bang\"), which replaces the car of a cons. In the Common Lisp dialect, destructive functions are commonplace; the equivalent of is named for \"replace car.\" This function is rarely seen however as Common Lisp includes a special facility, , to make it easier to define and use destructive functions. A frequent style in Common Lisp is to write code functionally (without destructive calls) when prototyping, then to add destructive calls as an optimization where it is safe to do so.\n\nLisp evaluates expressions which are entered by the user. Symbols and lists evaluate to some other (usually, simpler) expression – for instance, a symbol evaluates to the value of the variable it names; evaluates to . However, most other forms evaluate to themselves: if entering into Lisp, it returns .\n\nAny expression can also be marked to prevent it from being evaluated (as is necessary for symbols and lists). This is the role of the special operator, or its abbreviation (one quotation mark). For instance, usually if entering the symbol , it returns the value of the corresponding variable (or an error, if there is no such variable). To refer to the literal symbol, enter or, usually, .\n\nBoth Common Lisp and Scheme also support the \"backquote\" operator (termed \"quasiquote\" in Scheme), entered with the character (grave accent). This is almost the same as the plain quote, except it allows expressions to be evaluated and their values interpolated into a quoted list with the comma \"unquote\" and comma-at \"splice\" operators. If the variable has the value then evaluates to , while evaluates to . The backquote is most often used in defining macro expansions.\n\nSelf-evaluating forms and quoted forms are Lisp's equivalent of literals. It may be possible to modify the values of (mutable) literals in program code. For instance, if a function returns a quoted form, and the code that calls the function modifies the form, this may alter the behavior of the function on subsequent iterations.\n\nModifying a quoted form like this is generally considered bad style, and is defined by ANSI Common Lisp as erroneous (resulting in \"undefined\" behavior in compiled files, because the file-compiler can coalesce similar constants, put them in write-protected memory, etc.).\n\nLisp's formalization of quotation has been noted by Douglas Hofstadter (in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\") and others as an example of the philosophical idea of self-reference.\n\nThe Lisp family splits over the use of dynamic or static (a.k.a. lexical) scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static scoping by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the embedded languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use dynamic scoping. Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both dynamic and lexical scoping.\n\nA fundamental distinction between Lisp and other languages is that in Lisp, the textual representation of a program is simply a human-readable description of the same internal data structures (linked lists, symbols, number, characters, etc.) as would be used by the underlying Lisp system.\n\nLisp uses this to implement a very powerful macro system. Like other macro languages such as C, a macro returns code that can then be compiled. However, unlike C macros, the macros are Lisp functions and so can exploit the full power of Lisp.\n\nFurther, because Lisp code has the same structure as lists, macros can be built with any of the list-processing functions in the language. In short, anything that Lisp can do to a data structure, Lisp macros can do to code. In contrast, in most other languages, the parser's output is purely internal to the language implementation and cannot be manipulated by the programmer.\n\nThis feature makes it easy to develop \"efficient\" languages within languages. For example, the Common Lisp Object System can be implemented cleanly as a language extension using macros. This means that if an application needs a different inheritance mechanism, it can use a different object system. This is in stark contrast to most other languages; for example, Java does not support multiple inheritance and there is no reasonable way to add it.\n\nIn simplistic Lisp implementations, this list structure is directly interpreted to run the program; a function is literally a piece of list structure which is traversed by the interpreter in executing it. However, most substantial Lisp systems also include a compiler. The compiler translates list structure into machine code or bytecode for execution. This code can run as fast as code compiled in conventional languages such as C.\n\nMacros expand before the compilation step, and thus offer some interesting options. If a program needs a precomputed table, then a macro might create the table at compile time, so the compiler need only output the table and need not call code to create the table at run time. Some Lisp implementations even have a mechanism, codice_3, that allows code to be present during compile time (when a macro would need it), but not present in the emitted module.\n\nLisp languages are often used with an interactive command line, which may be combined with an integrated development environment (IDE). The user types in expressions at the command line, or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp \"reads\" the entered expressions, \"evaluates\" them, and \"prints\" the result. For this reason, the Lisp command line is called a \"read–eval–print loop\" (REPL).\n\nThe basic operation of the REPL is as follows. This is a simplistic description which omits many elements of a real Lisp, such as quoting and macros.\n\nThe function accepts textual S-expressions as input, and parses them into an internal data structure. For instance, if you type the text at the prompt, translates this into a linked list with three elements: the symbol , the number 1, and the number 2. It so happens that this list is also a valid piece of Lisp code; that is, it can be evaluated. This is because the car of the list names a function—the addition operation.\n\nNote that a will be read as a single symbol. will be read as the number one hundred and twenty-three. will be read as the string \"123\".\n\nThe function evaluates the data, returning zero or more other Lisp data as a result. Evaluation does not have to mean interpretation; some Lisp systems compile every expression to native machine code. It is simple, however, to describe evaluation as interpretation: To evaluate a list whose car names a function, first evaluates each of the arguments given in its cdr, then applies the function to the arguments. In this case, the function is addition, and applying it to the argument list yields the answer . This is the result of the evaluation.\n\nThe symbol evaluates to the value of the symbol foo. Data like the string \"123\" evaluates to the same string. The list evaluates to the list (1 2 3).\n\nIt is the job of the function to represent output to the user. For a simple result such as this is trivial. An expression which evaluated to a piece of list structure would require that traverse the list and print it out as an S-expression.\n\nTo implement a Lisp REPL, it is necessary only to implement these three functions and an infinite-loop function. (Naturally, the implementation of will be complex, since it must also implement all special operators like or .) This done, a basic REPL is one line of code: .\n\nThe Lisp REPL typically also provides input editing, an input history, error handling and an interface to the debugger.\n\nLisp is usually evaluated eagerly. In Common Lisp, arguments are evaluated in applicative order ('leftmost innermost'), while in Scheme order of arguments is undefined, leaving room for optimization by a compiler.\n\nLisp originally had very few control structures, but many more were added during the language's evolution. (Lisp's original conditional operator, , is the precursor to later structures.)\n\nProgrammers in the Scheme dialect often express loops using tail recursion. Scheme's commonality in academic computer science has led some students to believe that tail recursion is the only, or the most common, way to write iterations in Lisp, but this is incorrect. All oft-seen Lisp dialects have imperative-style iteration constructs, from Scheme's loop to Common Lisp's complex expressions. Moreover, the key issue that makes this an objective rather than subjective matter is that Scheme makes specific requirements for the handling of tail calls, and thus the reason that the use of tail recursion is generally encouraged for Scheme is that the practice is expressly supported by the language definition. By contrast, ANSI Common Lisp does not require the optimization commonly termed a tail call elimination. Thus, the fact that tail recursive style as a casual replacement for the use of more traditional iteration constructs (such as , or ) is discouraged in Common Lisp is not just a matter of stylistic preference, but potentially one of efficiency (since an apparent tail call in Common Lisp may not compile as a simple jump) and program correctness (since tail recursion may increase stack use in Common Lisp, risking stack overflow).\n\nSome Lisp control structures are \"special operators\", equivalent to other languages' syntactic keywords. Expressions using these operators have the same surface appearance as function calls, but differ in that the arguments are not necessarily evaluated—or, in the case of an iteration expression, may be evaluated more than once.\n\nIn contrast to most other major programming languages, Lisp allows implementing control structures using the language. Several control structures are implemented as Lisp macros, and can even be macro-expanded by the programmer who wants to know how they work.\n\nBoth Common Lisp and Scheme have operators for non-local control flow. The differences in these operators are some of the deepest differences between the two dialects. Scheme supports \"re-entrant continuations\" using the procedure, which allows a program to save (and later restore) a particular place in execution. Common Lisp does not support re-entrant continuations, but does support several ways of handling escape continuations.\n\nOften, the same algorithm can be expressed in Lisp in either an imperative or a functional style. As noted above, Scheme tends to favor the functional style, using tail recursion and continuations to express control flow. However, imperative style is still quite possible. The style preferred by many Common Lisp programmers may seem more familiar to programmers used to structured languages such as C, while that preferred by Schemers more closely resembles pure-functional languages such as Haskell.\n\nBecause of Lisp's early heritage in list processing, it has a wide array of higher-order functions relating to iteration over sequences. In many cases where an explicit loop would be needed in other languages (like a loop in C) in Lisp the same task can be accomplished with a higher-order function. (The same is true of many functional programming languages.)\n\nA good example is a function which in Scheme is called and in Common Lisp is called . Given a function and one or more lists, applies the function successively to the lists' elements in order, collecting the results in a new list:\n\nThis applies the function to each corresponding pair of list elements, yielding the result .\n\nHere are examples of Common Lisp code.\n\nThe basic \"Hello world\" program:\n\nLisp syntax lends itself naturally to recursion. Mathematical problems such as the enumeration of recursively defined sets are simple to express in this notation.\n\nEvaluate a number's factorial:\n\nAn alternative implementation takes less stack space than the previous version if the underlying Lisp system optimizes tail recursion:\n\nContrast with an iterative version which uses Common Lisp's macro:\n\nThe following function reverses a list. (Lisp's built-in \"reverse\" function does the same thing.)\n\nVarious object systems and models have been built on top of, alongside, or into Lisp, including:\nBULLET::::- The Common Lisp Object System, CLOS, is an integral part of ANSI Common Lisp.

{"id": "18020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18020", "title": "Lost city", "text": "Lost city\n\nA lost city is a settlement that fell into terminal decline and became extensively or completely uninhabited, with the consequence that the site's former significance was no longer known to the wider world. The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten, but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists. Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns. The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia from the 15th century onwards eventually led to the development of archaeology.\n\nLost cities generally fall into two broad categories: those where all knowledge of the city's existence was forgotten before it was rediscovered, and those whose memory was preserved in myth, legend, or historical records but whose location was lost or at least no longer widely recognized.\n\nCities may become lost for a variety of reasons including natural disasters, economic or social upheaval, or war.\n\nThe Incan capital city of Vilcabamba was destroyed and depopulated during the Spanish conquest of Peru in 1572. The Spanish did not rebuild the city, and the location went unrecorded and was forgotten until it was rediscovered through a detailed examination of period letters and documents.\n\nTroy was a city located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey. It is best known for being the focus of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the \"Iliad\", one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, the city slowly declined and was abandoned in the Byzantine era. Buried by time, the city was consigned to the realm of legend until the location was first excavated in the 1860s.\n\nOther settlements are lost with few or no clues to their decline. For example, Malden Island, in the central Pacific, was deserted when first visited by Europeans in 1825, but the unsuspected presence of ruined temples and the remains of other structures found on the island indicate that a population of Polynesians had lived there for perhaps several generations some centuries earlier. Prolonged drought seems the most likely explanation for their demise and the remote nature of the island meant few visitors.\n\nWith the development of archaeology and the application of modern techniques, many previously lost cities have been rediscovered.\n\nMachu Picchu is a pre-Columbian Inca site situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley in Peru. Often referred to as the \"Lost City of the Incas\", it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World. Machu Picchu was built around 1450, at the height of the Inca Empire. It was abandoned just over 100 years later, in 1572, as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area. In 1911, Melchor Arteaga led the explorer Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu, which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediate valley.\n\nHelike was an ancient Greek city that sank at night in the winter of 373 BCE. The city was located in Achaea, Northern Peloponnesos, two kilometres (12 stadia) from the Corinthian Gulf. The city was thought to be legend until 2001, when it was rediscovered in the Helike Delta. In 1988, the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou launched the Helike Project to locate the site of the lost city. In 1994, in collaboration with the University of Patras, a magnetometer survey was carried out in the midplain of the delta, which revealed the outlines of a buried building. In 1995, this target was excavated (now known as the Klonis site), and a large Roman building with standing walls was brought to light. The city was rediscovered in 2001, buried in an ancient lagoon.\n\nSome cities which are considered lost are (or may be) places of legend.\nBULLET::::- Ai – important city in the Hebrew Bible\nBULLET::::- Arthurian Camelot\nBULLET::::- Atlantis\nBULLET::::- Aztlán- the ancestral homeland in Aztec mythology\nBULLET::::- Ciudad de los Cesares (City of the Caesars, also variously known as City of the Patagonia, Elelín, Lin Lin, Trapalanda, Trapananda, or Wandering City) – a legendary city in Patagonia, never found\nBULLET::::- Dvārakā – An ancient city of Krishna, submerged in the sea.\nBULLET::::- El Dorado\nBULLET::::- Iram of the Pillars – this may refer to a lost Arabian city in the Empty Quarter, but sources also identify it as a tribe or an area mentioned in the Quran\nBULLET::::- Kitezh, Russia – legendary underwater city which supposedly may be seen in good weather\nBULLET::::- Libertatia, Madagascar - (Also known as Libertalia) is pirate colony founded in the 17th Century by Pirate Captain James Misson (occasionally spelled \"Mission\") that is still disputed by historians today.\nBULLET::::- Lost City of Z – a city allegedly located in the jungles of the Mato Grosso region of Brazil, said to have been seen by the British explorer Col.

{"id": "18023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18023", "title": "Louis Agassiz", "text": "Louis Agassiz\n\nJean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz (; ; May 28, 1807December 14, 1873) was a Swiss biologist and geologist recognized as an innovative and prodigious scholar of Earth's natural history. Agassiz grew up in Switzerland. He received doctor of philosophy and medical degrees at Erlangen and Munich, respectively. After studying with Cuvier and Humboldt in Paris, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel. He emigrated to the United States in 1847 after visiting Harvard University. He went on to become professor of zoology and geology at Harvard, to head its Lawrence Scientific School, and to found its Museum of Comparative Zoology.\n\nAgassiz is known for his regimen of observational data gathering and analysis. He made vast institutional and scientific contributions to zoology, geology, and related areas, including writing multivolume research books running to thousands of pages. He is particularly known for his contributions to ichthyological classification, including of extinct species such as megalodon, and to the study of geological history, including to the founding of glaciology. \n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Agassiz's resistance to Darwinian evolution, belief in creationism, and the scientific racism implicit in his writings on human polygenism have tarnished his reputation, and led to controversies over his legacy.\n\nLouis Agassiz was born in Môtier (now part of Haut-Vully) in the Swiss canton of Fribourg. The son of a pastor, Agassiz was educated first at home; he then spent four years of secondary school in Bienne, entering in 1818 and completing his elementary studies in Lausanne. Agassiz studied successively at the universities of Zürich, Heidelberg, and Munich; while there, he extended his knowledge of natural history, especially of botany. In 1829, he received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Erlangen, and in 1830, that of doctor of medicine at Munich. Moving to Paris, he came under the tutelage of Alexander von Humboldt (and later his financial benevolence). Humboldt and Georges Cuvier launched him on his careers of geology and zoology, respectively. Ichthyology soon became a focus of his life's work.\n\nIn 1819–1820, German biologists Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius undertook an expedition to Brazil. They returned home to Europe with many natural objects, including an important collection of the freshwater fish of Brazil, especially of the Amazon River. Spix, who died in 1826, did not live long enough to work out the history of these fish, and Martius selected Agassiz for this project. Agassiz threw himself into the work with an enthusiasm that would go on to characterize the rest of life's work. The task of describing the Brazilian fish was completed and published in 1829. This was followed by research into the history of fish found in Lake Neuchâtel. Enlarging his plans, in 1830, he issued a prospectus of a \"History of the Freshwater Fish of Central Europe\". In 1839, however, the first part of this publication appeared, and it was completed in 1842.\n\nIn 1832, Agassiz was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Neuchâtel. The fossil fish in the rock of the surrounding region, the slates of Glarus and the limestones of Monte Bolca, soon attracted his attention. At the time, very little had been accomplished in their scientific study. Agassiz, as early as 1829, planned the publication of a work, which more than any other, laid the foundation of his worldwide fame. Five volumes of his \"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\" (\"Research on Fossil Fish\") were published from 1833 to 1843. They were magnificently illustrated, chiefly by Joseph Dinkel. In gathering materials for this work, Agassiz visited the principal museums in Europe, and meeting Cuvier in Paris, he received much encouragement and assistance from him. They had known him for seven years at the time.\n\nAgassiz found that his palaeontological analyses required a new ichthyological classification. The fossils he examined rarely showed any traces of the soft tissues of fish, but, instead, consisted chiefly of the teeth, scales, and fins, with the bones being perfectly preserved in comparatively few instances. He, therefore, adopted a classification that divided fish into four groups: ganoids, placoids, cycloids, and ctenoids, based on the nature of the scales and other dermal appendages. This did much to improve fish taxonomy, but Aggasiz's classification has since been superseded.\n\nAgassiz needed financial support to continue his work. The British Association and the Earl of Ellesmere—then Lord Francis Egerton—stepped in to help. The 1,290 original drawings made for the work were purchased by the Earl, and presented by him to the Geological Society of London. In 1836, the Wollaston Medal was awarded to Agassiz by the council of that society for his work on fossil ichthyology; and, in 1838, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. Meanwhile, invertebrate animals engaged his attention. In 1837, he issued the \"Prodrome\" of a monograph on the recent and fossil Echinodermata, the first part of which appeared in 1838; in 1839–40, he published two quarto volumes on the fossil echinoderms of Switzerland; and in 1840–45, he issued his \"Études critiques sur les mollusques fossiles\" (\"Critical Studies on Fossil Mollusks\").\n\nBefore Agassiz's first visit to England in 1834, Hugh Miller and other geologists had brought to light the remarkable fossil fish of the Old Red Sandstone of the northeast of Scotland. The strange forms of \"Pterichthys\", \"Coccosteus\" and other genera were then made known to geologists for the first time. They were of intense interest to Agassiz, and formed the subject of a monograph by him published in 1844–45: \"Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Grès Rouge, ou Système Dévonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Îles Britanniques et de Russie\" (\"Monograph on Fossil Fish of the Old Red Sandstone, or Devonian System of the British Isles and of Russia\"). In the early stages of his career in Neuchatel, Agassiz also made a name for himself as a man who could run a scientific department well. Under his care, the University of Neuchâtel soon became a leading institution for scientific inquiry.\n\nIn 1842–1846, Agassiz issued his \"Nomenclator Zoologicus\", a classification list, with references, of all names used in zoological genera and groups.\n\nIn 1837, Agassiz proposed that the Earth had been subjected to a past ice age. He presented the theory to the Helvetic Society that ancient glaciers had not only flowed outward from the Alps, but also even larger glaciers had covered the plains and mountains of Europe, Asia, and North America, smothering the entire Northern Hemisphere in a prolonged ice age. In the same year, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Prior to this proposal, Goethe, de Saussure, Venetz, Jean de Charpentier, Karl Friedrich Schimper, and others had studied the glaciers of the Alps, and Goethe, Charpentier, and Schimper had even concluded that the erratic blocks of alpine rocks scattered over the slopes and summits of the Jura Mountains had been moved there by glaciers. These ideas attracted the attention of Agassiz, and he discussed them with Charpentier and Schimper, whom he accompanied on successive trips to the Alps. Agassiz even had a hut constructed upon one of the Aar Glaciers, which for a time he made his home, to investigate the structure and movements of the ice.\n\nIn 1840, Agassiz published a two-volume work entitled \"Études sur les glaciers\" (\"Studies on Glaciers\"). In this, he discussed the movements of the glaciers, their moraines, their influence in grooving and rounding the rocks, and in producing the striations and \"roches moutonnees\" seen in Alpine-style landscapes. He accepted Charpentier and Schimper's idea that some of the alpine glaciers had extended across the wide plains and valleys of the Aar and Rhône, but he went further, concluding that, in the recent past, Switzerland had been covered with one vast sheet of ice, originating in the higher Alps and extending over the valley of northwestern Switzerland to southern slopes of the Jura. The publication of this work gave fresh impetus to the study of glacial phenomena in all parts of the world.\n\nFamiliar, then, with recent glaciation, Agassiz and English geologist William Buckland visited the mountains of Scotland in 1840. There, they found clear evidence in different locations of glacial action. The discovery was announced to the Geological Society of London in successive communications. The mountainous districts of England, Wales, and Ireland were understood to have been centres for the dispersion of glacial debris. Agassiz remarked, \"that great sheets of ice, resembling those now existing in Greenland, once covered all the countries in which unstratified gravel (boulder drift) is found; that this gravel was in general produced by the trituration of the sheets of ice upon the subjacent surface, etc.\"\nWith the aid of a grant of money from the King of Prussia, Agassiz crossed the Atlantic in the autumn of 1846 to investigate the natural history and geology of North America and to deliver a course of lectures on \"The Plan of Creation as shown in the Animal Kingdom,\" by invitation from J. A. Lowell, at the Lowell Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. The financial offers presented to him in the United States induced him to settle there, where he remained to the end of his life. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846. Agassiz had a cordial relationship with Harvard botanist Asa Gray, but they disagreed on some scientific issues. For example, Agassiz was a member of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities, whereas Gray was a staunch opponent of that group. Agassiz also felt each human race had different origins, but Gray believed in the unity of all humans.\n\nAgassiz's engagement for the Lowell Institute lectures precipitated the establishment, in 1847, of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard University, with Agassiz as its head. Harvard appointed him professor of zoology and geology, and he founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology there in 1859, serving as the museum's first director until his death in 1873. During his tenure at Harvard, Agassiz studied the effect of the last ice age on North America.\n\nAgassiz continued his lectures for the Lowell Institute. In succeeding years, he gave lectures on \"Ichthyology\" (1847–48 season), \"Comparative Embryology\" (1848–49), \"Functions of Life in Lower Animals\" (1850–51), \"Natural History\" (1853–54), \"Methods of Study in Natural History\" (1861–62), \"Glaciers and the Ice Period\" (1864–65), \"Brazil\" (1866–67), and \"Deep Sea Dredging\" (1869–70). In 1850, he married an American college teacher, Elizabeth Cabot Cary, who later wrote introductory books about natural history and a lengthy biography of her husband after he died.\n\nAgassiz served as a nonresident lecturer at Cornell University while also being on faculty at Harvard. In 1852, he accepted a medical professorship of comparative anatomy at Charlestown, Massachusetts, but he resigned in two years. From this time, Agassiz's, scientific studies dropped off, but he became one of the best-known scientists in the world. By 1857, Agassiz was so well-loved that his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote \"The fiftieth birthday of Agassiz\" in his honor, and read it at a dinner given for Agassiz by the Saturday Club in Cambridge. His own writing continued with four (of a planned 10) volumes of \"Natural History of the United States\", published from 1857 to 1862. He also published a catalog of papers in his field, \"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae\", in four volumes between 1848 and 1854.\n\nStricken by ill health in the 1860s, Agassiz resolved to return to the field for relaxation and to resume his studies of Brazilian fish. In April 1865, he led a party to Brazil. Returning home in August 1866, an account of this expedition, entitled \"A Journey in Brazil\", was published in 1868. In December 1871, he made a second eight-month excursion, known as the \"Hassler\" expedition under the command of Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson (brother of Eastman Johnson), visiting South America on its southern Atlantic and Pacific seaboards. The ship explored the Magellan Strait, which drew the praise of Charles Darwin.\n\nElizabeth Agassiz wrote, at the Strait: '. ... .the \"Hassler\" pursued her course, past a seemingly endless panorama of mountains and forests rising into the pale regions of snow and ice, where lay glaciers in which every rift and crevasse, as well as the many cascades flowing down to join the waters beneath, could be counted as she steamed by them. ... These were weeks of exquisite delight to Agassiz. The vessel often skirted the shore so closely that its geology could be studied from the deck.'\n\nFrom his first marriage to Cecilie Bruan, Agassiz had two daughters in addition to son Alexander.\nIn 1863, Agassiz's daughter Ida married Henry Lee Higginson, who later founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra and was a benefactor to Harvard and other schools. On November 30, 1860, Agassiz's daughter Pauline was married to Quincy Adams Shaw (1825–1908), a wealthy Boston merchant and later benefactor to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Agassiz worked to establish a permanent school where zoological science could be pursued amid the living subjects of its study. In 1873, a private philanthropist (John Anderson) gave Agassiz the island of Penikese, in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (south of New Bedford), and presented him with $50,000 to permanently endow it as a practical school of natural science, especially devoted to the study of marine zoology. The John Anderson school collapsed soon after Agassiz's death; it is considered a precursor of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, which is nearby.\n\nAgassiz had a profound influence on the American branches of his two fields, teaching many future scientists who would go on to prominence, including Alpheus Hyatt, David Starr Jordan, Joel Asaph Allen, Joseph Le Conte, Ernest Ingersoll, William James, Nathaniel Shaler, Samuel Hubbard Scudder, Alpheus Packard, and his son Alexander Emanuel Agassiz, among others. He had a profound impact on paleontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott and natural scientist Edward S. Morse. Agassiz had a reputation for being a demanding teacher. He would allegedly \"lock a student up in a room full of turtle-shells, or lobster-shells, or oyster-shells, without a book or a word to help him, and not let him out till he had discovered all the truths which the objects contained.\" Two of Agassiz's most prominent students detailed their personal experiences under his tutelage: Scudder, in a short magazine article for\" Every Saturday\", and Shaler, in his \"Autobiography\". These and other recollections were collected and published by Lane Cooper in 1917, which Ezra Pound was to draw on for his anecdote of Agassiz and the sunfish.\n\nIn the early 1840s, Agassiz named two fossil fish species after Mary Anning —\"Acrodus anningiae\", and \"Belenostomus anningiae\"— and another after her friend, Elizabeth Philpot. Anning was a paleontologist known around the world for important finds, but because of her gender, she was often not formally recognized for her work. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women gave him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.\n\nAgassiz died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1873 and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, joined later by his wife. His monument is a boulder from a glacial moraine of the Aar near the site of the old , not far from the spot where his hut once stood; his grave is sheltered by pine trees from his old home in Switzerland.\n\nThe Cambridge elementary school north of Harvard University was named in his honor and the surrounding neighborhood became known as \"Agassiz\" as a result. The school's name was changed to the Maria L. Baldwin School on May 21, 2002, due to concerns about Agassiz's involvement in scientific racism, and to honor Maria Louise Baldwin the African-American principal of the school, who served from 1889 until 1922. The neighborhood, however, continues to be known as Agassiz. An elementary school called the Agassiz Elementary School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, existed from 1922 to 1981.\n\nAn ancient glacial lake that formed in the Great Lakes region of North America, Lake Agassiz, is named after him, as are Mount Agassiz in California's Palisades, Mount Agassiz, in the Uinta Mountains, Agassiz Peak in Arizona, and in his native Switzerland, the Agassizhorn in the Bernese Alps. Agassiz Glacier (Montana) and Agassiz Creek in Glacier National Park and Agassiz Glacier (Alaska) in Saint Elias Mountains, Mount Agassiz in Bethlehem, New Hampshire in the White Mountains also bear his name. A crater on Mars \"Crater Agassiz\" and a promontorium on the moon are also named in his honor. A headland situated in Palmer Land, Antarctica, is named in his honor, Cape Agassiz. A main-belt asteroid named 2267 Agassiz is also named in association with Louis Agassiz.\n\nSeveral animal species are named in honor of Louis Agassiz, including \"Apistogramma agassizii\" (Agassiz's dwarf cichlid); \"Isocapnia agassizi\" (a stonefly); \"Publius agassizi\" (a passalid beetle); \"Xylocrius agassizi\" (a longhorn beetle); \"Exoprosopa agassizi\" (a bee fly); \"Chelonia agassizii\" (Galápagos green turtle); \"Philodryas agassizii\" (a South American snake); and the most well-known, \"Gopherus agassizii\" (the desert tortoise).\n\nIn 2005, the European Geosciences Union Division on Cryospheric Sciences established the Louis Agassiz Medal, awarded to individuals in recognition of their outstanding scientific contribution to the study of the cryosphere on Earth or elsewhere in the solar system.\n\nAgassiz took part in a monthly gathering called the Saturday Club at the Parker House, a meeting of Boston writers and intellectuals. He was, therefore, mentioned in a stanza of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. poem \"\":\n\nIn 1850 Agassiz commissioned daguerreotypes, described as \"haunting and voyeuristic\" of the enslaved Renty Taylor and Taylor's daughter Delia to further his arguments about black inferiority. They are the earliest known photographs of slaves. Agassiz left the images to Harvard and they remained in the Peabody Museum’s attic until 1976 when they were re-discovered by Ellie Reichlin. In 2019 Taylor's descendants sued Harvard for the return of the images and unspecified damages. The lawsuit was supported by forty-three living descendants of Louis Agassiz, they wrote a letter of support that read in part \"For Harvard to give the daguerreotypes to Ms. Lanier and her family would begin to make amends for its use of the photos as exhibits for the white supremacist theory Agassiz espoused,” and that everyone must evaluate fully \"his role in promoting a pseudoscientific justification for white supremacy.\"\n\nAfter Agassiz came to the United States, he wrote prolifically on polygenism, which holds that animals, plants, and humans were all created in \"special provinces\" with distinct populations of species created in and for each province, and that these populations were endowed with unequal attributes. Agassiz denied that migration and adaptation could account for the geographical age or any of the past. Adaptation takes time; in an example, Agassiz questioned how plants or animals could migrate through regions they were not equipped to handle. According to Agassiz the conditions in which particular creatures live \"are the conditions necessary to their maintenance, and what among organized beings is essential to their temporal existence must be at least one of the conditions under which they were created\". Agassiz was opposed to monogenism and evolution, believing that the theory of evolution reduced the wisdom of God to an impersonal materialism.\n\nAgassiz was influenced by philosophical idealism and the scientific work of Georges Cuvier. Agassiz believed one species of humans exists, but many different creations of races occurred. These ideas are now included under the rubric of scientific racism. According to Agassiz, genera and species were ideas in the mind of God; their existence in God's mind prior to their physical creation meant that God could create humans as one species, yet in several distinct and geographically separate acts of creation. Agassiz was in modern terms a creationist who believed nature had order because God created it directly. Agassiz viewed his career in science as a search for ideas in the mind of the creator expressed in creation.\n\nAgassiz, like other polygenists, believed the Book of Genesis recounted the origin of the white race only and that the animals and plants in the Bible refer only to those species proximate and familiar to Adam and Eve. Agassiz believed that the writers of the Bible only knew of regional events, for example Noah's flood was a local event only known to the regions near those that were populated by ancient Hebrews.\n\nStephen Jay Gould asserted that Agassiz's observations sprang from racist bias, in particular from his revulsion on first encountering African-Americans in the United States. However, others have asserted that, despite favoring polygenism, Agassiz rejected racism and believed in a spiritualized human unity. Agassiz believed God made all men equal, and that intellectualism and morality, as developed in civilization, make men equal before God. Agassiz never supported slavery, and claimed his views on polygenism had nothing to do with politics, however his white supremacist views emboldened proponents of slavery.\n\nAccusations of racism against Agassiz have prompted the renaming of landmarks, schoolhouses, and other institutions (which abound in Massachusetts) that bear his name. Opinions on these events are often mixed, given his extensive scientific legacy in other areas. In 2007, the Swiss government acknowledged his \"racist thinking\", but declined to rename the Agassizhorn summit. In 2017, the Swiss Alpine Club declined to revoke Agassiz's status as a member of honor, which he received in 1865 for his scientific work, because the club considered this status to have lapsed on Agassiz's death.\n\nBULLET::::- \"Recherches sur les poissons fossiles\" (1833–1843)\nBULLET::::- \"History of the Freshwater Fishes of Central Europe\" (1839–1842)\nBULLET::::- \"Études sur les glaciers\" (1840)\nBULLET::::- \"Études critiques sur les mollusques fossiles\" (1840–1845)\nBULLET::::- \"Nomenclator Zoologicus\" (1842–1846)\nBULLET::::- \"Monographie des poissons fossiles du Vieux Gres Rouge, ou Systeme Devonien (Old Red Sandstone) des Iles Britanniques et de Russie\" (1844–1845)\nBULLET::::- \"Bibliographia Zoologiae et Geologiae\" (1848)\nBULLET::::- (with A.

{"id": "18024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18024", "title": "Li Bai", "text": "Li Bai\n\nLi Bai (701–762), also known as Li Bo, courtesy name Taibai, was a Chinese poet acclaimed from his own day to the present as a genius and a romantic figure who took traditional poetic forms to new heights. He and his friend Du Fu (712–770) were the two most prominent figures in the flourishing of Chinese poetry in the Tang dynasty, which is often called the \"Golden Age of Chinese Poetry\". The expression \"Three Wonders\" denote Li Bai's poetry, Pei Min's swordplay, and Zhang Xu's calligraphy.\n\nAround a thousand poems attributed to him are extant. His poems have been collected into the most important Tang dynasty poetry anthology \"Heyue yingling ji\", compiled in 753 by Yin Fan, and thirty-four of his poems are included in the anthology \"Three Hundred Tang Poems\", which was first published in the 18th century. In the same century, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe. The poems were models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking wine. Among the most famous are \"Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day\", \"The Hard Road to Shu\", and \"Quiet Night Thought\", which still appear in school texts in China. In the West, multilingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made. His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness, chivalry, and the well-known fable that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon’s reflection in the river while drunk.\n\nMuch of Li's life is reflected in his poetry: places which he visited, friends whom he saw off on journeys to distant locations perhaps never to meet again, his own dream-like imaginations embroidered with shamanic overtones, current events of which he had news, descriptions taken from nature in a timeless moment of poetry, and so on. However, of particular importance are the changes in the times through which he lived. His early poetry took place in the context of a \"golden age\" of internal peace and prosperity in the Chinese empire of the Tang dynasty, under the reign of an emperor who actively promoted and participated in the arts. This all changed suddenly and shockingly, beginning with the rebellion of the general An Lushan, when all of northern China was devastated by war and famine. Li's poetry as well takes on new tones and qualities. Unlike his younger friend Du Fu, Li did not live to see the quelling of these disorders. However, much of Li's poetry has survived, retaining enduring popularity in China and elsewhere.\n\n!style=\"background:#ccf; border-bottom:1px solid\" colspan=2Names\nalign=rightChinese:\nalign=rightPinyin: Li Bai \"or\" Li Bo\nalign=rightZi ():Taibai (Tai-pai; )\nalign=rightHao ():Qinglian Jushi (Ch'ing-lien Chu-shih; )\nalign=right valign=topaka:Shixian () The Poet Saint Immortal Poet\n\nLi Bai, Li Po, Li Bo, Ri Haku have been all used in the West, but are all written with the same characters. His given name, (白), is romanized by variants such as \"Po\", \"Bo\", \"Bai\", \"Pai\". In Hanyu Pinyin, reflecting modern Mandarin Chinese, the main, colloquial equivalent for this character is \"Bái\"; \"Bó\" is the literary variant and is commonly used. The reconstructed version of how he and others during the Tang dynasty would have pronounced this is \"Bhæk\". His courtesy name was Taibai (太白), literally \"Great White,\" as the planet Venus was called at the time. Thus, combining the family name with the courtesy name, his name appears in variants such as \"Li Taibo\", \"Li Taibai\", \"Li Tai-po\", among others.\n\nHe is also known by his (\"hao\"), or pen-name \"Qīnglián Jūshì\" (青蓮居士), meaning \"Householder of Azure Lotus\" (that is, Qianlian town), or by nicknames \"Immortal Poet\" (Poet Transcendent; Wine Immortal (), Banished Transcendent (), Poet-Knight-errant (, or \"Poet-Hero\"). The Japanese pronunciation may be romanized as \"Ri Haku\"or \"Ri Taihaku\".\n\nThe two \"Books of Tang\", \"The Old Book of Tang\" and \"The New Book of Tang\", remain the primary sources of bibliographical material on Li Bai. Other sources include internal evidence from poems by or about Li Bai, and certain other sources, such the preface to his collected poems by his relative and literary executor, Li Yangbin.\n\nLi Bai is generally considered to have been born in 701, in Suyab (碎葉) of ancient Chinese Central Asia (present-day Kyrgyzstan), where his family had prospered in business at the frontier. Afterwards, the family under the leadership of his father, Li Ke (李客), moved to Jiangyou (江油), near modern Chengdu, in Sichuan province, when the youngster was about five years old. There is some mystery or uncertainty about the circumstances of the family relocations, due to a lack of legal authorization which would have generally been required to move out of the border regions, especially if one's family had been assigned (exiled) there.\n\nTwo accounts given by contemporaries Li Yangbing (a family relative) and Fan Chuanzheng state that Li's family was originally from what is now southwestern Jingning County, Gansu. Li's ancestry is traditionally traced back to Li Gao, the noble founder of the state of Western Liang. This provides some support for Li's own claim to be related to the Li dynastic royal family of the Tang dynasty: the Tang emperors also claimed descent from the Li rulers of West Liang. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (隴西李氏). Evidence suggests that during the Sui dynasty, Li's own ancestors, at that time for some reason classified socially as commoners, were forced into a form of exile from their original home (in what is now Gansu) to some location or locations further west. During their exile in the far west, the Li family lived in the ancient Silk Road city of Suiye (Suyab, now an archeological site in present-day Kyrgyzstan, and perhaps also in Tiaozhi (), a state near modern Ghazni, Afghanistan. These areas were on the ancient Silk Road, and the Li family were likely merchants. Their business was quite prosperous.\n\nIn one hagiographic account, while Li Bai's mother was pregnant with him, she had a dream of a great white star falling from heaven. This seems to have contributed to the idea of his being a banished immortal (one of his nicknames). That the Great White Star was synonymous with Venus helps to explain his courtesy name: \"Tai Bai\", or \"Venus\".\n\nLi is known to have married four times. His first marriage, in 727, was to the granddaughter of a former government minister. In 744, he married for the second time in what now is the Liangyuan District of Henan. This marriage was to another poet, surnamed Zong (宗), with whom he both had children and exchanges of poems, including many expressions of love for her and their children. His wife, Zong, was a granddaughter of Zong Chuke (宗楚客, died 710), an important government official during the Tang dynasty and the interegnal period of Wu Zetian.\n\nIn 705, when Li Bai was four years old, his father secretly moved his family to Sichuan, near Chengdu, where he spent his childhood. There is currently a monument commemorating this in Zhongba Town, Jiangyou, Sichuan province (the area of the modern province then being known as Shu, after a former independent state which had been annexed by the Sui dynasty and later incorporated into the Tang dynasty lands). The young Li spent most of his growing years in Qinglian (青莲; lit. \"Blue [also translated as 'green', 'azure', or 'nature-coloured'] Lotus\"), a town in Chang-ming County, Sichuan, China. This now nominally corresponds with Qinglian Town (青蓮鎮) of Jiangyou County-level city, in Sichuan Province.\n\nThe young Li read extensively, including Confucian classics such as \"The Classic of Poetry (Shijing)\" and the \"Classic of History (Shujing)\", as well as various astrological and metaphysical materials which Confucians tended to eschew though he disdained to take the literacy exam. Reading the \"Hundred Authors\" was part of the family literary tradition, and he was also able to compose poetry before he was ten. The young Li also engaged in other activities, such as taming wild birds and fencing. His other activities included riding, hunting, traveling, and aiding the poor or oppressed by means of both money and arms. Eventually, the young Li seems to have become quite skilled in swordsmanship; as this autobiographical quote by Li himself both testifies to and also helps to illustrate the wild life that he led in the Sichuan of his youth:\n\nBefore he was twenty, Li had fought and killed several men, apparently for reasons of chivalry, in accordance with the knight-errant tradition (\"youxia\").\n\nIn 720, he was interviewed by Governor Su Ting, who considered him a genius. Though he expressed the wish to become an official, he never took the civil service examination.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, about 725, Li Bai left Sichuan, sailing down the Yangzi River through Dongting Lake to Nanjing, beginning his days of wandering. He then went back up-river, to Yunmeng, in what is now Hubei, where his marriage to the granddaughter of a retired prime minister, Xu Yushi, seems to have formed but a brief interlude. During the first year of his trip, he met celebrities and gave away much of his wealth to needy friends.\n\nIn 730, Li Bai stayed at Zhongnan Mountain near the capital Chang'an (Xi'an), and tried but failed to secure a position. He sailed down the Yellow River, stopped by Luoyang, and visited Taiyuan before going home. In 735, Li Bai was in Shanxi, where he intervened in a court martial against Guo Ziyi, who was later, after becoming one of the top Tang generals, to repay the favour during the An Shi disturbances. By perhaps 740, he had moved to Shandong. It was in Shandong at this time that he became one of the group known as the \"Six Idlers of the Bamboo Brook\", an informal group dedicated to literature and wine. He wandered about the area of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, eventually making friends with a famous Daoist priest, Wu Yun. In 742, Wu Yun was summoned by the Emperor to attend the imperial court, where his praise of Li Bai was great.\n\nWu Yun's praise of Li Bai led Emperor Xuanzong (born Li Longji and also known as Emperor Minghuang) to summon Li to the court in Chang'an. Li's personality fascinated the aristocrats and common people alike, including another Taoist (and poet), He Zhizhang, who bestowed upon him the nickname the \"Immortal Exiled from Heaven\". Indeed, after an initial audience, where Li Bai was questioned about his political views, the Emperor was so impressed that he held a big banquet in his honor. At this banquet, the Emperor was said to show his favor, even to the extent of personally seasoning his soup for him.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong employed him as a translator, as Li Bai knew at least one non-Chinese language. Ming Huang eventually gave him a post at the Hanlin Academy, which served to provide scholarly expertise and poetry for the Emperor.\n\nWhen the emperor ordered Li Bai to the palace, he was often drunk, but quite capable of performing on the spot.\n\nLi Bai wrote several poems about the Emperor's beautiful and beloved Yang Guifei, the favorite royal consort. A story, probably apocryphal, circulates about Li Bai during this period. Once, while drunk, Li Bai had gotten his boots muddy, and Gao Lishi, the most politically powerful eunuch in the palace, was asked to assist in the removal of these, in front of the Emperor. Gao took offense at being asked to perform this menial service, and later managed to persuade Yang Guifei to take offense at Li's poems concerning her. At the persuasion of Yang Guifei and Gao Lishi, Xuanzong reluctantly, but politely, and with large gifts of gold and silver, sent Li Bai away from the royal court. After leaving the court, Li Bai formally became a Taoist, making a home in Shandong, but wandering far and wide for the next ten some years, writing poems. Li Bai lived and wrote poems at Bishan (or Bi Mountain (碧山), today Baizhao Mountain (白兆山)) in Yandian, Hubei. Bi Mountain (碧山) in the poem \"Question and Answer Amongst the Mountains\" (山中问答 Shanzhong Wenda) refers to this mountain.\n\nHe met Du Fu in the autumn of 744, when they shared a single room and various activities together, such as traveling, hunting, wine, and poetry, thus established a close and lasting friendship. They met again the following year. These were the only occasions on which they met, in person, although they continued to maintain a relationship through poetry. This is reflected in the dozen or so Du Fu poems to or about Li Bai, which survive, and the one from Li Bai directed toward Du Fu which remains.\n\nAt the end of 755, the disorders instigated by the rebel general An Lushan burst across the land. The Emperor eventually fled to Sichuan and abdicated. During the confusion, the Crown Prince opportunely declared himself Emperor and head of the government. The An Shi disturbances continued (as they were later called, since they lasted beyond the death of their instigator, carried on by Shi Siming, and others). Li Bai became a staff adviser to Prince Yong, one of Ming Huang's (Emperor Xuanzong's) sons, who was far from the top of the primogeniture list, yet named to share the imperial power as a general after Xuanzong had abdicated, in 756.\n\nHowever, even before the empire's external enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies. Upon the defeat of the Prince's forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in Jiujiang, and sentenced to death. The famous and powerful army general Guo Ziyi and others intervened; Guo Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before. His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency. Upon General Guo Ziyi's offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai's life, Li Bai's death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to Yelang. Yelang (in what is now Guizhou) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture. Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity. Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him before he even got near Yelang. He had only gotten as far as Wushan, when news of his pardon caught up with him in 759.\n\nWhen Li received the news of his imperial reprieve, he returned down the river to Jiangxi, passing on the way through Baidicheng, in Kuizhou Prefecture, still engaging in the pleasures of food, wine, good company, and writing poetry; his poem \"\" records this stage of his travels, as well as poetically mocking his enemies and detractors, implied in his inclusion of imagery of monkeys. Although Li did not cease his wandering lifestyle, he then generally confined his travels to Nanjing and the two Anhui cities of Xuancheng and Li Yang (in modern Zhao County). His poems of this time include nature poems and poems of socio-political protest. Eventually, in 762, Li's relative Li Yangbing became magistrate of Dangtu, and Li Bai went to stay with him there. In the meantime, Suzong and Xuanzong both died within a short period of time, and China had a new emperor. Also, China was involved in renewed efforts to suppress further military disorders stemming from the Anshi rebellions, and Li volunteered to serve on the general staff of the Chinese commander Li Guangbi. However, at age 61, Li became critically ill, and his health would not allow him to fulfill this plan.\n\nThe new Emperor Daizong named Li Bai the Registrar of the Left Commandant's office in 762. However, by the time that the imperial edict arrived in Dangtu, Anhui, Li Bai was already dead.\n\nThere is a long and sometimes fanciful tradition regarding his death, from uncertain Chinese sources, that Li Bai drowned after falling from his boat one day he had gotten very drunk as he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon in the Yangtze River, something later believed by Herbert Giles. However, the actual cause appears to have been natural enough, although perhaps related to his hard-living lifestyle. Nevertheless, the legend has a place in Chinese culture.\n\nA memorial of Li Bai lies just west of Ma'anshan.\n\nLi Bai was also a skilled calligrapher, though there is only one surviving piece of his work in his own handwriting that exists today. The piece is titled \"Shangyangtai\" (\"Going Up To Sun Terrace\"), a long scroll (with later addition of a title written by Emperor Huizong of Song and a postscript added by Qianlong Emperor himself); the calligraphy is housed in the Palace Museum in Beijing, China.\n\nEven Li Bai and Du Fu, the two most famous and most comprehensively edited Tang poets, were affected by the destruction of the imperial Tang libraries and the loss of many private collections in the periods of turmoil (An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion). Although many of Li Bai's poems have survived, even more were lost and there is difficulty regarding variant texts. One of the earliest endeavors at editing Li Bai's work was by his relative Li Yangbing, the magistrate of Dangtu, with whom he stayed in his final years and to whom he entrusted his manuscripts. However, the most reliable texts are not necessarily in the earliest editions. Song dynasty scholars produced various editions of his poetry, but it was not until the Qing dynasty that such collections as the \"Quan Tangshi\" (\"Complete Tang Poems\") made the most comprehensive studies of the then surviving texts.\n\nCritics have focused on Li Bai's strong sense of the continuity of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes of some of his imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules—and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly effortless virtuosity in order to produce inimitable poetry. Other themes in Li's poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common folks and antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself).\n\nLi Bai had a strong sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition. The \"genius\" of Li Bai, says one recent account, \"lies at once in his total command of the literary tradition before him and his ingenuity in bending (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom...\" Burton Watson, comparing him to Du Fu, says Li's poetry, \"is essentially backward-looking, that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future.\" Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of \"yuefu\", or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads. As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled \"Gu Feng\", or \"In the Old Manner\", which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties. His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to Qu Yuan or Tao Yuanming, and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu.\n\nA more general appreciation for history, is shown on the part of Li Bai in his poems of the \"huaigu\" genre, or meditations on the past, wherein following \"one of the perennial themes of Chinese poetry\", \"the poet contemplates the ruins of past glory\".\n\nJohn C. H. Wu observed that \"while some may have drunk more wine than Li [Bai], no-one has written more poems about wine.\" Classical Chinese poets were often associated with drinking wine, and Li Bai was part of the group of Chinese scholars in Chang'an his fellow poet Du Fu called the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup.\" The Chinese generally did not find the moderate use of alcohol to be immoral or unhealthy. James J. Y Liu comments that \"zui\" in poetry \"does not mean quite the same thing as 'drunk', 'intoxicated', or 'inebriated', but rather means being mentally carried away from one's normal preoccupations ...\" Liu translates \"zui\" as \"rapt with wine\". The \"Eight Immortals\", however, drank to an unusual degree, though they still were viewed as pleasant eccentrics. Burton Watson concluded that \"[n]early all Chinese poets celebrate the joys of wine, but none so tirelessly and with such a note of genuine conviction as Li [Bai]\".\n\nOne of Li Bai's most famous poems is \"Waking From Drunkenness on a Spring Day\" (). Arthur Waley translated it as follows:\n\nAn important characteristic of Li Bai's poetry \"is the fantasy and note of childlike wonder and playfulness that pervade so much of it\". Burton Watson attributes this to a fascination with the Taoist priest, Taoist recluses who practiced alchemy and austerities in the mountains, in the aim of becoming xian, or immortal beings. There is a strong element of Taoism in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone, and \"many of his poems deal with mountains, often descriptions of ascents that midway modulate into journeys of the imagination, passing from actual mountain scenery to visions of nature deities, immortals, and 'jade maidens' of Taoist lore\". Watson sees this as another affirmation of Li Bai's affinity with the past, and a continuity with the traditions of the Chuci and the early fu. Watson finds this \"element of fantasy\" to be behind Li Bai's use of hyperbole and the \"playful personifications\" of mountains and celestial objects.\n\nThe critic James J.Y. Liu notes “Chinese poets seem to be perpetually bewailing their exile and longing to return home. This may seem sentimental to Western readers, but one should remember the vastness of China, the difficulties of communication... the sharp contrast between the highly cultured life in the main cities and the harsh conditions in the remoter regions of the country, and the importance of family...” It is hardly surprising, he concludes, that nostalgia should have become a \"constant, and hence conventional, theme in Chinese poetry.\"\n\nLiu gives as a prime example Li's poem \"A Quiet Night Thought\" (also translated as \"Contemplating Moonlight\"), which is often learned by schoolchildren in China. In a mere 20 words, the poem uses the vivid moonlight and frost imagery to convey the feeling of homesickness. There are several editions of the poem. This is translated from a 17th-century Kangxi edition moonlight poem:\n\nThe following version has been translated by Jarek Zawadzki from the Gujin Tushu Jicheng edition:\n\nLi Bai also wrote a number of poems from various viewpoints, including the personae of women. For example, he wrote several poems in the \"Zi Ye\", or \"Lady Midnight\" style, as well as Han folk-ballad style poems.\n\nLi Bai is well known for the technical virtuosity of his poetry and the mastery of his verses. In terms of poetic form, \"critics generally agree that Li [Bai] produced no significant innovations ... In theme and content also, his poetry is notable less for the new elements it introduces than for the skill with which he brightens the old ones.\"\n\nBurton Watson comments on Li Bai's famous poem, which he translates \"Bring the Wine\": \"like so much of Li [Bai]'s work, it has a grace and effortless dignity that somehow make it more compelling than earlier treatment of the same.\"\n\nLi Bai's yuefu poems have been called the greatest of all time by Ming-dynasty scholar and writer Hu Yinglin.\n\nLi Bai especially excelled in the Gushi form, or \"old style\" poems, a type of poetry allowing a great deal of freedom in terms of the form and content of the work. An example is his poem \"蜀道難\", translated by Witter Bynner as \"Hard Roads in Shu\". Shu is a poetic term for Sichuan, the destination of refuge that Emperor Xuanzong considered fleeing to escape the approaching forces of the rebel General An Lushan. Watson comments that, this poem, \"employs lines that range in length from four to eleven characters, the form of the lines suggesting by their irregularity the jagged peaks and bumpy mountain roads of Sichuan depicted in the poem.\"\n\nLi Bai was also noted as a master of the Jueju, or cut-verse. Ming-dynasty poet Li Pan Long thought Li Bai was the greatest jueju master of the Tang dynasty.\n\nLi Bai was noted for his mastery of the Lüshi (poetry), or \"regulated verse\", the formally most demanding verse form of the times. Watson notes, however, that his poem \"Seeing a Friend Off\" was \"unusual in that it violates the rule that the two middle couplets ... must observe verbal parallelism\", adding that Chinese critics excused this kind of violation in the case of a genius like Li.\n\nLi Bai's poetry was immensely influential in his own time, as well as for subsequent generations in China. From early on, he was paired with Du Fu. The recent scholar Paula Varsano observes that \"in the literary imagination they were, and remain, the two greatest poets of the Tang—or even of China\". Yet she notes the persistence of \"what we can rightly call the 'Li-Du debate', the terms of which became so deeply ingrained in the critical discourse surrounding these two poets that almost any characterization of the one implicitly critiqued the other\". Li's influence has also been demonstrated in the immediate geographical area of Chinese cultural influence, being known as Ri Haku in Japan. This influence continues even today. Examples range from poetry to painting and to literature.\n\nIn his own lifetime, during his many wanderings and while he was attending court in Chang'an, he met and parted from various contemporary poets. These meetings and separations were typical occasions for versification in the tradition of the literate Chinese of the time, a prime example being his relationship with Du Fu.\n\nAfter his lifetime, his influence continued to grow. Some four centuries later, during the Song dynasty, for example, just in the case of his poem that is sometimes translated \"Drinking Alone Beneath the Moon\", the poet Yang Wanli wrote a whole poem alluding to it (and to two other Li Bai poems), in the same \"gushi\", or old-style poetry form.\n\nIn the 20th century, Li Bai even influenced the poetry of Mao Zedong.\n\nIn China, his poem \"Quiet Night Thoughts\", reflecting a nostalgia of a traveller away from home, has been widely \"memorized by school children and quoted by adults\".\n\nThere is another musical setting of Li Bai's verse by the American composer Harry Partch, whose \"Seventeen Lyrics by Li Po\" for intoning voice and Adapted Viola (an instrument of Partch's own invention) are based on the texts in \"The Works of Li Po, the Chinese Poet\" translated by Shigeyoshi Obata. In Brazil, the songwriter Beto Furquim included a musical setting of the poem \"Jing Ye Si\" in his album \"Muito Prazer\".\n\nLi Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound's versions of some of his poems in the collection \"\"Cathay\"\", (Pound transliterating his name according to the Japanese manner as \"Rihaku\"). Li Bai's interactions with nature, friendship, his love of wine and his acute observations of life inform his more popular poems. Some, like \"Changgan xing\" (translated by Ezra Pound as ), record the hardships or emotions of common people. An example of the liberal, but poetically influential, translations, or adaptations, of Japanese versions of his poems made, largely based on the work of Ernest Fenollosa and professors Mori and Ariga.\n\nThe ideas underlying Li Bai's poetry had a profound impact in shaping American Imagist and Modernist poetry through the 20th century. Also, Gustav Mahler integrated four of Li Bai's works into his symphonic song cycle \"Das Lied von der Erde\". These were derived from free German translations by Hans Bethge, published in an anthology called (\"The Chinese Flute\"), Bethge based his versions on the collection \"Chinesische Lyrik\" by Hans Heilmann (1905). Heilmann worked from pioneering 19th-century translations into French: three by the Marquis d'Hervey-Saint-Denys and one (only distantly related to the Chinese) by Judith Gautier. Mahler freely changed Bethge's text.\n\nLi Bai's poetry can be seen as being an influence to Beat Generation writer Gary Snyder during Snyder's years of studying Asian Culture and Zen. Bai's style of descriptive writing assisted in the diversity within the Beat writing style. As well as D.T. Suzuki being a big influence on Snyder's writing and life.\n\nLi Bai's poetry was introduced to Europe by Jean Joseph Marie Amiot, a Jesuit missionary in Beijing, in his \"Portraits des Célèbres Chinois\", published in the series \"Mémoires concernant l'histoire, les sciences, les arts, les mœurs, les usages, &c. des Chinois, par les missionnaires de Pekin\". (1776–1797). Further translations into French were published by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his 1862 \"Poésies de l'Époque des Thang\".\n\nJoseph Edkins read a paper, \"On Li Tai-po\", to the Peking Oriental Society in 1888, which was subsequently published in that society's journal. The early sinologist Herbert Allen Giles included translations of Li Bai in his 1898 publication \"Chinese Poetry in English Verse\", and again in his \"History of Chinese Literature\" (1901). The third early translator into English was L. Cranmer-Byng (1872–1945). His \"Lute of Jade: Being Selections from the Classical Poets of China\" (1909) and \"A Feast of Lanterns\" (1916) both featured Li's poetry.\n\nRenditions of Li Bai's poetry into modernist English poetry were influential through Ezra Pound in \"Cathay\" (1915) and Amy Lowell in \"Fir-Flower Tablets\" (1921). Neither worked directly from the Chinese: Pound relied on more or less literal, word for word, though not terribly accurate, translations of Ernest Fenollosa and what Pound called the \"decipherings\" of professors Mori and Ariga; Lowell on those of Florence Ayscough. Witter Bynner with the help of Kiang Kang-hu included several of Li's poems in \"The Jade Mountain\" (1939). Although Li was not his preferred poet, Arthur Waley translated a few of his poems into English for the \"Asiatic Review\", and included them in his \"More Translations from the Chinese\". Shigeyoshi Obata, in his 1922 \"The Works of Li Po\", claimed he had made \"the first attempt ever made to deal with any single Chinese poet exclusively in one book for the purpose of introducing him to the English-speaking world. A translation of Li Bai's poem \"Green Moss\" by poet William Carlos Williams was sent as a letter to Chinese American poet David Rafael Wang where Williams was seen as having a similar tone as Pound.\n\nLi Bai became a favorite among translators for his straightforward and seemingly simple style. Later translations are too numerous to discuss here, but an extensive selection of Li's poems, translated by various translators, is included in John Minford and Joseph S. M. Lau, \"Classical Chinese Literature\" (2000)\n\nOne of Li Bai's best known poems and a good example of his writing is his \"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\" (, pinyin: Yuè Xià Dú Zhuó), which has been translated into English by various authors, including this translation, by Arthur Waley:\n\nTo hear the poem read in Chinese and to see another translation, go to Great Tang Poets: Li Bo (701–762) \"Drinking Alone under the Moon\" Asia For Educators (Columbia University)\n\nBULLET::::- An actor playing Li Bai narrates the Wonders of China and Reflections of China films at the China Pavillion at EPCOT\n\nBULLET::::- Chinese martial arts\nBULLET::::- Ci (poetry)\nBULLET::::- Classical Chinese poetry\nBULLET::::- Classical Chinese poetry forms\nBULLET::::- Guqin\nBULLET::::- Jiangyou\nBULLET::::- Modernist poetry in English\nBULLET::::- Monkeys in Chinese culture#Literature\nBULLET::::- Poetry of Mao Zedong\nBULLET::::- Shi (poetry)\nBULLET::::- Simians (Chinese poetry)#In Baidicheng, back from the way to exile\nBULLET::::- Tang poetry\nBULLET::::- List of Three Hundred Tang Poems poets\nBULLET::::- Xu Yushi\nBULLET::::- A Quiet Night Thought\nBULLET::::- Cooper, Arthur (1973). \"Li Po and Tu Fu: Poems Selected and Translated with an Introduction and Notes\" (Penguin Classics, 1973). .\nBULLET::::- Hinton, David (2008). \"Classical Chinese Poetry: An Anthology\".

{"id": "18025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18025", "title": "Longship", "text": "Longship\n\nLongships were a type of specialised Viking warships that have a long history in Scandinavia, with their existence being archaeologically proven and documented from at least the fourth century BC. Originally invented and used by the Norsemen (commonly known as the Vikings) for commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age, many of the longship's characteristics were adopted by other cultures, like Anglo-Saxons and continued to influence shipbuilding for centuries. The longship's design evolved over many centuries, beginning in the Stone Age with the invention of the umiak and continuing up until the 6th century with clinker-built ships like Nydam and Kvalsund. The longship appeared in its complete form between the 9th and 13th centuries. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boat-building traditions until today. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool) and had numerous details and carvings on the hull.\n\nThe longships were characterized as a graceful, long, wide and light, with a shallow-draft hull designed for speed. The ship's shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted arbitrary beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages or used bottom-up for shelter in camps. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without a turn around; this trait proved particularly useful at northern latitudes, where icebergs and sea ice posed hazards to navigation. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions had a rectangular sail on a single mast, which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship, but lay in the range of and the maximum speed of a longship under favourable conditions was around .\n\nThe Viking longships were the type of naval power in their time and were highly valued possessions. Archaeological finds show that the Viking ships were by no means a standard type vessel. It demonstrated true individual designs with its designers' footprints and often had regional characteristics. For example, the choice of material was mostly dictated by the regional forests, that is pine from Norway and Sweden, and oak from Denmark. Moreover,  each and every one of these Viking longships had particular features adjusted to the natural conditions, which they were exposed to.\n\nThey were often communally owned by coastal farmers and commissioned by kings in times of conflict, in order to quickly assemble a large and powerful naval force. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used as troop transports, not warships. In the tenth century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. During the 9th century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the degrading Frankish empire by attacking up navigable rivers such as the Seine. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern Etables, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack up the Seine. They were called \"dragonships\" by enemies such as the English because they had a dragon-shaped bow. The Norse had a strong sense of naval architecture, and during the early medieval period they were advanced for their time.\n\nLongships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board.\n\nThe Karvi (or \"karve\") is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship. According to the 10th-century Gulating Law, a ship with 13 rowing benches is the smallest ship suitable for military use. A ship with 6 to 16 benches would be classified as a Karvi. These ships were considered to be \"general purpose\" ships, mainly used for fishing and trade, but occasionally commissioned for military use. While most longships held a length to width ratio of 7:1, the Karvi ships were closer to 4.5:1. \nThe Gokstad Ship is a famous Karvi ship, built around the end of the 9th century, excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen. It was approximately long with 16 rowing positions.\n\nThe \"\" (or \"snekke\"), meaning \"snakes\", because the ships were long and sleek, were typically the smallest longship used in warfare and was classified as a ship with at least 20 rowing benches. A typical snekkja might have a length of , a width of , and a draught of only . It would carry a crew of around 41 men (40 oarsmen and one cox).\n\nSnekkjas were one of the most common types of ship. According to Viking lore, Canute the Great used 1,200 in Norway in 1028.\n\nThe Norwegian snekkjas, designed for deep fjords and Atlantic weather, typically had more draught than the Danish model designed for low coasts and beaches. Snekkjas were so light that they had no need of ports—they could simply be beached, and potentially even carried across a portage.\n\nThe snekkjas continued to evolve after the end of the Viking age, with later Norwegian examples becoming larger and heavier than Viking age ships. A modern version is still being used in Norway, and are now called \"\".\n\n\"Skeid\" (\"skeið\"), meaning ‘slider’ (referring to a sley, a weavers reed, or to a sheath that a knife slides into) and probably connoting ‘speeder’ (referring to a running race) (Zoega, Old Icelandic Dictionary). These ships were larger warships, consisting of more than 30 rowing benches. Ships of this classification are some of the largest (see Busse) longships ever discovered. A group of these ships were discovered by Danish archaeologists in Roskilde during development in the harbour-area in 1962 and 1996–97. The ship discovered in 1962, \"Skuldelev 2\" is an oak-built Skeid longship. It is believed to have been built in the Dublin area around 1042. \"Skuldelev 2\" could carry a crew of some 70–80 and measures just less than in length. They had around 30 rowing chairs. In 1996–97 archaeologists discovered the remains of another ship in the harbour. This ship, called the \"Roskilde 6\", at is the longest Viking ship ever discovered and has been dated to around 1025. \"Skuldelev 2\" was replicated as \"Seastallion from Glendalough\" at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde and launched in 2004. In 2012, a 35-metre long skeid longship named \"Draken Harald Hårfagre\" was launched in Norway. It was built from scratch by experts, using original Viking and experimental archaeological methods.\n\"Drakkar\", or \"dreki\" \"\"'dragon' are the type of ship, of thirty rowing benches and upwards that are only known from historical sources, such as the 13th-century \"Göngu-Hrólfs saga\" . Here, the ships are described as most unusual, elegant, ornately decorated, and used by those who went raiding and plundering. These ships were likely skeids that differed only in the carvings of menacing beasts, such as dragons and snakes, carried on the prow of the ship. These carvings allegedly protected the ship and crew, and warded off the terrible sea monsters of Norse mythology. It is however likely that the carvings, like those on the Oseberg ship, might have had a ritual purpose, or that the purported effect was to frighten enemies and townspeople.\n\nThe earliest mentioned Drakkar was possibly the ship of unstated size owned by Harald Fairhair in the tenth century. The first drakkar ship whose size was mentioned in the source was Olav Tryggvason's thirty-room Tranin, built at Nidaros in apex. 995. By far the most famous in this period was his later ship the Ormrinn Langi ('Long Serpent') of thirty-four rooms, built over the winter of 999 to 1000. No true dragon ship, as defined by the sagas, has been found by archaeological excavation.\n\nThe visual representation of how the Drakkar ship could have looked can be found on the Bergen seal from 1299 shows a ship with a dragonhead at either end, as do several of the ships on Viking Age.\n\nThe first longships can trace their origin back to between 500 and 300 BC, when the Danish Hjortspring boat was built. It was fastened with cord, not nailed, and paddled, not rowed. It had rounded cross sections and although long was only wide. The rounded sections gave maximum displacement for the lowest wetted surface area, similar to a modern narrow rowing skiff, so were very fast but had little carrying capacity. The shape suggests mainly river use. Unlike later boats, it had a low bow and stern. A distinctive feature is the two-prong cutaway bow section.\nThe first true longship that was rowed was the Nydam ship, built in Denmark around 350 AD. It also had very rounded underwater sections but had more pronounced flare in the topsides, giving it more stability as well as keeping more water out of the boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern had slight elevation. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo longship, sometimes referred to as the ghost ship of the Wulflings, is about maximum beam and built about 625 AD. It is associated with the Saxons. The ship was crushed by the weight of soil when buried but most details have been reconstructed. The ship was similar in hull section to the Nydam ship with flared topsides. Compared to later longships, the oak planks are wide—about including laps, with less taper at bow and stern. Planks were thick. The 26 heavy frames are spaced at in the centre. Each frame tapers from the turn of the bilge to the inwale. This suggests that knees were used to brace the upper two or three topside planks but have rotted away. The hull had a distinctive leaf shape with the bow sections much narrower than the stern quarters. There were nine wide planks per side. The ship had a light keel plank but pronounced stem and stern deadwood. The reconstruction suggests the stern was much lower than the bow. It had a steering oar to starboard braced by an extra frame. The raised prow extended about above the keel and the hull was estimated to draw when lightly laden. Between each futtock the planks were lapped in normal clinker style and fastened with six iron rivets per plank. There is no evidence of a mast, sail, or strengthening of the keel amidships but a half-sized replica, the Soe Wylfing, sailed very well with a modest sail area.\n\nSails started to be used from possibly the 8th century. The earliest had either plaited or chequered pattern, with narrow strips sewn together.\n\nAbout 700 AD the Kvalsund ship was built. It is the first with a true keel. Its cross sectional shape was flatter on the bottom with less flare to the topsides. This shape is far more stable and able to handle rougher seas. It had the high prow of the later longships. After several centuries of evolution, the fully developed longship emerged some time in the middle of the ninth century. Its long, graceful, menacing head figure carved in the stern, such as the Oseburg ship, echoed the designs of its predecessors. The mast was now square in section and located toward the middle of the ship, and could be lowered and raised. The hull's sides were fastened together to allow it to flex with the waves, combining lightness and ease of handling on land. The ships were large enough to carry cargo and passengers on long ocean voyages, but still maintained speed and agility, making the longship a versatile warship and cargo carrier.\n\nThe Viking shipbuilders had no written diagrams or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder pictured the longship before its construction, based on previous builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel was made up of several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes—the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about . The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles to the surface of the plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the \"meginhufr\", was about thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. Amidships, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.\n\nAs the planks reached the desired height, the interior frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, which is an enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about . Part of the reason for this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about of iron nails in a long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard () of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.\n\nThe longship's narrow deep keel provided strength beneath the waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was amidships, tapering in width at the bow and stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened to the top of the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. Evidence of small scale domestic tar production dates from between 100 AD and 400 AD. Larger industrial scale tar pits, estimated to be capable of producing up to 300 litres of tar in a single firing have been dated to between 680 AD and 900 AD. A drain plug hole about was drilled in the garboard plank on one side to allow rain water drainage.\n\nThe oars did not use rowlocks or thole pins but holes cut below the gunwale line. To keep seawater out, these oar holes were sealed with wooden disks from the inside, when the oars were not in use. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper futtock protruded about above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.\n\nAnalysis of timber samples from Viking long boats shows that a variety of timbers were used, but there was strong preference for oak, a tree associated with Thor in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was wide and long with a neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The Domesday Book in England (1086 AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.\n\nEven though no longship sail has been found, accounts and depictions verify that longships had square sails. Sails measured perhaps across, and were made of rough wool cloth. Unlike in knarrs, a longship sail was not stitched.\n\nThe sail was held in place by the mast which was up to tall. Its base was about . The mast was supported by a large wooden maststep called a \"kerling\" (\"old woman\" in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about wide and up to long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal keelson, although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the \"mast fish,\" a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about long with a slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to catch and secure the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish-the mast partner is an athwartwise beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.\n\nThere is a suggestion that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped at an angle to aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each side stay was fitted at it lower end with a toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side stay consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About four turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v-shape at the bottom of the angels \"wings\" jambed the stay preventing slippage and movement.\n\nEarly long boats used some form of steering oar but by the 10th century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word starboard itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about . The lower blade was about . The steerboard on the Gokstad ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about wide, completely flat inboard and with about a maximum width at the center of the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about in diameter and high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.\n\nLongships for the most part used two different kinds of anchors. The most common was a natural wood yoke formed from a tree branch. The weight was supplied by a stone passing laterally through the U of the yoke. The top of the yoke was closed by either a length of hardwood or a curved iron head, which kept the stone in place. One side of the head stuck out so it could dig into mud or sand. In the Ladby ship burial in Denmark, a unique iron anchor has been found, resembling the modern fisherman's anchor but without the crossbar. The cross bar may have rusted away. This anchor—made of Norwegian iron—has a long iron chain to which the hemp warp was attached. This construction has several advantages when anchored in deep waters or in rough seas.\n\nAt the height of Viking expansion into Dublin and Jorvik 875–954 AD the longship reached a peak of development such as the Gokstad ship 890. Archaeological discoveries from this period at Coppergate, York, show the shipwright had a large range of sophisticated woodwork tools. As well as the heavy adze, broad axe, wooden mallets and wedges, the craftsman had steel tools such as anvils, files, snips, awls, augers, gouges, draw knife, knives, including folding knives, chisels and small long bow saws with antler handles. Edged tools were kept sharp with sharpening stones from Norway. One of the most sophisticated tools was a diameter twist drill bit, perfect for drilling holes for treenails. Simple mechanical pole wood lathes were used to make cups and bowls.\n\nSince the discovery of the original longships in the 1800s, many boat builders have built Viking ship replicas. However, most have not been able to resist the temptation to use more modern techniques and tools in the construction process. In 1892–93, a full-size near-replica of the Gokstad ship, the Viking, was built by the Norwegian Magnus Andersen in Bergen. It was used to sail the Atlantic. It had a deeper keel with draught to stiffen the hull and a range of non-authentic triangular sails to help performance and big fenders on each gunwale filled with reindeer hair to give extra buoyancy in case of swamping. The skipper recorded that the keel bowed upwards as much as and the gunwale flexed inwards as much as in heavy seas. A half-size replica of the Sutton Hoo longship has been equipped with a substantial sail, despite the original having oar power only. They took a year to make\n\nDuring the Viking Age (900-1200 AD) Vikings were the dominant seafarers of the North Atlantic. One of the keys to their success was the able to navigate skillfully across the open waters. The Vikings were experts in judging speed and wind direction, and in knowing the current and when to expect high and low tides. Viking navigational techniques are not well understood, but historians postulate that the Vikings probably had some sort of primitive astrolabe and used the stars to plot their course.\n\nViking Sundial\n\nDuring an excavation of a Viking Age farm in southern Greenland part of a circular disk with carvings was recovered. The discovery of the so-called Viking Sundial suggested a hypothesis that it was used as a compass. Archaeologists found a piece of stone and a fragment of wooden disk both featuring straight and hyperbolic carvings. It turned out that the two items had been parts of sundials used by the Vikings as a compass during their sea-crossings along latitude 61 degrees North.\n\nArchaeologists have found two devices which they interpret as navigation instruments. Both appear to be sundials with gnomon curves etched on a flat surface. The devices are small enough to be held flat in the hand at diameter. A wooden version dated to about 1000 AD was found in Greenland. A stone version was also found at Vatnahverfi, Greenland. By looking at the place where the shadow from the rod falls on a carved curve, a navigator is able to sail along a line of latitude. Both gnomon curve devices show the curve for 61° north very prominently. This was the approximate latitude that the Vikings would have sailed along to get to Greenland from Scandinavia. The wooden device also has north marked and had 32 arrow heads around the edge that may be the points of a compass. Other lines are interpreted as the solstice and equinox curves. The device was tested successfully, as a sun compass, during a 1984 reenactment when a longship sailed across the North Atlantic. It was accurate to within ± 5°.\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou suggested in 1967 that the \"sun-stones\" referred to in some sagas might have been natural crystals capable of polarizing skylight. The mineral cordierite occurring in Norway has the local name \"Viking's Compass.\" Its changes in colour would allow determining the sun's position (azimuth) even through an overcast or foggy horizon. The sunstones are doubly refracting, meaning that objects viewed through them can be seen as double because of positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged carbonate ions. When looking at the sun the stone, it will project two overlapping shadows on the crystal. The opacities of these shadows will vary depending on the sunstone's direction to the sun. When the two projected shapes have exactly the same opacity, it means the stone's long side is facing directly toward the sun. Since the stone uses light polarization, it works the best when the sun is at lower altitudes, or closer to the horizon. It makes sense that Norsemen were able to make use of sunstones, since much of the area they travelled and explored was near polar, where the sun is very close to the horizon for a good amount of the year. For example, in the Vinland sagas we see long voyages to North America, the majority sailed at over 61 degrees north.\n\nAn ingenious navigation method is detailed in \"Viking Navigation Using the Sunstone, Polarized Light and the Horizon Board\" by Leif K. Karlsen. To derive a course to steer relative to the sun direction, he uses a sun-stone (solarsteinn) made of Iceland spar (optical calcite or silfurberg), and a \"horizon-board.\" The author constructed the latter from an Icelandic saga source, and describes an experiment performed to determine its accuracy. Karlsen also discusses why on North Atlantic trips the Vikings might have preferred to navigate by the sun rather than by stars, as at high latitudes in summer the days are long and the nights short.\n\nA Viking named Stjerner Oddi compiled a chart showing the direction of sunrise and sunset, which enabled navigators to sail longships from place to place with ease. Almgren, an earlier Viking, told of another method: \"All the measurements of angles were made with what was called a 'half wheel' (a kind of half sun-diameter which corresponds to about sixteen minutes of arc). This was something that was known to every skipper at that time, or to the long-voyage pilot or \"kendtmand\" ('man who knows the way') who sometimes went along on voyages ... When the sun was in the sky, it was not, therefore, difficult to find the four points of the compass, and determining latitude did not cause any problems either.\" (Almgrem)\n\nBirds provided a helpful guide to finding land. A Viking legend states that Vikings used to take caged crows aboard ships and let them loose if they got lost. The crows would instinctively head for land, giving the sailors a course to steer.\n\nThe longships had two methods of propulsion: oars and sail. At sea, the sail enabled longships to travel faster than by oar and to cover long distances overseas with far less manual effort. Sails could be raised or lowered quickly. In a modern facsimile the mast can be lowered in 90 seconds. Oars were used when near the coast or in a river, to gain speed quickly, and when there was an adverse (or insufficient) wind. In combat, the variability of wind power made rowing the chief means of propulsion. The ship was steered by a vertical flat blade with a short round handle, at right angles, mounted over the starboard side of the aft gunwale.\n\nLongships were not fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on sea chests (chests containing their personal possessions) that would otherwise take up space. The chests were made the same size and were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.\n\nAn innovation that improved the sail's performance was the beitass, or stretching pole—a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward performance of the ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about long on the outside of the hull.\n\nThe Vikings were major contributors to the shipbuilding technology of their day. Their shipbuilding methods spread through extensive contact with other cultures, and ships from the 11th and 12th centuries are known to borrow many of the longships' design features, despite the passing of many centuries. The Lancha Poveira, a boat from Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal is one of the last remnants from the longship, keeping all the longboat features but without a long stern and bow, and with a lateen sail. It was used until the 1950s. Today there is just one boat: \"Fé em Deus\".\n\nMany historians, archaeologists and adventurers have reconstructed longships in an attempt to understand how they worked. These re-creators have been able to identify many of the advances that the Vikings implemented in order to make the longship a superior vessel.\n\nThe longship was a master of all trades. It was wide and stable, yet light, fast, and nimble. With all these qualities combined in one ship, the longship was unrivalled for centuries, until the arrival of the great cog.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the longship was the usual vessel for war even with the introduction of cogs in the 12th–13th centuries. Leidang fleet-levy laws remained in place for most of the Middle Ages, demanding that the freemen should build, man and furnish ships for war if demanded by the king—ships with at least 20 or 25 oar-pairs (40–50+ rowers). However, by the late 14th century, these low-boarded vessels were at a disadvantage against newer, taller vessels—when the Victual Brothers, in the employ of the Hansa, attacked Bergen in the autumn of 1393, the \"great ships\" of the pirates could not be boarded by the Norwegian levy ships called out by Margaret I of Denmark, and the raiders were able to sack the town with impunity. While earlier times had seen larger and taller longships in service, by this time the authorities had also gone over to other types of ships for warfare. The last Viking longship was defeated in 1429.\n\nSeveral of the original longships built in the Viking Age have been excavated by archaeologists. A selection of vessels that has been particularly important to our understanding of the longships design and construction, comprise the following:\n\nBULLET::::- The Nydam ship (c. 310–320 AD) is a burial ship from Denmark. This oaken vessel is long and was propelled by oars only. No mast is attached, as it was a later addition to the longship design. The Nydam ship shows a combination of building styles and is important to our understanding of the evolution of the early Viking ships.\nBULLET::::- \"\"Puck 2\"\" is the name given to a longship found in the Bay of Gdansk in Poland in 1977. It has been dated to the first half of the 10th century and was 19–20 metres long in its day. It is peculiar and important because it was constructed by Western Slavic craftsmen, not Scandinavian. The design only differs very slightly from the Scandinavian built longships.\nBULLET::::- \"\"Hedeby 1\"\" is the name given to a longship found in the harbour of Hedeby in 1953. At nearly 31 metres long, it is of the Skeid type, built around 985 AD. With a maximum width of just 2.7 metres it has a width-to-length ratio of more than 11, making it the slimmest longship ever discovered. It is made of oaken wood and its construction would have required a very high level of craftsmanship.\nBULLET::::- The Oseberg ship and the Gokstad ship – both from Vestfold in Norway. They both represent the longship design of the later Viking Age.\nBULLET::::- \"\"Skuldelev 2\"\" is the name given to the longest longship ever found at approximately 30 metres. It was discovered in 1996-97 at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. The ship was built near Dublin around 1042. Longships were constructed progressively longer near the end of the Viking Age.\n\nA selection of important longships known only from written sources includes:\n\nBULLET::::- The Ormen Lange (\"\"The Long Serpent\"\") was the most famous longship of Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason.\nBULLET::::- The Mora was the ship given to William the Conqueror by his wife, Matilda, and used as the flagship in the Norman conquest of England. It is said to be of the \"drakar\" type.\nBULLET::::- The Mariasuda, flagship of Norwegian king Sverre at the Battle of Fimreite, the largest recorded longship.\n\nThere are many replicas of Viking ships - including longships - in existence. Some are just inspired by the longship design in general, while others are intricate works of experimental archaeology, trying to replicate the originals as accurately as possible. Replicas important to our understanding of the original longships design and construction include:\nBULLET::::- \"Viking\", the very first Viking ship replica, was built by the Rødsverven shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway, modelled after the Gokstad ship. In 1893, it sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to Chicago in The United States for the World's Columbian Exposition.\nBULLET::::- The Skuldelev replicas. All the five Skuldelev ships have been replicated, some of them several times. They are each of a different design and only Skuldelev 1, 2 and 5 are longships.\nBULLET::::- The Sea Stallion is a replica of the Skuldelev 2 ship, constructed by authentic methods. At , it is the second longest Viking ship replica ever made. Skuldelev 2 was originally built near Dublin around 1042, and was rediscovered in Roskilde, Denmark in 1962. The Sea Stallion sailed from Roskilde to Dublin in summer 2007, to commemorate the voyage of the original. In the winter 2007-2008, The Sea Stallion was exhibited outside the National Museum in Dublin. In the summer of 2008, the Sea Stallion returned to Roskilde on a searoute south of England.\nBULLET::::- Dragon Harald Fairhair is the largest longship built in modern times at . The ship is not a replica of any specific original longship, but was built by authentic construction methods. It was constructed in Haugesund, Norway and launched in 2012.\nBULLET::::- The Íslendingur (Icelander) is a replica of the Gokstad ship that was built using traditional building techniques. In 2000, it was sailed from Iceland to L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, to participate in the 1000 year anniversary of Leif Erikson's discovery of America.\nBULLET::::- \"The Munin\" is a half-sized replica of the Gokstad ship. Berthed at the Vancouver Maritime Museum, she was built at the Scandinavian Community Centre, Burnaby, British Columbia and launched in 2001.\nBULLET::::- The Myklebust Ship is a 30 m replica of the original ship of the same name found in Nordfjordeid, Norway. The replica is situated in the Sagastad knowledge center, and is the largest longship ever discovered in Norway. The replica is the largest replica based on an original find. The replica was christened in 2019, as part of the opening of Sagastad.\n\nBULLET::::- Viking ships\nBULLET::::- Medieval ships\nBULLET::::- Birlinn\nBULLET::::- Nordland\nBULLET::::- Knarr\nBULLET::::- Leidang\nBULLET::::- Hugin\n\nBULLET::::- Bill, Jan (1997). \"Ships and seamanship\", in Sawyer, P.

{"id": "18026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18026", "title": "Luigi Alamanni", "text": "Luigi Alamanni\n\nLuigi Alamanni (sometimes spelt Alemanni) (6 March 149518 April 1556) was an Italian poet and statesman. He was regarded as a prolific and versatile poet. He was credited with introducing the epigram into Italian poetry.\n\nAlamanni was born in Florence. His father was a devoted adherent of the Medici party, but Luigi, smarting under a supposed injustice, joined with others in an unsuccessful conspiracy against Giulio de' Medici, afterwards Pope Clement VII. He was obliged in consequence to take refuge in Venice, and, on the accession of Clement, to flee to France. When Florence shook off the papal yoke in 1527, Alamanni returned, and took a prominent part in the management of the affairs of the republic. \n\nOn the restoration of the Medici in 1530, he had again to take refuge in France, where he composed the greater part of his works. He was a favourite with Francis I, who sent him as ambassador to Charles V after the Peace of Crepy in 1544.\n\nAs an instance of his tact in this capacity, it is related that when Charles interrupted a complimentary address by quoting from a satirical poem of Alamanni's the words:\"\"l'aquila grifagna, Che per piu devorar, duoi rostri porta\"\" (\"\"Two crooked bills the ravenous eagle bears, The better to devour\"\"), the latter at once replied that he spoke them as a poet, who was permitted to use fictions, but that he spoke now as an ambassador, who was obliged to tell the truth. The ready reply pleased Charles, who added some complimentary words.\n\nAfter the death of Francis, Alamanni enjoyed the confidence of his successor Henry II, and in 1551 was sent by him as his ambassador to Genoa. He died at Amboise on 18 April 1556.\n\nHe wrote a large number of poems, distinguished by the purity and excellence of their style. The best is a didactic poem, \"La Coltivazione\" (Paris, 1546; see 1546 in poetry), written in imitation of Virgil's Georgics. His \"Opere Toscane\" (Lyon, 1532) consists of satirical pieces written in blank verse. His use of Horatian epistolary satire is important and his tenth satire was used as a model by Sir Thomas Wyatt in his poem 'Mine own John Poyntz' which introduced the form into English literature. An unfinished poem, \"Avarchide\", in imitation of the Iliad, was the work of his old age and has little merit.\n\nIt has been said by some that Alamanni was the first to use blank verse in Italian poetry, but that distinction belongs rather to his contemporary Giangiorgio Trissino.\n\nIsabella di Morra dedicated a sonnet to Alamanni called \"Non sol il ciel vi fu largo e cortese\" (\"\"Not only was heaven generous and courteous to you\"\").\n\nAlamanni is a minor speaker in Machiavelli's \"The Art of War\", a book structured as a dialogue between real people known to Machiavelli, and set in the gardens of Cosimo Ruccelai. In this book, Alamanni is present as a loyal friend of the host, and is mentioned to be the youngest of Ruccelai's friends present.\n\nBULLET::::- A poetical romance, \"Girone il Cortese\" (Paris, 1548; see 1548 in poetry)\nBULLET::::- A tragedy, \"Antigone\"\nBULLET::::- A comedy, \"Flora\"\n\n"}

He served as the Archbishop of Arles from 1423 until his resignation in 1440 when he had resigned from the cardinalate. But he was later reinstated as a cardinal on 19 December 1449 at which point he served as the Protopriest and also reclaimed his titular church.\n\nAleman served as the Bishop of Maguelonne from 1418 until his archepiscopal elevation at which point he was later named a cardinal. Aleman once led opposition to Pope Eugene IV while pledging allegiance to an antipope which led to Eugene IV stripping Aleman of all ecclesiastical dignities that he had been entitled to. But he later convinced the antipope to abdicate as a means of ending the Western Schism at which stage Aleman was restored to the cardinalate and returned to full communion with the Roman see under Pope Nicholas V. He has often been dubbed as the \"Cardinal of Arles\".\n\nHis beatification received approval on 9 April 1527 from Pope Clement VII.\n\nLouis Aleman was born to nobles circa 1390 at the castle in Arbent to Jean Aleman and Marie de Châtillon de Michaille. His archbishop grand-uncle was François de Conzie (c.1356-31.12.1431/2).\n\nHe was present at the Council of Pisa in 1409. He studied canon law and graduated in that area with a doctorate in 1414 at the college in Avignon. In 1417 he was made the abbot commendatario of Saint-Pierre de la Tour.\n\nAleman served as the Governor of the Romagna since 1424 and had to face the ongoing struggles between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines in Bologna. One of the Guelph families - the Canetols - even imprisoned Aleman for several weeks but Aleman was later released and moved to Rome to serve in the court of Pope Martin V. Aleman served as a noted advisor to the pope and also served as a courtier while in the papal court. He had served in the papal court for Martin V since July 1417.\n\nOn 22 June 1418 he was appointed as the Bishop of Maguelonne and he was installed into his new see on 17 May 1419. The pope himself granted episcopal consecration to Aleman in Mantua. He later became a diplomat to Siena in 1422. Aleman was later promoted as the newest Archbishop of Arles on 3 December 1423 and was installed in that see on 16 May 1424. Martin V named him a cardinal on 24 May 1426 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia - he received that title on 27 May. From 1427 until 1431 he served as the Camerlengo for the College of Cardinals. He served as a legate to Bologna from 1426 to 1428 and did not participate in the conclave of 1431.\n\nHe was a prominent member of the Council of Basel since 1432 and together with Cardinal Julian Cesarini led the forces that maintained the power of the general councils over the pope's own control of the Church. It was while the council was proceeding that he tended to victims of the plague. He later led opposition to the pope but Cesarini was reconciled with Pope Eugene IV and had a prominent part in the pope's convoked Council of Florence. In 1439 he led the effort to depose Eugene IV and the election of a successor. In 1440 he placed the tiara upon Antipope Felix V and consecrated him as a bishop. This was a misguided attempt at reforming the Church which Aleman believed was vital. Eugene IV was responded to this and excommunicated the antipope while also depriving Aleman of all his ecclesiastical dignities. This also meant that Aleman could no longer be considered a cardinal and he was deprived of the dignities that came with the cardinalate. This occurred on 11 April 1440: he was stripped of Arles as his archdiocese and was stripped of his titular church.\n\nAntipope Felix V made him the legate to the Diet of Frankfurt to the court of Emperor Friedrich IV. He was further involved in the unsuccessful efforts to win over Europe's princes to Basel's antipope. In order to make an end of the schism the former cardinal advised Felix V to abdicate at which stage Pope Nicholas V restored the cardinal to all his honors and appointed him as a papal legate to the German kingdom] in 1449; his full restoration was on 19 December 1449. He was granted back his titular church as well and from that moment until his death served as the Protopriest of the College of Cardinals. It was due to his estrangement to the Roman see that he was not permitted to participate in the conclave of 1447. He returned to his former archdiocese where he dedicated himself with great zeal to the catechetical formation of the people.\n\nHe died on 16 September 1450 at the Franciscan convent in Salon at Arles. Aleman's remains are housed in Saint-Trophine d'Arles.\n\nHis beatification was approved and celebrated on 9 April 1527 after Pope Clement VII confirmed that there had been a longstanding and popular cultus (otherwise known as an enduring public veneration) aimed at the late cardinal.\n\nAttribution:\n\nBULLET::::- See U.

{"id": "18030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18030", "title": "LR parser", "text": "LR parser\n\nIn computer science, LR parsers are a type of bottom-up parser that analyses deterministic context-free languages in linear time. There are several variants of LR parsers: SLR parsers, LALR parsers, Canonical LR(1) parsers, Minimal LR(1) parsers, GLR parsers. LR parsers can be generated by a parser generator from a formal grammar defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of computer languages.\n\nAn LR parser (Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation in reverse) reads input text from left to right without backing up (this is true for most parsers), and produces a rightmost derivation in reverse: it does a bottom-up parse - not a top-down LL parse or ad-hoc parse. The name LR is often followed by a numeric qualifier, as in LR(1) or sometimes LR(\"k\"). To avoid backtracking or guessing, the LR parser is allowed to peek ahead at \"k\" lookahead input symbols before deciding how to parse earlier symbols. Typically \"k\" is 1 and is not mentioned. The name LR is often preceded by other qualifiers, as in SLR and LALR. The LR(\"k\") condition for a grammar was suggested by Knuth to stand for \"translatable from left to right with bound \"k\".\"\n\nLR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time. This is ideal for computer languages, but LR parsers are not suited for human languages which need more flexible but inevitably slower methods. Some methods which can parse arbitrary context-free languages (e.g., Cocke–Younger–Kasami, Earley, GLR) have worst-case performance of O(\"n\") time. Other methods which backtrack or yield multiple parses may even take exponential time when they guess badly.\n\nThe above properties of L, R, and k are actually shared by all shift-reduce parsers, including precedence parsers. But by convention, the LR name stands for the form of parsing invented by Donald Knuth, and excludes the earlier, less powerful precedence methods (for example Operator-precedence parser).\nLR parsers can handle a larger range of languages and grammars than precedence parsers or top-down LL parsing. This is because the LR parser waits until it has seen an entire instance of some grammar pattern before committing to what it has found. An LL parser has to decide or guess what it is seeing much sooner, when it has only seen the leftmost input symbol of that pattern.\n\nAn LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text. The parser builds up the parse tree incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking. At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed. Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.\n\nAt step 6 in an example parse, only \"A*2\" has been parsed, incompletely. Only the shaded lower-left corner of the parse tree exists. None of the parse tree nodes numbered 7 and above exist yet. Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the roots of isolated subtrees for variable A, operator *, and number 2, respectively. These three root nodes are temporarily held in a parse stack. The remaining unparsed portion of the input stream is \"+ 1\".\n\nAs with other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser works by doing some combination of Shift steps and Reduce steps. \nBULLET::::- A Shift step advances in the input stream by one symbol. That shifted symbol becomes a new single-node parse tree.\nBULLET::::- A Reduce step applies a completed grammar rule to some of the recent parse trees, joining them together as one tree with a new root symbol.\nIf the input has no syntax errors, the parser continues with these steps until all of the input has been consumed and all of the parse trees have been reduced to a single tree representing an entire legal input.\n\nLR parsers differ from other shift-reduce parsers in how they decide when to reduce, and how to pick between rules with similar endings. But the final decisions and the sequence of shift or reduce steps are the same.\n\nMuch of the LR parser's efficiency is from being deterministic. To avoid guessing, the LR parser often looks ahead (rightwards) at the next scanned symbol, before deciding what to do with previously scanned symbols. The lexical scanner works one or more symbols ahead of the parser. The lookahead symbols are the 'right-hand context' for the parsing decision.\n\nLike other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser lazily waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is. The parser then acts immediately on the combination instead of waiting any further. In the parse tree example, the phrase A gets reduced to Value and then to Products in steps 1-3 as soon as lookahead * is seen, rather than waiting any later to organize those parts of the parse tree. The decisions for how to handle A are based only on what the parser and scanner have already seen, without considering things that appear much later to the right.\n\nReductions reorganize the most recently parsed things, immediately to the left of the lookahead symbol. So the list of already-parsed things acts like a stack. This parse stack grows rightwards. The base or bottom of the stack is on the left and holds the leftmost, oldest parse fragment. Every reduction step acts only on the rightmost, newest parse fragments. (This accumulative parse stack is very unlike the predictive, leftward-growing parse stack used by top-down parsers.)\n\n! !! !! !! \n\nStep 6 applies a grammar rule with multiple parts:\nThis matches the stack top holding the parsed phrases \"... Products * Value\". The reduce step replaces this instance of the rule's right hand side, \"Products * Value\" by the rule's left hand side symbol, here a larger Products. If the parser builds complete parse trees, the three trees for inner Products, *, and Value are combined by a new tree root for Products. Otherwise, semantic details from the inner Products and Value are output to some later compiler pass, or are combined and saved in the new Products symbol.\n\nIn LR parsers, the shift and reduce decisions are potentially based on the entire stack of everything that has been previously parsed, not just on a single, topmost stack symbol. If done in an unclever way, that could lead to very slow parsers that get slower and slower for longer inputs. LR parsers do this with constant speed, by summarizing all the relevant left context information into a single number called the LR(0) parser state. For each grammar and LR analysis method, there is a fixed (finite) number of such states. Besides holding the already-parsed symbols, the parse stack also remembers the state numbers reached by everything up to those points.\n\nAt every parse step, the entire input text is divided into a stack of previously parsed phrases, and a current lookahead symbol, and the remaining unscanned text. The parser's next action is determined by its current LR(0) (rightmost on the stack) and the lookahead symbol. In the steps below, all the black details are exactly the same as in other non-LR shift-reduce parsers. LR parser stacks add the state information in purple, summarizing the black phrases to their left on the stack and what syntax possibilities to expect next. Users of an LR parser can usually ignore state information. These states are explained in a later section.\n\n! !! !! !! !! !!  \n\n\"id\" \nValue\nProducts\nProducts * \nProducts *\n\"int\" \nProducts *\nValue\nProducts \nSums \nSums \nSums \n\"int\"\nSums \nValue \nSums \nProducts\nSums \n\nAt initial step 0, the input stream \"A*2 + 1\" is divided into\nBULLET::::- an empty section on the parse stack,\nBULLET::::- lookahead text \"A\" scanned as an \"id\" symbol, and\nBULLET::::- the remaining unscanned text \"*2 + 1\".\nThe parse stack begins by holding only initial state 0. When state 0 sees the lookahead \"id\", it knows to shift that \"id\" onto the stack, and scan the next input symbol *, and advance to state 9.\n\nAt step 4, the total input stream \"A*2 + 1\" is currently divided into \nBULLET::::- the parsed section \"A *\" with 2 stacked phrases Products and *,\nBULLET::::- lookahead text \"2\" scanned as an \"int\" symbol, and\nBULLET::::- the remaining unscanned text \" + 1\".\nThe states corresponding to the stacked phrases are 0, 4, and 5. The current, rightmost state on the stack is state 5. When state 5 sees the lookahead \"int\", it knows to shift that \"int\" onto the stack as its own phrase, and scan the next input symbol +, and advance to state 8.\n\nAt step 12, all of the input stream has been consumed but only partially organized. The current state is 3. When state 3 sees the lookahead \"eof\", it knows to apply the completed grammar rule\nby combining the stack's rightmost three phrases for Sums, +, and Products into one thing. State 3 itself doesn't know what the next state should be. This is found by going back to state 0, just to the left of the phrase being reduced. When state 0 sees this new completed instance of a Sums, it advances to state 1 (again). This consulting of older states is why they are kept on the stack, instead of keeping only the current state.\n\nLR parsers are constructed from a grammar that formally defines the syntax of the input language as a set of patterns. The grammar doesn't cover all language rules, such as the size of numbers, or the consistent use of names and their definitions in the context of the whole program. LR parsers use a context-free grammar that deals just with local patterns of symbols.\n\nThe example grammar used here is a tiny subset of the Java or C language:\n\nThe grammar's terminal symbols are the multi-character symbols or 'tokens' found in the input stream by a lexical scanner. Here these include + * and \"int\" for any integer constant, and \"id\" for any identifier name, and \"eof\" for end of input file. The grammar doesn't care what the \"int\" values or \"id\" spellings are, nor does it care about blanks or line breaks. The grammar uses these terminal symbols but does not define them. They are always leaf nodes (at the bottom bushy end) of the parse tree.\n\nThe capitalized terms like Sums are nonterminal symbols. These are names for concepts or patterns in the language. They are defined in the grammar and never occur themselves in the input stream. They are always internal nodes (above the bottom) of the parse tree. They only happen as a result of the parser applying some grammar rule. Some nonterminals are defined with two or more rules; these are alternative patterns. Rules can refer back to themselves, which are called \"recursive\". This grammar uses recursive rules to handle repeated math operators. Grammars for complete languages use recursive rules to handle lists, parenthesized expressions, and nested statements.\n\nAny given computer language can be described by several different grammars. An LR(1) parser can handle many but not all common grammars. It is usually possible to manually modify a grammar so that it fits the limitations of LR(1) parsing and the generator tool.\n\nThe grammar for an LR parser must be unambiguous itself, or must be augmented by tie-breaking precedence rules. This means there is only one correct way to apply the grammar to a given legal example of the language, resulting in a unique parse tree with just one meaning, and a unique sequence of shift/reduce actions for that example. LR parsing is not a useful technique for human languages with ambiguous grammars that depend on the interplay of words. Human languages are better handled by parsers like Generalized LR parser, the Earley parser, or the CYK algorithm that can simultaneously compute all possible parse trees in one pass.\n\nMost LR parsers are table driven. The parser's program code is a simple generic loop that is the same for all grammars and languages. The knowledge of the grammar and its syntactic implications are encoded into unchanging data tables called parse tables (or parsing tables). Entries in a table show whether to shift or reduce (and by which grammar rule), for every legal combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. The parse tables also tell how to compute the next state, given just a current state and a next symbol.\n\nThe parse tables are much larger than the grammar. LR tables are hard to accurately compute by hand for big grammars. So they are mechanically derived from the grammar by some parser generator tool like Bison.\n\nDepending on how the states and parsing table are generated, the resulting parser is called either a SLR (simple LR) parser, LALR (look-ahead LR) parser, or canonical LR parser. LALR parsers handle more grammars than SLR parsers. Canonical LR parsers handle even more grammars, but use many more states and much larger tables. The example grammar is SLR.\n\nLR parse tables are two-dimensional. Each current LR(0) parser state has its own row. Each possible next symbol has its own column. Some combinations of state and next symbol are not possible for valid input streams. These blank cells trigger syntax error messages.\n\nThe Action left half of the table has columns for lookahead terminal symbols. These cells determine whether the next parser action is shift (to state \"n\"), or reduce (by grammar rule r).\n\nThe Goto right half of the table has columns for nonterminal symbols. These cells show which state to advance to, after some reduction's Left Hand Side has created an expected new instance of that symbol. This is like a shift action but for nonterminals; the lookahead terminal symbol is unchanged.\n\nThe table column \"Current Rules\" documents the meaning and syntax possibilities for each state, as worked out by the parser generator. It is not included in the actual tables used at parsing time. The (pink dot) marker shows where the parser is now, within some partially recognized grammar rules. The things to the left of have been parsed, and the things to the right are expected soon. A state has several such current rules if the parser has not yet narrowed possibilities down to a single rule.\n\n! Curr !! !! colspan=\"5\"  Lookahead !! !! colspan=\"3\"  LHS Goto\n! State !! Current Rules !! \"int\" !! \"id\" !! *   !! +   !! \"eof\" !! !! Sums !! Products !! Value\n\nIn state 2 above, the parser has just found and shifted-in the + of grammar rule\nThe next expected phrase is Products. Products begins with terminal symbols \"int\" or \"id\". If the lookahead is either of those, the parser shifts them in and advances to state 8 or 9, respectively. When a Products has been found, the parser advances to state 3 to accumulate the complete list of summands and find the end of rule r0. A Products can also begin with nonterminal Value. For any other lookahead or nonterminal, the parser announces a syntax error.\n\nIn state 3, the parser has just found a Products phrase, that could be from two possible grammar rules:\nThe choice between r1 and r3 can't be decided just from looking backwards at prior phrases. The parser has to check the lookahead symbol to tell what to do. If the lookahead is *, it is in rule 3, so the parser shifts in the * and advances to state 5. If the lookahead is \"eof\", it is at the end of rule 1 and rule 0, so the parser is done.\n\nIn state 9 above, all the non-blank, non-error cells are for the same reduction r6. Some parsers save time and table space by not checking the lookahead symbol in these simple cases. Syntax errors are then detected somewhat later, after some harmless reductions, but still before the next shift action or parser decision.\n\nIndividual table cells must not hold multiple, alternative actions, otherwise the parser would be nondeterministic with guesswork and backtracking. If the grammar is not LR(1), some cells will have shift/reduce conflicts between a possible shift action and reduce action, or reduce/reduce conflicts between multiple grammar rules. LR(k) parsers resolve these conflicts (where possible) by checking additional lookahead symbols beyond the first.\n\nThe LR parser begins with a nearly empty parse stack containing just the start state 0, and with the lookahead holding the input stream's first scanned symbol. The parser then repeats the following loop step until done, or stuck on a syntax error:\n\nThe topmost state on the parse stack is some state \"s\", and the current lookahead is some terminal symbol \"t\". Look up the next parser action from row \"s\" and column \"t\" of the Lookahead Action table. That action is either Shift, Reduce, Done, or Error:\nBULLET::::- Shift \"n\":\nBULLET::::- Reduce r: Apply grammar rule r: Lhs → S S ... S\nBULLET::::- Done: Lookahead \"t\" is the \"eof\" marker. End of parsing. If the state stack contains just the start state report success. Otherwise, report a syntax error.\nBULLET::::- Error: Report a syntax error. The parser ends, or attempts some recovery.\n\nLR parser stack usually stores just the LR(0) automaton states, as the grammar symbols may be derived from them (in the automaton, all input transitions to some state are marked with the same symbol, which is the symbol associated with this state). Moreover, these symbols are almost never needed as the state is all that matters when making the parsing decision.\n\nThis section of the article can be skipped by most users of LR parser generators.\n\nState 2 in the example parse table is for the partially parsed rule \nThis shows how the parser got here, by seeing Sums then + while looking for a larger Sums. The marker has advanced beyond the beginning of the rule. It also shows how the parser expects to eventually complete the rule, by next finding a complete Products. But more details are needed on how to parse all the parts of that Products.\n\nThe partially parsed rules for a state are called its \"core LR(0) items\". The parser generator adds additional rules or items for all the possible next steps in building up the expected Products:\nThe marker is at the beginning of each of these added rules; the parser has not yet confirmed and parsed any part of them. These additional items are called the \"closure\" of the core items. For each nonterminal symbol immediately following a , the generator adds the rules defining that symbol. This adds more markers, and possibly different follower symbols. This closure process continues until all follower symbols have been expanded. The follower nonterminals for state 2 begins with Products. Value is then added by closure. The follower terminals are \"int\" and \"id\".\n\nThe kernel and closure items together show all possible legal ways to proceed from the current state to future states and complete phrases. If a follower symbol appears in only one item, it leads to a next state containing only one core item with the marker advanced. So \"int\" leads to next state 8 with core\n\nIf the same follower symbol appears in several items, the parser cannot yet tell which rule applies here. So that symbol leads to a next state that shows all remaining possibilities, again with the marker advanced. Products appears in both r1 and r3. So Products leads to next state 4 with core\nIn words, that means if the parser has seen a single Products, it might be done, or it might still have even more things to multiply together. All the core items have the same symbol preceding the marker; all transitions into this state are always with that same symbol.\n\nSome transitions will be to cores and states that have been enumerated already. Other transitions lead to new states. The generator starts with the grammar's goal rule. From there it keeps exploring known states and transitions until all needed states have been found.\n\nThese states are called \"LR(0)\" states because they use a lookahead of \"k\"=0, i.e. no lookahead. The only checking of input symbols occurs when the symbol is shifted in. Checking of lookaheads for reductions is done separately by the parse table, not by the enumerated states themselves.\n\nThe parse table describes all possible LR(0) states and their transitions. They form a finite state machine (FSM). An FSM is a simple engine for parsing simple unnested languages, without using a stack. In this LR application, the FSM's modified \"input language\" has both terminal and nonterminal symbols, and covers any partially parsed stack snapshot of the full LR parse.\n\nRecall step 5 of the Parse Steps Example:\n\n! !! !! !! \nProducts *\n\"int\" \n\nThe parse stack shows a series of state transitions, from the start state 0, to state 4 and then on to 5 and current state 8. The symbols on the parse stack are the shift or goto symbols for those transitions. Another way to view this, is that the finite state machine can scan the stream \"Products * \"int\" + 1\" (without using yet another stack) and find the leftmost complete phrase that should be reduced next. And that is indeed its job!\n\nHow can a mere FSM do this when the original unparsed language has nesting and recursion and definitely requires an analyzer with a stack? The trick is that everything to the left of the stack top has already been fully reduced. This eliminates all the loops and nesting from those phrases. The FSM can ignore all the older beginnings of phrases, and track just the newest phrases that might be completed next. The obscure name for this in LR theory is \"viable prefix.\"\n\nThe states and transitions give all the needed information for the parse table's shift actions and goto actions. The generator also needs to calculate the expected lookahead sets for each reduce action.\n\nIn SLR parsers, these lookahead sets are determined directly from the grammar, without considering the individual states and transitions. For each nonterminal S, the SLR generator works out Follows(S), the set of all the terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of S. In the parse table, each reduction to S uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set. Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers. A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using Follow sets is called an SLR grammar.\n\nLALR parsers have the same states as SLR parsers, but use a more complicated, more precise way of working out the minimum necessary reduction lookaheads for each individual state. Depending on the details of the grammar, this may turn out to be the same as the Follow set computed by SLR parser generators, or it may turn out to be a subset of the SLR lookaheads. Some grammars are okay for LALR parser generators but not for SLR parser generators. This happens when the grammar has spurious shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts using Follow sets, but no conflicts when using the exact sets computed by the LALR generator. The grammar is then called LALR(1) but not SLR.\n\nAn SLR or LALR parser avoids having duplicate states. But this minimization is not necessary, and can sometimes create unnecessary lookahead conflicts. Canonical LR parsers use duplicated (or \"split\") states to better remember the left and right context of a nonterminal's use. Each occurrence of a symbol S in the grammar can be treated independently with its own lookahead set, to help resolve reduction conflicts. This handles a few more grammars. Unfortunately, this greatly magnifies the size of the parse tables if done for all parts of the grammar. This splitting of states can also be done manually and selectively with any SLR or LALR parser, by making two or more named copies of some nonterminals. A grammar that is conflict-free for a canonical LR generator but has conflicts in an LALR generator is called LR(1) but not LALR(1), and not SLR.\n\nSLR, LALR, and canonical LR parsers make exactly the same shift and reduce decisions when the input stream is correct language. When the input has a syntax error, the LALR parser may do some additional (harmless) reductions before detecting the error than would the canonical LR parser. And the SLR parser may do even more. This happens because the SLR and LALR parsers are using a generous superset approximation to the true, minimal lookahead symbols for that particular state.\n\nLR parsers can generate somewhat helpful error messages for the first syntax error in a program, by simply enumerating all the terminal symbols that could have appeared next instead of the unexpected bad lookahead symbol. But this does not help the parser work out how to parse the remainder of the input program to look for further, independent errors. If the parser recovers badly from the first error, it is very likely to mis-parse everything else and produce a cascade of unhelpful spurious error messages.\n\nIn the yacc and bison parser generators, the parser has an ad hoc mechanism to abandon the current statement, discard some parsed phrases and lookahead tokens surrounding the error, and resynchronize the parse at some reliable statement-level delimiter like semicolons or braces. This often works well for allowing the parser and compiler to look over the rest of the program.\n\nMany syntactic coding errors are simple typos or omissions of a trivial symbol. Some LR parsers attempt to detect and automatically repair these common cases. The parser enumerates every possible single-symbol insertion, deletion, or substitution at the error point. The compiler does a trial parse with each change to see if it worked okay. (This requires backtracking to snapshots of the parse stack and input stream, normally unneeded by the parser.) Some best repair is picked. This gives a very helpful error message and resynchronizes the parse well. However, the repair is not trustworthy enough to permanently modify the input file. Repair of syntax errors is easiest to do consistently in parsers (like LR) that have parse tables and an explicit data stack.\n\nThe LR parser generator decides what should happen for each combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. These decisions are usually turned into read-only data tables that drive a generic parser loop that is grammar- and state-independent. But there are also other ways to turn those decisions into an active parser.\n\nSome LR parser generators create separate tailored program code for each state, rather than a parse table. These parsers can run several times faster than the generic parser loop in table-driven parsers. The fastest parsers use generated assembler code.\n\nIn the recursive ascent parser variation, the explicit parse stack structure is also replaced by the implicit stack used by subroutine calls. Reductions terminate several levels of subroutine calls, which is clumsy in most languages. So recursive ascent parsers are generally slower, less obvious, and harder to hand-modify than recursive descent parsers.\n\nAnother variation replaces the parse table by pattern-matching rules in non-procedural languages such as Prolog.\n\nGLR Generalized LR parsers use LR bottom-up techniques to find all possible parses of input text, not just one correct parse. This is essential for ambiguous grammars such as used for human languages. The multiple valid parse trees are computed simultaneously, without backtracking. GLR is sometimes helpful for computer languages that are not easily described by a conflict-free LALR(1) grammar.\n\nLC Left corner parsers use LR bottom-up techniques for recognizing the left end of alternative grammar rules. When the alternatives have been narrowed down to a single possible rule, the parser then switches to top-down LL(1) techniques for parsing the rest of that rule. LC parsers have smaller parse tables than LALR parsers and better error diagnostics. There are no widely used generators for deterministic LC parsers. Multiple-parse LC parsers are helpful with human languages with very large grammars.\n\nLR parsers were invented by Donald Knuth in 1965 as an efficient generalization of precedence parsers. Knuth proved that LR parsers were the most general-purpose parsers possible that would still be efficient in the worst cases. \n\nIn other words, if a language was reasonable enough to allow an efficient one-pass parser, it could be described by an LR(\"k\") grammar. And that grammar could always be mechanically transformed into an equivalent (but larger) LR(1) grammar. So an LR(1) parsing method was, in theory, powerful enough to handle any reasonable language. In practice, the natural grammars for many programming languages are close to being LR(1).\n\nThe canonical LR parsers described by Knuth had too many states and very big parse tables that were impractically large for the limited memory of computers of that era. LR parsing became practical when Frank DeRemer invented SLR and LALR parsers with much fewer states.\n\nFor full details on LR theory and how LR parsers are derived from grammars, see \"The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling, Volume 1\" (Aho and Ullman).\n\nEarley parsers apply the techniques and notation of LR parsers to the task of generating all possible parses for ambiguous grammars such as for human languages.\n\nWhile LR(\"k\") grammars have equal generative power for all \"k\"≥1, the case of LR(0) grammars is slightly different.\nA language \"L\" is said to have the \"prefix property\" if no word in \"L\" is a proper prefix of another word in \"L\".\nA language \"L\" has an LR(0) grammar if and only if \"L\" is a deterministic context-free language with the prefix property.\nAs a consequence, a language \"L\" is deterministic context-free if and only if \"L\"$ has an LR(0) grammar, where \"$\" is not a symbol of \"L\"’s alphabet.\n\nThis example of LR parsing uses the following small grammar with goal symbol E:\n\nto parse the following input:\n\nThe two LR(0) parsing tables for this grammar look as follows:\n\nThe action table is indexed by a state of the parser and a terminal (including a special terminal $ that indicates the end of the input stream) and contains three types of actions:\nBULLET::::- \"shift\", which is written as 's\"n\"' and indicates that the next state is \"n\"\nBULLET::::- \"reduce\", which is written as 'r\"m\"' and indicates that a reduction with grammar rule \"m\" should be performed\nBULLET::::- \"accept\", which is written as 'acc' and indicates that the parser accepts the string in the input stream.\n\nThe goto table is indexed by a state of the parser and a nonterminal and simply indicates what the next state of the parser will be if it has recognized a certain nonterminal. This table is important to find out the next state after every reduction. After a reduction, the next state is found by looking up the goto table entry for top of the stack (i.e. current state) and the reduced rule's LHS (i.e. non-terminal).\n\nThe table below illustrates each step in the process. Here the state refers to the element at the top of the stack (the right-most element), and the next action is determined by referring to the action table above. A $ is appended to the input string to denote the end of the stream.\n\n! State\n! Input stream\n! Output stream\n! Stack\n! Next action\n\nThe parser starts out with the stack containing just the initial state ('0'):\n\nThe first symbol from the input string that the parser sees is '1'. To find the next action (shift, reduce, accept or error), the action table is indexed with the current state (the \"current state\" is just whatever is on the top of the stack), which in this case is 0, and the current input symbol, which is '1'. The action table specifies a shift to state 2, and so state 2 is pushed onto the stack (again, all the state information is in the stack, so \"shifting to state 2\" is the same as pushing 2 onto the stack). The resulting stack is\n\nwhere the top of the stack is 2. For the sake of explanation the symbol (e.g., '1', B) is shown that caused the transition to the next state, although strictly speaking it is not part of the stack.\n\nIn state 2, the action table says to reduce with grammar rule 5 (regardless of what terminal the parser sees on the input stream), which means that the parser has just recognized the right-hand side of rule 5. In this case, the parser writes 5 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has one symbol), and pushes on the stack the state from the cell in the goto table for state 0 and B, i.e., state 4. The resulting stack is:\n\nHowever, in state 4, the action table says the parser should now reduce with rule 3. So it writes 3 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack, and finds the new state in the goto table for state 0 and E, which is state 3. The resulting stack:\n\nThe next terminal that the parser sees is a '+' and according to the action table it should then go to state 6:\n\nThe resulting stack can be interpreted as the history of a finite state automaton that has just read a nonterminal E followed by a terminal '+'. The transition table of this automaton is defined by the shift actions in the action table and the goto actions in the goto table.\n\nThe next terminal is now '1' and this means that the parser performs a shift and go to state 2:\n\nJust as the previous '1' this one is reduced to B giving the following stack:\n\nThe stack corresponds with a list of states of a finite automaton that has read a nonterminal E, followed by a '+' and then a nonterminal B. In state 8 the parser always performs a reduce with rule 2. The top 3 states on the stack correspond with the 3 symbols in the right-hand side of rule 2. This time we pop 3 elements off of the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has 3 symbols) and look up the goto state for E and 0, thus pushing state 3 back onto the stack\n\nFinally, the parser reads a '$' (end of input symbol) from the input stream, which means that according to the action table (the current state is 3) the parser accepts the input string. The rule numbers that will then have been written to the output stream will be [5, 3, 5, 2] which is indeed a rightmost derivation of the string \"1 + 1\" in reverse.\n\nThe construction of these parsing tables is based on the notion of \"LR(0) items\" (simply called \"items\" here) which are grammar rules with a special dot added somewhere in the right-hand side. For example, the rule E → E + B has the following four corresponding items:\nRules of the form \"A\" → ε have only a single item \"A\" → . The item E → E + B, for example, indicates that the parser has recognized a string corresponding with E on the input stream and now expects to read a '+' followed by another string corresponding with B.\n\nIt is usually not possible to characterize the state of the parser with a single item because it may not know in advance which rule it is going to use for reduction. For example, if there is also a rule E → E * B then the items E → E + B and E → E * B will both apply after a string corresponding with E has been read. Therefore, it is convenient to characterize the state of the parser by a set of items, in this case the set { E → E + B, E → E * B }.\n\nAn item with a dot before a nonterminal, such as E → E + B, indicates that the parser expects to parse the nonterminal B next. To ensure the item set contains all possible rules the parser may be in the midst of parsing, it must include all items describing how B itself will be parsed. This means that if there are rules such as B → 1 and B → 0 then the item set must also include the items B → 1 and B → 0. In general this can be formulated as follows:\n\nThus, any set of items can be extended by recursively adding all the appropriate items until all nonterminals preceded by dots are accounted for. The minimal extension is called the \"closure\" of an item set and written as clos(\"I\") where \"I\" is an item set. It is these closed item sets that are taken as the states of the parser, although only the ones that are actually reachable from the begin state will be included in the tables.\n\nBefore the transitions between the different states are determined, the grammar is augmented with an extra rule\n\nwhere S is a new start symbol and E the old start symbol. The parser will use this rule for reduction exactly when it has accepted the whole input string.\n\nFor this example, the same grammar as above is augmented thus:\n\nIt is for this augmented grammar that the item sets and the transitions between them will be determined.\n\nThe first step of constructing the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined as if we are considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals. The begin state of this automaton is always the closure of the first item of the added rule: S → E:\n\nThe boldfaced \"+\" in front of an item indicates the items that were added for the closure (not to be confused with the mathematical '+' operator which is a terminal). The original items without a \"+\" are called the \"kernel\" of the item set.\n\nStarting at the begin state (S0), all of the states that can be reached from this state are now determined. The possible transitions for an item set can be found by looking at the symbols (terminals and nonterminals) found following the dots; in the case of item set 0 those symbols are the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminals E and B. To find the item set that each symbol formula_1leads to, the following procedure is followed for each of the symbols:\nBULLET::::1. Take the subset, \"S\", of all items in the current item set where there is a dot in front of the symbol of interest, \"x\".\nBULLET::::2. For each item in \"S\", move the dot to the right of \"x\".\nBULLET::::3. Close the resulting set of items.\n\nFor the terminal '0' (i.e. where x = '0') this results in:\n\nand for the terminal '1' (i.e. where x = '1') this results in:\n\nand for the nonterminal E (i.e. where x = E) this results in:\n\nand for the nonterminal B (i.e. where x = B) this results in:\n\nThe closure does not add new items in all cases - in the new sets above, for example, there are no nonterminals following the dot.\n\nAbove procedure is continued until no more new item sets are found. For the item sets 1, 2, and 4 there will be no transitions since the dot is not in front of any symbol. For item set 3 though, we have dots in front of terminals '*' and '+'. For symbol formula_2the transition goes to:\n\nand for formula_3the transition goes to:\n\nNow, the third iteration begins.\n\nFor item set 5, the terminals '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but the resulting closed item sets are equal to already found item sets 1 and 2, respectively. For the nonterminal B, the transition goes to:\n\nFor item set 6, the terminal '0' and '1' and the nonterminal B must be considered, but as before, the resulting item sets for the terminals are equal to the already found item sets 1 and 2. For the nonterminal B the transition goes to:\n\nThese final item sets 7 and 8 have no symbols beyond their dots so no more new item sets are added, so the item generating procedure is complete. The finite automaton, with item sets as its states is shown below.\n\nThe transition table for the automaton now looks as follows:\n\n! style=\"background:#d0e0ff; width:28%;\"Item Set\n+\n0\n1\nE\nB\n!0 \n    1 2 3 4\n!1 \n\n!2 \n\n!3 \n5 6        \n!4 \n\n!5 \n    1 2   7\n!6 \n    1 2   8\n!7 \n\n!8 \n\nFrom this table and the found item sets, the action and goto table are constructed as follows:\nBULLET::::1. The columns for nonterminals are copied to the goto table.\nBULLET::::2. The columns for the terminals are copied to the action table as shift actions.\nBULLET::::3. An extra column for '$' (end of input) is added to the action table that contains \"acc\" for every item set that contains an item of the form S → w eof.\nBULLET::::4. If an item set \"i\" contains an item of the form \"A\" → \"w\" and \"A\" → \"w\" is rule \"m\" with \"m\" > 0 then the row for state \"i\" in the action table is completely filled with the reduce action r\"m\".\nThe reader may verify that this results indeed in the action and goto table that were presented earlier on.\n\nOnly step 4 of the above procedure produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire table row, causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream. This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don't do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform. A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse table row containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.\nRefinements to the LR(0) table construction procedure (such as SLR and LALR) are capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows. Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers.\n\nThe automaton is constructed in such a way that it is guaranteed to be deterministic. However, when reduce actions are added to the action table it can happen that the same cell is filled with a reduce action and a shift action (a \"shift-reduce conflict\") or with two different reduce actions (a \"reduce-reduce conflict\"). However, it can be shown that when this happens the grammar is not an LR(0) grammar. A classic real-world example of a shift-reduce conflict is the dangling else problem.\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a shift-reduce conflict is:\n\nOne of the item sets found is:\n\nThere is a shift-reduce conflict in this item set: when constructing the action table according to the rules above, the cell for [item set 1, terminal '1'] contains s1 (shift to state 1) and r2 (reduce with grammar rule 2).\n\nA small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a reduce-reduce conflict is:\n\nIn this case the following item set is obtained:\n\nThere is a reduce-reduce conflict in this item set because in the cells in the action table for this item set there will be both a reduce action for rule 3 and one for rule 4.\n\nBoth examples above can be solved by letting the parser use the follow set (see LL parser) of a nonterminal \"A\" to decide if it is going to use one of \"A\"s rules for a reduction; it will only use the rule \"A\" → \"w\" for a reduction if the next symbol on the input stream is in the follow set of \"A\". This solution results in so-called Simple LR parsers.\n\nBULLET::::- Canonical LR parser\nBULLET::::- Simple LR\nBULLET::::- Look-Ahead LR\nBULLET::::- Generalized LR\n\nBULLET::::- Chapman, Nigel P., \"LR Parsing: Theory and Practice\", Cambridge University Press, 1987.\nBULLET::::- Pager, D., A Practical General Method for Constructing LR(k) Parsers.

{"id": "18031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18031", "title": "Leon Battista Alberti", "text": "Leon Battista Alberti\n\nLeon Battista Alberti (; February 14, 1404 – April 25, 1472) was an Italian Renaissance humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer; he epitomised the Renaissance Man. Although he is often characterized exclusively as an architect, as James Beck has observed, \"to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts.\" Although Alberti is known mostly for being an artist, he was also a mathematician of many sorts and made great advances to this field during the 15th century. Alberti's life was described in Giorgio Vasari's \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects.\n\nLeon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa. His mother is not known, and his father was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied Law at Bologna. He lived for a time in Florence, then travelled to Rome in 1431 where he took holy orders and entered the service of the papal court. During this time he studied the ancient ruins, which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.\n\nAlberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a man's head. He distinguished himself as a writer while he was still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play which was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature. In 1435, he began his first major written work, \"Della pittura,\" which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early 15th century. In this work he analyses the nature of painting and explores the elements of perspective, composition and colour.\n\nIn 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara, for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father. In 1447 he became the architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved with several projects at the Vatican.\n\nHis first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the facade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel, the Tempio Malatestiano. In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the facade for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years. In 1452, he completed \"De re aedificatoria\", a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of Vitruvius and influenced by the archaeological remains of Rome. The work was not published until 1485. It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, \"De statua\", in which he examines sculpture. Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to Pisanello.\n\nAlberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua, San Sebastiano, which was never completed, and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated upon, and the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death, but was brought to completion and is his most significant work.\n\nAs an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the ordinary craftsman, educated in workshops. He was a humanist, and part of the rapidly expanding entourage of intellectuals and artisans supported by the courts of the princes and lords of the time. Alberti, as a member of noble family and as part of the Roman curia, had special status. He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara, and in Urbino he spent part of the hot-weather season with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro. The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander, who generously spent money on the patronage of art. Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to his friend.\n\nAmong Alberti's smaller studies, pioneering in their field, were a treatise in cryptography, \"De componendis cifris\", and the first Italian grammar. With the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli he collaborated in astronomy, a close science to geography at that time, and produced a small Latin work on geography, \"Descriptio urbis Romae\" (\"The Panorama of the City of Rome\"). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed \"De iciarchia\" (\"On Ruling the Household\"), a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule.\n\nAlberti, having taken holy orders, remained unmarried all his life. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, for whom he wrote a panegyric, (\"Canis\"). Vasari describes him as \"an admirable citizen, a man of culture... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.\" Alberti died in Rome on April 25, 1472 at the age of 68.\n\nAlberti regarded mathematics as the common ground of art and the sciences. \"To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting,\" Alberti began his treatise, \"Della Pittura\" (On Painting), \"I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.\"\n\n\"Della pittura\" (also known in Latin as \"De Pictura\") relied in its scientific content on classical optics in determining perspective as a geometric instrument of artistic and architectural representation. Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of optics was connected to the handed-down long-standing tradition of the \"Kitab al-manazir\" (\"The Optics\"; \"De aspectibus\") of the Arab polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, d. c. 1041), which was mediated by Franciscan optical workshops of the 13th-century \"Perspectivae\" traditions of scholars such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Witelo (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of Lorenzo Ghiberti, \"Commentario terzo\").\n\nIn both \"Della pittura\" and \"De statua\", Alberti stressed that \"all steps of learning should be sought from nature.\" The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive \"through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature.\" However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, \"for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary.\" The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti \"the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,\" and subsequently \"this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony.\" Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.\n\nIn Rome, Alberti had plenty of time to study its ancient sites, ruins, and objects. His detailed observations, included in his \"De re aedificatoria\" (1452, \"On the Art of Building\"), were patterned after the \"De architectura\" by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (fl. 46–30 BC). The work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, and engineering to the philosophy of beauty. \"De re aedificatoria,\" a large and expensive book, was not fully published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects. However, the book was written \"not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts,\" as Alberti put it. Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by Cosimo Bartoli was published in 1550. Pope Nicholas V, to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars and others.\n\nAlberti wrote \"I Libri della famiglia\"—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like Erasmus decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that \"the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother,\" and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet. With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that \"he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it.\" \"Momus\", written between 1443 and 1450, was a misogynist comedy about the Olympian gods. It has been considered as a roman à clef—Jupiter has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from Lucian, one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, Momus, the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other gods come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.\n\nAlberti did not concern himself with the practicalities of building, and very few of his major works were brought to completion. As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman remains, he grasped the nature of column and lintel architecture, from the visual rather than structural viewpoint, and correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who utilised the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Among Alberti's concerns was the social effect of architecture, and to this end he was very well aware of the cityscape. This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement. Alberti anticipated the principle of street hierarchy, with wide main streets connected to secondary streets, and buildings of equal height.\n\nIn Rome he was employed by Pope Nicholas V for the restoration of the Roman aqueduct of Acqua Vergine, which debouched into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was swept away later by the Baroque Trevi Fountain.\n\nSome studies propose that the Villa Medici in Fiesole might owe its design to Alberti, not to Michelozzo, and that it then became the prototype of the Renaissance villa. This hilltop dwelling, commissioned by Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo il Vecchio's second son, with its view over the city, may be the very first example of a Renaissance villa: that is to say it follows the Albertian criteria for rendering a country dwelling a \"villa suburbana\". Under this perspective the Villa Medici in Fiesole could therefore be considered the \"muse\" for numerous other buildings, not only in the Florence area, which from the end of the 15th century onwards find inspiration and creative innovation here.\n\nThe Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (1447, 1453–60) is the rebuilding of a Gothic church. The facade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.\n\nThe design of the façade of the Palazzo Rucellai (1446–51) was one of several commissions for the Rucellai family. The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in the Classical manner onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has Corinthian columns. The palace set a standard in the use of Classical elements that is original in civic buildings in Florence, and greatly influenced later palazzi. The work was executed by Bernardo Rosselino.\n\nAt Santa Maria Novella, Florence, between (1448–70) the upper facade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six Gothic niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches such as San Miniato al Monte and the Baptistery of Florence. The design also incorporates an ocular window which was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire facade in a manner which includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of Church facades in the later Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Revival buildings.\n\nAlberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, Pienza. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459. It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius II, in whose employ Alberti served. Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.\n\nThe piazza is a trapezoid shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, \"Palazzo Piccolomini\", is on the west side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by loggia on all three floors that overlook an enclosed Italian Renaissance garden with \"Giardino all'italiana\" era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the Val d'Orcia and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond. Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for 100 horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.\n\nThe Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua was begun in 1471, the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the triumphal arch motif, both for its facade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow. Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike Brunelleschi, he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.\n\nBULLET::::- San Sebastiano, Mantua, (begun 1458) the unfinished facade of which has promoted much speculation as to Alberti's intention\nBULLET::::- Sepolcro Rucellai in San Pancrazio, 1467)\nBULLET::::- The Tribune for Santissima Annunziata, Florence (1470, completed with alterations, 1477)\n\nGiorgio Vasari, who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in Michelangelo, emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: \"He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.\" Leonardo, who ironically called himself \"an uneducated person\" (\"omo senza lettere\"), followed Alberti in the view that painting is science. However, as a scientist Leonardo was more empirical than Alberti, who was a theorist and did not have similar interest in practice. Alberti believed in ideal beauty, but Leonardo filled his notebooks with observations on human proportions, page after page, ending with his famous drawing of the Vitruvian man, a human figure related to a square and a circle.\n\nIn \"On Painting\", Alberti uses the expression \"We Painters\", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. \"In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty,\" wrote Vasari. \"The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.\" Jacob Burckhardt portrayed Alberti in \"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy\" as a truly universal genius. \"And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.\"\n\nAlberti is said to be in Mantegna's great frescoes in the Camera degli Sposi, the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of Ludovico Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua. In Alberti's self-portrait, a large plaquette, he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, \"Quid tum?\" (what then), taken from Virgil's \"Eclogues\": \"So what, if Amyntas is dark? (\"quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?\") Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.\"\n\nAlberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:\nBULLET::::- Alberti was the creator of a theory called \"historia\". In his treatise \"De pictura\" (1435) he explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and \"hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion\". \"De pictura\" (\"On Painting\") contained the first scientific study of perspective. An Italian translation of \"De pictura\" (\"Della pittura\") was published in 1436, one year after the original Latin version and addressed Filippo Brunelleschi in the preface. The Latin version had been dedicated to Alberti's humanist patron, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Mantua. He also wrote works on [sculpture], \"\".\nBULLET::::- Alberti used his artistic treatises to propound a new humanistic theory of art. He drew on his contacts with early Quattrocento artists such as Brunelleschi, Donatello and Ghiberti to provide a practical handbook for the renaissance artist.\nBULLET::::- Alberti wrote an influential work on architecture, \"De Re Aedificatoria\", which by the 16th century had been translated into Italian (by Cosimo Bartoli), French, Spanish and English. An English translation was by Giacomo Leoni in the early 18th century. Newer translations are now available.\nBULLET::::- Whilst Alberti's treatises on painting and architecture have been hailed as the founding texts of a new form of art, breaking from the Gothic past, it is impossible to know the extent of their practical impact within his lifetime. His praise of the \"Calumny of Apelles\" led to several attempts to emulate it, including paintings by Botticelli and Signorelli. His stylistic ideals have been put into practice in the works of Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Fra Angelico. But how far Alberti was responsible for these innovations and how far he was simply articulating the trends of the artistic movement, with which his practical experience had made him familiar, is impossible to ascertain.\nBULLET::::- He was so skilled in Latin verse that a comedy he wrote in his twentieth year, entitled \"Philodoxius\", would later deceive the younger Aldus Manutius, who edited and published it as the genuine work of 'Lepidus Comicus'.\n\nBULLET::::- He has been credited with being the author, or alternatively the designer of the woodcut illustrations, of the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\", a strange fantasy novel.\nBULLET::::- Apart from his treatises on the arts, Alberti also wrote: \"Philodoxus\" (\"Lover of Glory\", 1424), \"De commodis litterarum atque incommodis\" (\"On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Literary Studies\", 1429), \"Intercoenales\" (\"Table Talk\", c. 1429), \"Della famiglia\" (\"On the Family\", begun 1432) \"Vita S. Potiti\" (\"Life of St. Potitus\", 1433), \"De iure\" (On Law, 1437), \"Theogenius\" (\"The Origin of the Gods\", c. 1440), \"Profugorium ab aerumna\" (\"Refuge from Mental Anguish\",), \"Momus\" (1450) and \"De Iciarchia\" (\"On the Prince\", 1468). These and other works were translated and printed in Venice by the humanist Cosimo Bartoli in 1586.\nBULLET::::- Alberti was an accomplished cryptographer by the standard of his day, and invented the first polyalphabetic cipher, which is now known as the Alberti cipher, and machine-assisted encryption using his Cipher Disk. The polyalphabetic cipher was, at least in principle, for it was not properly used for several hundred years, the most significant advance in cryptography since before Julius Caesar's time. Cryptography historian David Kahn titles him the \"Father of Western Cryptography\", pointing to three significant advances in the field which can be attributed to Alberti: \"the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code.\"\nBULLET::::- According to Alberti himself, in a short autobiography written c. 1438 in Latin and in the third person, (many but not all scholars consider this work to be an autobiography) he was capable of \"standing with his feet together, and springing over a man's head.\" The autobiography survives thanks to an 18th-century transcription by Antonio Muratori. Alberti also claimed that he \"excelled in all bodily exercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man; could in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains.\" Needless to say, many in the Renaissance promoted themselves in various ways and Alberti's eagerness to promote his skills should be understood, to some extent, within that framework. (This advice should be followed in reading the above information, some of which originates in this so-called autobiography.)\nBULLET::::- Alberti claimed in his \"autobiography\" to be an accomplished musician and organist, but there is no hard evidence to support this claim. In fact, musical posers were not uncommon in his day (see the lyrics to the song \"Musica Son\", by Francesco Landini, for complaints to this effect.) He held the appointment of canon in the metropolitan church of Florence, and thus – perhaps – had the leisure to devote himself to this art, but this is only speculation. Vasari also agreed with this.\nBULLET::::- He was also interested in the drawing of maps and worked with the astronomer, astrologer, and cartographer Paolo Toscanelli.\nBULLET::::- In terms of Aesthetics Alberti is one of the first defining the work of art as imitation of nature, exactly as a selection of its most beautiful parts: \"So let's take from nature what we are going to paint, and from nature we choose the most beautiful and worthy things\"\n\nBULLET::::- \"De Pictura\", 1435. \"On Painting\", in English, \"De Pictura\", in Latin, ; \"Della Pittura\", in Italian (1804 [1434]).\nBULLET::::- \"Momus,\" Latin text and English translation, 2003\nBULLET::::- \"De re aedificatoria\" (1452, Ten Books on Architecture).

{"id": "18033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18033", "title": "Little Nemo", "text": "Little Nemo\n\nLittle Nemo is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\", before receiving his own spin-off series, Little Nemo in Slumberland. The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay's masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" ran in the \"New York Herald\" from October 15, 1905, until July 23, 1911. The strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\", where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914. When McCay returned to the \"Herald\" in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from August 3, 1924, until December 26, 1926, when McCay returned to Hearst.\n\nA weekly fantasy adventure, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" featured the young Nemo (\"No one\" in Latin) who dreamed himself into wondrous predicaments from which he awoke in bed in the last panel. The first episode begins with a command from King Morpheus of Slumberland to a minion to collect Nemo. Nemo was to be the playmate of Slumberland's Princess, but it took months of adventures before Nemo finally arrived; a green, cigar-chewing clown named Flip was determined to disturb Nemo's sleep with a top hat emblazoned with the words \"Wake Up.\" Nemo and Flip eventually become companions, and are joined by an African Imp whom Flip finds in the Candy Islands. The group travels far and wide, from shanty towns to Mars, to Jack Frost's palace, to the bizarre architecture and distorted funhouse-mirror illusions of Befuddle Hall.\n\nThe strip shows McCay's understanding of dream psychology, particularly of dream fears—falling, drowning, impalement. This dream world has its own moral code, perhaps difficult to understand. Breaking it has terrible consequences, as when Nemo ignores instructions not to touch Queen Crystalette, who inhabits a cave of glass. Overcome with his infatuation, he causes her and her followers to shatter, and awakens with \"the groans of the dying guardsmen still ringing in his ears\".\n\nAlthough the strip began October 15, 1905 with Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, making his first attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm, Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906 and, due to Flip's interfering, did not get to see the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always interrupted by either him falling out of bed, or his parents forcibly waking him up.\n\nOn July 12, 1908, McCay made a major change of direction: Flip visits Nemo and tells him that he has had his uncle destroy Slumberland. (Slumberland had been dissolved before, into day, but this time it appeared to be permanent.) After this, Nemo's dreams take place in his home town, though Flip—and a curious-looking boy named the Professor—accompany him. These adventures range from the down-to-earth to Rarebit-fiend type fantasy; one very commonplace dream had the Professor pelting people with snowballs. The famous \"walking bed\" story was in this period. Slumberland continued to make sporadic appearances until it returned for good on December 26, 1909.\n\nStory-arcs included Befuddle Hall, a voyage to Mars (with a well-realized Martian civilization), and a trip around the world (including a tour of New York City).\n\nMcCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, and architectural and other detail. From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo. In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a giant turkey gobbling Nemo's house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page. McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters. Narrative pacing McCay controlled through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.\n\nIn his familiar Art Nouveau-influenced style McCay outlined his characters in heavy blacks. Slumberland's ornate architecture was reminiscent of the architecture designed by McKim, Mead & White for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as Luna Park and Dreamland in Coney Island, and the Parisian Luxembourg Palace.\n\nMcCay made imaginative use of color, sometimes changing the backgrounds' or characters' colors from panel to panel in a psychedelic imitation of a dream experience. The colors were enhanced by the careful attention and advanced Ben Day lithographic process employed by the \"Herald\"s printing staff. McCay annotated the \"Nemo\" pages for the printers with the precise color schemes he wanted.\n\nFor the first five months the pages were accompanied with captions beneath them, and at first the captions were numbered. In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and \"disfigur otherwise flawless work\", according to critic R. C. Harvey. The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights what seems to be the little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition. They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCay's gift was in the visual and not the verbal.\n\nMcCay used traditional ethnic stereotypes prominently in \"Little Nemo\", as in the ill-tempered Irishman Flip, and the nearly-mute African Impie.\n\nWinsor McCay ( – 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist in carnivals and dime museums before he began working for newspapers and magazines in 1898. In 1903, he joined the staff of the \"New York Herald\" family of newspapers, where he had success with comic strips such as \"Little Sammy Sneeze\" (1904–06). and \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" (1904–11)\n\nIn 1905, McCay got \"an idea from the \"Rarebit Fiend\" to please the little folk\". In That October, the full-page Sunday strip \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted in the \"Herald\". Considered McCay's masterpiece, its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert, had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel. McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail. The \"Herald\" was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time. Its printing staff used the Ben Day process for color.\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" debuted on the last page of the Sunday comics section of \"The New York Herald\" on October 15, 1905. The full-page, color comic strip ran until July 23, 1911. In spring 1911, McCay moved to William Randolph Hearst's \"New York American\" and took \"Little Nemo\"s characters with him. The \"Herald\" held the strip's copyright, but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters. In the \"American\", the strip ran under the title \"In the Land of Wonderful Dreams\". The \"Herald\" was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.\n\nMcCay left Hearst in May 1924 and returned to the \"Herald Tribune\". He began \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" afresh that August 3. The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories, and there was no continuity. The strip came to an end in December 1926, as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the \"American\", and succeeded in 1927. Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo's success, the \"Herald Tribune\" signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.\n\nIn 1937, McCay's son Robert attempted to carry on his father's legacy by reviving \"Little Nemo\". Comic book packager Harry \"A\" Chesler's syndicate announced a Sunday and daily \"Nemo\" strip, credited to \"Winsor McCay, Jr.\" Robert also drew a comic-book version for Chesler called \"Nemo in Adventureland\" featuring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original \"Nemo\" strip from McCay's original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.\n\nIn 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many \"Little Nemo\" strips at a cartoon studio where McCay's son Bob had worked. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of \"Little Nemo\" strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University.\n\nCollector Peter Maresca self-published a volume of \"Nemo\" Sundays as \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!\". The volume was large enough to reproduce the pages at the size they originally appeared in newspapers. Restoration work took Maresca five to twenty hours per page. A second volume, \"Little Nemo in Slumberland: Many More Splendid Sundays!\", appeared in 2008.\n\nAs early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to put \"Little Nemo\" on stage. In summer 1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant \"Little Nemo\" show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It starred dwarf Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. Reviews were positive, and it played to sold-out houses in New York. It went on the road for two seasons. McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where \"Little Nemo\" played. When a Keith circuit refused to let McCay perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. In several cities, McCay brought his son, who sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo as publicity.\n\nAs part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a \"Whiffenpoof\". The word stuck with the public, and became the name of a and a singing group. One reviewer of the 1908 operetta gave a paragraph of praise to the comic hunting tales presented in a scene in which three hunters are trying to outdo each other with hunting stories about the \"montimanjack\", the \"peninsula\", and the \"whiffenpoof\". He calls it \"one of the funniest yarns ever spun\" and compares it favorably to Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark. One source indicates that the dialogue in fact began as an ad lib by actor Joseph Cawthorn, covering for some kind of backstage problem during a performance. The Word is also referred in one of the Little Nemo comic strips published in 1909 (April 11). After being held down by nine policemen during a hysteria crisis, Nemo’s father tells the doctor: “Just keep those whiffenpoofs away. Will you?”.\n\nDespite the show's success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses, and came to an end in December 1910.\nIn mid-2012 Toronto-based theatre company Frolick performed an adaptation of the strip into \"Adventures in Slumberland\", a multimedia show featuring puppets large and small and a score that included as a refrain \"Wake Up Little Nemo\", set to the tune of The Everly Brothers' 1957 hit \"Wake Up Little Susie\". Talespinner Children's Theatre in Cleveland, OH produced a scaled-down, \"colorful and high-energy 45-minute\" adaptation in 2013, \"Adventures In Slumberland\" by David Hansen.\n\nIn March 2017, a short, one-act adaptation of the \"Little Nemo\" adventures was staged at Fordham University in New York City. The play, simply entitled \"Little Nemo in Slumberland\", was written by Aladdin Lee Grant Rutledge Collar, and directed by student Peter McNally. The six person cast, as well as creative team, consisted of students and alums at the university.\n\nMcCay played an important role in the early history of animation. In 1911 he completed his first film, \"Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics\" (also known as \"Little Nemo\"), first in theatres and then as part of his vaudeville act. McCay made the 4,000 rice-paper drawings for the animated portion of the film. The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length. Photography was done at the Vitagraph Studios under the supervision of animation pioneer James Stuart Blackton. During the live-action portion of the film, McCay bets his colleagues he can make his drawings move. He wins the bet by animating his \"Little Nemo\" characters, who shapeshift and transform.\n\nIn 1984, Arnaud Sélignac produced and directed a film called \"Nemo\" or \"Dream One\", starring Jason Connery, Harvey Keitel and Carole Bouquet. It involves a little boy called Nemo, who wears pajamas and travels to a fantasy world, but otherwise the connection to McCay's strip is a loose one. The fantasy world is a dark and dismal beach, and Nemo encounters characters from other works of fiction rather than those from the original strip. Instead of Flip or the Princess, Nemo meets Zorro, Alice and Jules Verne's Nautilus (which was led by Captain Nemo).\n\nA joint American-Japanese feature-length film \"\" was released in 1989, with contributions by Ray Bradbury, Chris Columbus and Moebius, and music by the Sherman Brothers. The story tells of a quest by Nemo and friends to rescue King Morpheus from the Nightmare King. The Princess is given a name, Camille, and Nemo has a pet squirrel named Icarus.\n\nThe Sarasota Opera commissioned composer Daron Hagen and librettist J. D. McClatchy to create an opera based on \"Little Nemo\". Two casts of children alternated performances when it debuted in November 2012. The dreamlike nonlinear story told of Nemo, the Princess, and their comrades trying to prevent the Emperor of Sol and the Guardian of Dawn from bringing daylight to Slumberland. Special effects and shifting backgrounds were produced with projections onto a scaffolding of boxes. The work was first performed on November 10 and 11, 2012, by members of the Sarasota Opera, Sarasota Youth Opera, Sarasota Prep Chorus, The Sailor Circus and students from Booker High school.\n\nIn 1990, Capcom produced a video game for the NES, titled \"\" (known as \"Pajama Hero Nemo\" in Japan), a licensed game based on the 1989 film. The film would not see a US release until 1992, two years after the game's Japanese release, so the game is often thought to be a standalone adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", not related to the film. An arcade game called simply \"Nemo\" was also released in 1990.\n\nThroughout the years, various pieces of Little Nemo merchandise have been produced. In 1941, Rand, McNally & Co. published a Little Nemo children's storybook. \"Little Nemo in Slumberland in 3-D\" was released by Blackthorne Publishing in 1987; this reprinted Little Nemo issues with 3-D glasses. A set of 30 Little Nemo postcards was available through Stewart Tabori & Chang in 1996. In 1993, as promotion for the 1989 animated film, Hemdale produced a Collector's Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. In 2001, Dark Horse Comics released a Little Nemo statue and tin lunchbox.\n\nLittle Nemo itself is influenced by children stories in general, and some French comic pages in particular.\nSince its publishing, \"Little Nemo\" has had an influence on other artists, including Peter Newell (\"The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead\"), Frank King (\"Bobby Make-Believe\"), Clare Briggs (\"Danny Dreamer\") or George McManus (\"Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland\"). Through the Paris edition of the New York Herald, his influence reached France and other European countries.\n\nIn children's literature, Maurice Sendak said that this strip inspired his book \"In the Night Kitchen\", and William Joyce included several elements from Little Nemo in his children's book \"Santa Calls\", including appearances by Flip and the walking bed. Another tribute to Little Nemo is the comic, then made into a short film, \"Little Remo in Pinchmeland\", by Ellen Duthie and Daniela Martagón. \n\nThe character and themes from the comic strip \"Little Nemo\" were used in a song \"Scenes from a Night's Dream\" written by Tony Banks and Phil Collins of the progressive rock group Genesis on their 1978 recording, \"...And Then There Were Three...\".\n\nAnother progressive rock group, from Germany, called Scara Brae also recorded a musical impression of the comic on their rare self-titled disc from 1981 (the track was actually recorded 2 years earlier). Their concept piece was revived on the second album by the Greek band Anger Department, oddly called 'The Strange Dreams of A Rarebit Fiend', again after a McCay-comic. Their 'Little Nemo' was chosen for a theatre play, which was suggested for the cultural program for the Olympic Games in 2004.\n\nIn 1984, Italian comic artist Vittorio Giardino started producing a number of stories under the title \"Little Ego\", a parodic adaptation of \"Little Nemo\", in the shape of adult-oriented erotic comics. Brian Bolland's early comic strip \"Little Nympho in Slumberland\" employed a similar technique.\n\nThe bar in \"Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\" is called 'Little Nemo's'.\n\nIt influenced Alan Moore, in \"Miracleman\" No. 4, when the Miracleman family end up in a palace called \"Sleepy Town\", which has imagery similar to Little Nemo's. In Moore (and J.H. Williams III)'s \"Promethea\", a more direct pastiche – \"Little Margie in Misty Magic Land\" – showed Moore's inspiration and debt to McCay's landmark 1905 strip. The Sandman series occasionally references \"Little Nemo\" as well. Examples include \"\", where an abused child escapes into dreams styled after McCay's comics and using a similar 'wake-up' mechanism, and \"\" (pub. 1996), which features George Alec Effinger's short \"Seven Nights in Slumberland\" (where Nemo interacts with Neil Gaiman's characters The Endless).\n\nIn 1989, teen comic book Power Pack ran an issue (#47) which paid direct homage to one of McCay's Nemo storylines, featuring a castle that was drawn sideways and Katie Power re-enacting a classic Nemo panel with a sideways-drawn hallway that served as a bottomless pit with the line \"Don't fall in, y'hear?\"\n\n\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\" is also the inspiration for the video of the 1989 song \"Runnin' Down a Dream\" by Tom Petty.\n\nIn 1994-1995, French artist Moebius wrote the story to a sequel comic series \"Little Nemo\", drawn by Bruno Marchand in two albums, 2000-2002, Marchand continued the story with two additional albums.\n\nIn 2006, electronic artist Daedelus used Little Nemo artwork for his album \"Denies the Day's Demise\".\n\nThe comic strip \"Cul de Sac\" includes a strip-within-the-strip, \"Little Neuro\", a parody of Little Nemo. Neuro is a little boy who hardly ever leaves his bed.\n\nIn 2009, the Pittsburgh ToonSeum established its NEMO Award, given to notable individuals \"for excellence in the cartoon arts\". Recipients to date include veteran comic-book artist Ron Frenz, editorial and comic-strip artist Dick Locher, cartoonist and comics historian Trina Robbins, and comics artist, editorial cartoonist and artists' rights advocate Jerry Robinson.\n\nOn October 15, 2012, celebrating the 107th anniversary of the first \"Little Nemo\" story, Google displayed an interactive animated \"Google Doodle\" called \"Little Nemo in Google-land\" on its homepage. The doodle showed a typical Little Nemo adventure through a series of panels, each featuring a letter from the word \"Google\". The doodle also ends in the same way as the comic strips, with Nemo falling from his bed.\n\nAt Universal's Islands of Adventure, at the Toon Lagoon section, Little Nemo can be seen falling out of his bed near a shop.\n\nEric Shanower and Gabriel Rodriguez revived the characters in 2014 in an IDW comic book series entitled \"Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland\". That same year, Locust Moon Press released a new anthology and Taschen published the complete series (1905–1926).\n\nComics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay \"the first original genius of the comic strip medium\". Harvey claims that McCay's contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon. Cartoonist Robert Crumb called McCay a \"genius\" and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman's \"In the Shadow of No Towers\" (2004) appropriated some of McCay's imagery, and included a page of \"Little Nemo\" in its appendix. Federico Fellini read \"Little Nemo\" in the children's magazine \"Il corriere dei piccoli\", and the strip was a \"powerful influence\" on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.\n\nMcCay's original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection survived him, but much of it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection into his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay's surviving artwork remained in family hands.\n\nBULLET::::- (on included DVD)\nBULLET::::- \"Little Nemo\" and other public-domain McCay strips for download at The Comic Strip Library.

{"id": "18039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18039", "title": "Lydia", "text": "Lydia\n\nLydia (Assyrian: \"Luddu\"; , \"Lȳdíā\"; ) was an Iron Age kingdom of western Asia Minor located generally east of ancient Ionia in the modern western Turkish provinces of Uşak, Manisa and inland İzmir. Its population spoke an Anatolian language known as Lydian. Its capital was Sardis.\n\nThe Kingdom of Lydia existed from about 1200 BC to 546 BC. At its greatest extent, during the 7th century BC, it covered all of western Anatolia. In 546 BC, it became a province of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, known as the satrapy of Lydia or \"Sparda\" in Old Persian. In 133 BC, it became part of the Roman province of Asia.\n\nCoins are said to have been invented in Lydia around the 7th century BC.\n\nThe endonym \"Śfard\" (the name the Lydians called themselves) survives in bilingual and trilingual stone-carved notices of the Achaemenid Empire: the satrapy of \"Sparda\" (Old Persian), Aramaic \"Saparda\", Babylonian \"Sapardu\", Elamitic \"Išbarda\", Hebrew . These in the Greek tradition are associated with Sardis, the capital city of King Gyges, constructed during the 7th century BC. Lydia is called \"Kisitan\" in \"The Flower of the History of the East\" by Hayton of Corycus, which was corrupted to \"Quesiton\" in \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\". \n\nThe region of the Lydian kingdom was during the 15th-14th centuries part of the Arzawa kingdom. However, the Lydian language is usually not categorized as part of the Luwic subgroup, unlike the other nearby Anatolian languages Luwian, Carian, and Lycian.\nAn Etruscan/Lydian association has long been a subject of conjecture. The Greek historian Herodotus stated that the Etruscans came from Lydia, repeated in Virgil's epic poem the \"Aeneid\", and Etruscan-like language was found on the Lemnos stele from the Aegean Sea island of Lemnos. However, the decipherment of Lydian and its classification as an Anatolian language mean that Etruscan and Lydian were not even part of the same language family. Furthermore, a mitochondrial DNA study (2013) suggests that the Etruscans were probably an indigenous population, showing that Etruscans appear to fall very close to a Neolithic population from Central Europe and to other Tuscan populations, strongly suggesting that the Etruscan civilization developed locally from the Villanovan culture, with the most likely separation time between Tuscany and Western Anatolia falling around 7,600 years ago, with a 95% credible interval between 5,000 and 10,000.\n\nThe boundaries of historical Lydia varied across the centuries. It was bounded first by Mysia, Caria, Phrygia and coastal Ionia. Later, the military power of Alyattes and Croesus expanded Lydia, which, with its capital at Sardis, controlled all Asia Minor west of the River Halys, except Lycia. After the Persian conquest the River Maeander was regarded as its southern boundary, and during imperial Roman times Lydia comprised the country between Mysia and Caria on the one side and Phrygia and the Aegean Sea on the other.\n\nThe Lydian language was an Indo-European language in the Anatolian language family, related to Luwian and Hittite. Due to its fragmentary attestation, the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined. Similar to other Anatolian languages, it featured extensive use of prefixes and grammatical particles to chain clauses together. Lydian had also undergone extensive syncope, leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of Indo-European languages. Lydian finally became extinct during the 1st century BC.\n\nLydia developed after the decline of the Hittite Empire in the 12th century BC. In Hittite times, the name for the region had been Arzawa. According to Greek source, the original name of the Lydian kingdom was \"Maionia\" (Μαιονία), or \"Maeonia\": Homer (\"Iliad\" ii. 865; v. 43, xi. 431) refers to the inhabitants of Lydia as \"Maiones\" (Μαίονες). Homer describes their capital not as Sardis but as \"Hyde\" (\"Iliad\" xx. 385); Hyde may have been the name of the district in which Sardis was located. Later, Herodotus (\"Histories\" i. 7) adds that the \"Meiones\" were renamed Lydians after their king Lydus (Λυδός), son of Atys, during the mythical epoch that preceded the Heracleid dynasty. This etiological eponym served to account for the Greek ethnic name \"Lydoi\" (Λυδοί). The Hebrew term for Lydians, \"Lûḏîm\" (לודים), as found in the Book of Jeremiah (46.9), has been similarly considered, beginning with Flavius Josephus, to be derived from Lud son of Shem; however, Hippolytus of Rome (234 AD) offered an alternative opinion that the Lydians were descended from Ludim, son of Mizraim. During Biblical times, the Lydian warriors were famous archers. Some Maeones still existed during historical times in the upland interior along the River Hermus, where a town named Maeonia existed, according to Pliny the Elder (\"Natural History\" book v:30) and Hierocles (author of Synecdemus).\n\nLydian mythology is virtually unknown, and their literature and rituals have been lost due to the absence of any monuments or archaeological finds with extensive inscriptions; therefore, myths involving Lydia are mainly from Greek mythology.\n\nFor the Greeks, Tantalus was a primordial ruler of mythic Lydia, and Niobe his proud daughter; her husband Amphion associated Lydia with Thebes in Greece, and through Pelops the line of Tantalus was part of the founding myths of Mycenae's second dynasty. (In reference to the myth of Bellerophon, Karl Kerenyi remarked, in \"The Heroes of The Greeks\" 1959, p. 83. \"As Lykia was thus connected with Crete, and as the person of Pelops, the hero of Olympia, connected Lydia with the Peloponnesos, so Bellerophontes connected another Asian country, or rather two, Lykia and Karia, with the kingdom of Argos\".)\nIn Greek myth, Lydia had also adopted the double-axe symbol, that also appears in the Mycenaean civilization, the \"labrys\". Omphale, daughter of the river Iardanos, was a ruler of Lydia, whom Heracles was required to serve for a time. His adventures in Lydia are the adventures of a Greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land: during his stay, Heracles enslaved the Itones; killed Syleus, who forced passers-by to hoe his vineyard; slew the serpent of the river Sangarios (which appears in the heavens as the constellation Ophiucus) and captured the simian tricksters, the Cercopes. Accounts tell of at least one son of Heracles who was born to either Omphale or a slave-girl: Herodotus (\"Histories\" i. 7) says this was Alcaeus who began the line of Lydian Heracleidae which ended with the death of Candaules c. 687 BC. Diodorus Siculus (4.31.8) and Ovid (\"Heroides\" 9.54) mention a son called Lamos, while pseudo-Apollodorus (\"Bibliotheke\" 2.7.8) gives the name Agelaus and Pausanias (2.21.3) names Tyrsenus as the son of Heracles by \"the Lydian woman\". All three heroic ancestors indicate a Lydian dynasty claiming Heracles as their ancestor. Herodotus (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale. He also mentions (1.94) the legend that the Etruscan civilization was founded by colonists from Lydia led by Tyrrhenus, brother of Lydus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus was skeptical of this story, indicating that the Etruscan language and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the Lydians. In addition, the story of the \"Lydian\" origins of the Etruscans was not known to Xanthus of Lydia, an authority on the history of the Lydians.\n\nLater chronologists ignored Herodotus' statement that Agron was the first Heraclid to be a king, and included his immediate forefathers Alcaeus, Belus and Ninus in their list of kings of Lydia. Strabo (5.2.2) has Atys, father of Lydus and Tyrrhenus, as a descendant of Heracles and Omphale but that contradicts virtually all other accounts which name Atys, Lydus and Tyrrhenus among the pre-Heraclid kings and princes of Lydia. The gold deposits in the river Pactolus that were the source of the proverbial wealth of Croesus (Lydia's last king) were said to have been left there when the legendary king Midas of Phrygia washed away the \"Midas touch\" in its waters.\nIn Euripides' tragedy \"The Bacchae\", Dionysus, while he is maintaining his human disguise, declares his country to be Lydia.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to use gold and silver coins and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations. It is not known, however, whether Herodotus meant that the Lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general. Despite this ambiguity, this statement of Herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that Lydians invented coinage, at least in the West, although the first coins (under Alyattes I, reigned c.591–c.560 BC) were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called electrum.\n\nThe dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics, with dates ranging from 700 BC to 550 BC, but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of King Alyattes (sometimes referred to incorrectly as Alyattes II). The first coins were made of electrum, an alloy of gold and silver that occurs naturally but that was further debased by the Lydians with added silver and copper.\nThe largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1/3 stater (\"trite\") denomination, weighing around 4.7 grams, though no full staters of this type have ever been found, and the 1/3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater, after a type of a transversely held scale, the weights used in such a scale (from ancient Greek ίστημι=to stand), which also means \"standard.\" These coins were stamped with a lion's head adorned with what is likely a sunburst, which was the king's symbol. The most prolific mint for early electrum coins was Sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds, sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions. To complement the largest denomination, fractions were made, including a \"hekte\" (sixth), \"hemihekte\" (twelfth), and so forth down to a 96th, with the 1/96 stater weighing only about 0.15 grams. There is disagreement, however, over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually Lydian. \n\nAlyattes' son was Croesus (Reigned c.560–c.546 BC), who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the \"Croeseid\", the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, and the world's first bimetallic monetary system circa 550 BCE. \n\nIt took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. The first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted in Cyme (Aeolis) under Hermodike II then by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.\n\nSardis was renowned as a beautiful city. Around 550 BC, near the beginning of his reign, Croesus paid for the construction of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, which became one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Croesus was defeated in battle by Cyrus II of Persia in 546 BC, with the Lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a Persian satrapy.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, Lydia was ruled by three dynasties from the second millennium BC to 546 BC. The first two dynasties are legendary and the third is historical. Herodotus mentions three early Maeonian kings: Manes, his son Atys and his grandson Lydus. Lydus gave his name to the country and its people. One of his descendants was Iardanus, with whom Heracles was in service at one time. Heracles had an affair with one of Iardanus' slave-girls and their son Alcaeus was the first of the Lydian Heraclids. \n\nThe Maeonians relinquished control to the Heracleidae and Herodotus says they ruled through 22 generations for a total of 505 years from c. 1192 BC. The first Heraclid king was Agron, the great-grandson of Alcaeus. He was succeeded by 19 Heraclid kings, names unknown, all succeeding father to son. In the 8th century BC, Meles became the 21st and penultimate Heraclid king and the last was his son Candaules (died c. 687 BC), who was assassinated and succeeded by his former friend Gyges, who began the Mermnad dynasty.\n\nIn 547 BC, the Lydian king Croesus besieged and captured the Persian city of Pteria in Cappadocia and enslaved its inhabitants. The Persian king Cyrus The Great marched with his army against the Lydians. The Battle of Pteria resulted in a stalemate, forcing the Lydians to retreat to their capital city of Sardis. Some months later the Persian and Lydian kings met at the Battle of Thymbra. Cyrus won and captured the capital city of Sardis by 546 BC. Lydia became a province (satrapy) of the Persian Empire.\n\nLydia remained a satrapy after Persia's conquest by the Macedonian king Alexander III (the Great) of Macedon.\nWhen Alexander's empire ended after his death, Lydia was possessed by the major Asian diadoch dynasty, the Seleucids, and when it was unable to maintain its territory in Asia Minor, Lydia was acquired by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamum. Its last king avoided the spoils and ravage of a Roman war of conquest by leaving the realm by testament to the Roman Empire.\n\nWhen the Romans entered the capital Sardis in 133 BC, Lydia, as the other western parts of the Attalid legacy, became part of the province of Asia, a very rich Roman province, worthy of a governor with the high rank of proconsul. The whole west of Asia Minor had Jewish colonies very early, and Christianity was also soon present there. Acts of the Apostles 16:14-15 mentions the baptism of a merchant woman called \"Lydia\" from Thyatira, known as Lydia of Thyatira, in what had once been the satrapy of Lydia. Christianity spread rapidly during the 3rd century AD, based on the nearby Exarchate of Ephesus.\n\nUnder the tetrarchy reform of Emperor Diocletian in 296 AD, Lydia was revived as the name of a separate Roman province, much smaller than the former satrapy, with its capital at Sardis.\nTogether with the provinces of Caria, Hellespontus, Lycia, Pamphylia, Phrygia prima and Phrygia secunda, Pisidia (all in modern Turkey) and the Insulae (Ionian islands, mostly in modern Greece), it formed the diocese (under a \"vicarius\") of Asiana, which was part of the praetorian prefecture of Oriens, together with the dioceses Pontiana (most of the rest of Asia Minor), Oriens proper (mainly Syria), Aegyptus (Egypt) and Thraciae (on the Balkans, roughly Bulgaria).\nUnder the Byzantine emperor Heraclius (610–641), Lydia became part of Anatolikon, one of the original \"themata\", and later of Thrakesion. Although the Seljuk Turks conquered most of the rest of Anatolia, forming the Sultanate of Ikonion (Konya), Lydia remained part of the Byzantine Empire. While the Venetians occupied Constantinople and Greece as a result of the Fourth Crusade, Lydia continued as a part of the Byzantine rump state called the Nicene Empire based at Nicaea until 1261.\n\nLydia was captured finally by Turkish \"beyliks\", which were all absorbed by the Ottoman state in 1390. The area became part of the Ottoman Aidin Vilayet (\"province\"), and is now in the modern republic of Turkey.\n\nLydia had numerous Christian communities and, after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Lydia became one of the provinces of the diocese of Asia in the Patriarchate of Constantinople. \nThe ecclesiastical province of Lydia had a metropolitan diocese at Sardis and suffragan dioceses for Philadelphia, Thyatira, Tripolis, Settae, Gordus, Tralles, Silandus, Maeonia, Apollonos Hierum, Mostene, Apollonias, Attalia, Hyrcania, Bage, Balandus, Hermocapella, Hierocaesarea, Acrassus, Dalda, Stratonicia, Cerasa, Gabala, Satala, Aureliopolis and Hellenopolis. Bishops from the various dioceses of Lydia were well represented at the Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.\n\nAncient episcopal sees of the late Roman province of Lydia are listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\nBULLET::::- Ancient regions of Anatolia\nBULLET::::- Digda\nBULLET::::- List of Kings of Lydia\nBULLET::::- List of satraps of Lydia\nBULLET::::- Ludim\n\n\nBULLET::::- Reid Goldsborough. \"World's First Coin\".\nBULLET::::- R.

It is the most westerly point of mainland Cornwall and England, situated within the Penwith peninsula about west-south-west of Penzance at the western end of the A30 road. To the east of it is the English Channel, and to the west the Celtic Sea.\n\nThe actual Land’s End or Peal Point, is a modest headland compared with nearby headlands such as Pedn-men-dhu overlooking Sennen Cove and Pordenack, to the south. The present hotel and tourist complex is at Carn Kez, 200 m south of the actual Land’s End. Land's End has a particular resonance because it is often used to suggest distance. Land's End to John o' Groats in Scotland is a distance of by road and this \"Land's End to John o' Groats\" distance is often used to define charitable events such as end-to-end walks and races in the UK. Land's End to the northernmost point of England is a distance of by road.\n\nThe westernmost promontory at Land's End is known as Dr Syntax's Head. The character Dr Syntax was invented by the writer William Combe in his 1809 comic verse \"The Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque\", which satirised the work of seekers of the \"picturesque\" such as William Gilpin. A nearby promontory is called Dr Johnson's Head after Samuel Johnson, who referred to a hypothetical Cornish declaration of independence in his 1775 essay \"Taxation no Tyranny\".\n\nThe area around Land's End has been designated part of an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for rare species of flora. \n\nLand's End is a popular venue for rock climbers.\n\nThe Longships, a group of rocky islets are just over offshore, and together with the Seven Stones Reef and the Isles of Scilly which lie about southwest — are part of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature.\n\nThe cliffs are made of granite, an igneous rock, which means they are resistant to weathering, and have steep cliff faces. There are two varieties of granite represented at Land's End. Adjacent to the hotel the granite is coarse-grained with large phenocrysts of orthoclase, sometimes more than in length. To the north, at the First and Last House, there is a finer grained granite with fewer and smaller phenocrysts, and the different granites can be seen from a distance by the smoother weathering of the finer variety. The granite dates to 268–275 million years ago of the Permian period. The contact zone between the Land's End granite pluton and the altered ″country rocks″ is nearby and the Longships Lighthouse, offshore, is built on the country rock.\n\nIn 1769, the antiquarian William Borlase wrote:\nOf this time we are to understand what Edward I. says (Sheringham. p. 129.) that Britain, Wales, and Cornwall, were the portion of Belinus, elder son of Dunwallo, and that that part of the Island, afterwards called England, was divided in three shares, viz. Britain, which reached from the Tweed, Westward, as far as the river Ex; Wales inclosed by the rivers Severn, and Dee; and Cornwall from the river Ex to the Land's-End.\n\nTourists have been visiting Land’s End for over three hundred years. In 1649, an early visitor was the poet John Taylor, who was hoping to find subscribers for his new book \"Wanderings to see the Wonders of the West\". In 1878 people left Penzance by horse-drawn vehicles from outside the Queens and Union hotels and travelled via St Buryan and Treen, to see the Logan Rock. There was a short stop to look at Porthcurno and the Eastern Telegraph Company followed by refreshments at the First and Last Inn in Sennen. They then headed for Land’s End, often on foot or horse, because of the uneven and muddy lanes. Over one hundred people could be at Land's End at any one time. At Carn Kez, the First and Last Inn owned a small house which looked after the horses while visitors roamed the cliffs. The house at Carn Kez developed into the present hotel. The earliest part of the house was damaged by the Luftwaffe when a plane returning from a raid on Cardiff jettisoned its remaining bombs. 53 fisherman were injured or killed. In the build-up to D-Day American troops were billeted in the hotel leaving the building in a bad state.\nLand's End was owned by a Cornish family until 1982, when it was sold to David Goldstone. In 1987, Peter de Savary outbid the National Trust to purchase Land’s End for almost £7 million from David Goldstone. He had two new buildings erected and much of the present theme park development was instigated by him. He sold both Land's End and John o' Groats to businessman Graham Ferguson Lacey in 1991. The current owners purchased Land's End in 1996 and formed a company named Heritage Great Britain PLC. Attractions at the theme park include children's playgrounds and recorded music. Twice a week in August, Land's End hosts 'Magic in the Skies', a night-time firework spectacular with music by British composer Christopher Bond and narrated by actress Miriam Margolyes. Within the complex is the Land's End Hotel.\n\nIn May 2012, Land's End received worldwide publicity as the starting point of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.\n\nLand's End is either the start or finishing point of end to end journeys with John o'Groats in Scotland. One of the earliest was by Carlisle who left Land's End on 23 September 1879, went to John O'Groats House and arrived back at Land's End on 15 December; taking 72 days (exclusive of Sundays); covering . To prove his journey, he kept a log book which was stamped at any Post Office he passed. An early end to end on bicycle was completed by Messrs Blackwell and Harman of Canonbury Bicycle Club. Starting at Land's End they covered in thirteen days in July/August 1880. Nearly two years later the Hon I Keith-Falconer travelled . from Land's End, in twelve days, 23¼ hours, on a bicycle.\n\nOn the south side of Carn Kez the land slopes away to a shallow valley containing a small stream and the former Greeb Farm. In 1879 a derrick was used for hauling seaweed from the beach 40 feet below for use as a soil improver.\n\nBULLET::::- Land's End Airport\nBULLET::::- Land's End to John o' Groats\nBULLET::::- John o' Groats\nBULLET::::- Sennen, the nearest village\nBULLET::::- Corrachadh Mòr, the most westerly point in Great Britain\nBULLET::::- Finisterra\nBULLET::::- Lizard Point, southernmost point of mainland England.\nBULLET::::- Marshall Meadows Bay, northernmost point of England.\nBULLET::::- Ness Point, easternmost point of England.\n"}

It was written by Lucius Ampelius, who was possibly a tutor or schoolmaster. \n\nThe book is dedicated to a Macrinus, who may have been the emperor who reigned 217–218, but that name was not uncommon, and it seems more likely he was simply a young man with a thirst for universal knowledge, which the book was compiled to satisfy.\n\nThe book's object and scope are indicated in its dedication:\nThe \"Liber Memorialis\" seems to have been intended as a textbook to be learned by heart. This little work, in fifty chapters, gives a sketch of cosmography, geography, mythology (Chapters I-X), and history (Chapters X to end). The historical portion, dealing mainly with the republican period, is untrustworthy and the text in many places corrupt; the earlier chapters are more valuable, and contain some interesting information.\n\nChapter VIII (\"Miracula Mundi\") contains the following, the only reference by an ancient writer to the famous sculptures of the Pergamon Altar, which were discovered in 1871, excavated in 1878, and are now in Berlin:\n\nNothing is known of the date at which the work was written; the times of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, the beginning of the 3rd century have all been suggested. However, in Chapter V De Orbe Terrarum (The World), Ampelius refers to the \"Tigris and Euphrates in Parthia,\" which suggests that Ampelius wrote before the Sassanians overthrew the Parthians in 224.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Liber Memorialis\" was published in 1638 by Claudius Salmasius (Saumaise) from the Dijon manuscript, now lost, together with the \"Epitome\" of Florus.

During the latter's reign, Andrewes served successively as Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and of Winchester and oversaw the translation of the \"King James Version of the Bible\" (or \"Authorized Version\"). In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a Lesser Festival.\n\nAndrewes was born in 1555 near All Hallows, Barking, by the Tower of London, of an ancient Suffolk family later domiciled at Chichester Hall, at Rawreth in Essex; his father, Thomas, was master of Trinity House. Andrewes attended the Cooper's free school, in Ratcliff, in the parish of Stepney and then the Merchant Taylors' School under Richard Mulcaster. In 1571 he entered Pembroke Hall, Cambridge and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, proceeding to a Master of Arts degree in 1578. His academic reputation spread so quickly that on the foundation in 1571 of Jesus College, Oxford he was named in the charter as one of the founding scholars \"without his privity\" (Isaacson, 1650); his connection with the college seems to have been purely notional, however. In 1576 he was elected fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge; on 11 June 1580 he was ordained a priest by William Chaderton, Bishop of Chester and in 1581 was incorporated Master of Arts (MA) at Oxford. As catechist at his college he read lectures on the Decalogue (published in 1630), which aroused great interest.\n\nOnce a year he would spend a month with his parents, and during this vacation, he would find a master from whom he would learn a language of which he had no previous knowledge. In this way, after a few years, he acquired most of the modern languages of Europe.\n\nAndrewes was the elder brother of the scholar and cleric Roger Andrewes, who also served as a translator for the King James Version of the Bible.\n\nIn 1588, following a period as chaplain to Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, Lord President of the Council in the North, he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate in the City of London, where he delivered striking sermons on the temptation in the wilderness and the Lord's Prayer. In a great sermon (during Easter week) on 10 April 1588, he stoutly vindicated the Reformed character of the Church of England against the claims of Roman Catholicism and adduced John Calvin as a new writer, with lavish praise and affection.\n\nThrough the influence of Francis Walsingham, Andrewes was appointed prebendary of St Pancras in St Paul's, London, in 1589, and subsequently became Master of his own college of Pembroke, as well as a chaplain to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury. From 1589 to 1609 he was prebendary of Southwell. On 4 March 1590, as a chaplain of Elizabeth I, he preached before her an outspoken sermon and, in October that year, gave his introductory lecture at St Paul's, undertaking to comment on the first four chapters of the Book of Genesis. These were later compiled as \"The Orphan Lectures\" (1657).\n\nAndrewes liked to move among the people, yet found time to join a society of antiquaries, of which Walter Raleigh, Philip Sidney, Burleigh, Arundel, the Herberts, Saville, John Stow and William Camden were members. Elizabeth I had not advanced him further on account of his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. In 1598 he declined the bishoprics of Ely and Salisbury, because of the conditions attached. On 23 November 1600, he preached at Whitehall a controversial sermon on justification. In July 1601 he was appointed Dean of Westminster and gave much attention to the school there.\n\nOn the accession of James I, to whom his somewhat pedantic style of preaching recommended him, Andrewes rose into great favour. He assisted at James's coronation, and in 1604 took part in the Hampton Court Conference.\n\nAndrewes' name is the first on the list of divines appointed to compile the \"Authorized Version\" of the Bible. He headed the \"First Westminster Company\" which took charge of the first books of the Old Testament (Genesis to 2 Kings). He acted, furthermore, as a sort of general editor for the project as well.\n\nOn 31 October 1605 his election as Bishop of Chichester was confirmed, he was consecrated a bishop on 3 November, installed at Chichester Cathedral on 18 November and made Lord High Almoner (until 1619). Following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot Andrewes was asked to prepare a sermon to be presented to the king in 1606 (Sermons Preached upon the V of November, in Lancelot Andrewes, XCVI Sermons, 3rd. Edition (London,1635) pp. 889,890, 900-1008 ). In this sermon Lancelot Andrewes justified the need to commemorate the deliverance and defined the nature of celebrations. This sermon became the foundation of celebrations which continue 400 years later. In 1609 he published \"Tortura Torti\", a learned work which grew out of the Gunpowder Plot controversy and was written in answer to Bellarmine's \"Matthaeus Tortus\", which attacked James I's book on the oath of allegiance. After moving to Ely (his election to that See was confirmed on 22 September), he again controverted Bellarmine in the \"Responsio ad Apologiam\".\n\nIn 1617 he accompanied James I to Scotland with a view to persuading the Scots that Episcopacy was preferable to Presbyterianism. He was made dean of the Chapel Royal and translated (by the confirmation of his election to that See in February 1619) to Winchester, a diocese that he administered with great success. Following his death in 1626 in his Southwark palace, he was mourned alike by leaders in Church and state, and buried beside the high altar in St Saviour's (now Southwark Cathedral, then in the Diocese of Winchester).\n\nTwo generations later, Richard Crashaw caught up the universal sentiment, when in his lines \"Upon Bishop Andrewes' Picture before his Sermons\" he exclaims:\n\nAndrewes was a friend of Hugo Grotius, and one of the foremost contemporary scholars, but is chiefly remembered for his style of preaching. As a churchman he was typically Anglican, equally removed from the Puritan and the Roman positions. A good summary of his position is found in his \"First Answer to Cardinal Perron\", who had challenged James I's use of the title \"Catholic\". His position in regard to the Eucharist is naturally more mature than that of the first reformers.\n\nAs to the Real Presence we are agreed; our controversy is as to the mode of it. As to the mode we define nothing rashly, nor anxiously investigate, any more than in the Incarnation of Christ we ask how the human is united to the divine nature in One Person. There is a real change in the elements—we allow \"ut panis iam consecratus non sit panis quem natura formavit; sed, quem benedictio consecravit, et consecrando etiam immutavit\". (\"Responsio\", p. 263).\nAdoration is permitted, and the use of the terms \"sacrifice\" and \"altar\" maintained as being consonant with scripture and antiquity. Christ is \"a sacrifice—so, to be slain; a propitiatory sacrifice—so, to be eaten.\" (\"Sermons\", vol. ii. p. 296).\n\nBy the same rules that the Passover was, by the same may ours be termed a sacrifice. In rigour of speech, neither of them; for to speak after the exact manner of divinity, there is but one only sacrifice, \"veri nominis\", that is Christ's death. And that sacrifice but once actually performed at His death, but ever before represented in figure, from the beginning; and ever since repeated in memory to the world's end. That only absolute, all else relative to it, representative of it, operative by it ... Hence it is that what names theirs carried, ours do the like, and the Fathers make no scruple at it—no more need we.(\"Sermons,\" vol. ii. p. 300).\n\nAndrewes preached regularly and submissively before James I and his court on the anniversaries of the Gowrie Conspiracy and the Gunpowder Plot. These sermons were used to promulgate the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nHis \"Life\" was written by Whyte (Edinburgh, 1896), M. Wood (New York, 1898), and Ottley (Boston, 1894). His services to his church have been summed up thus: (1) he has a keen sense of the proportion of the faith and maintains a clear distinction between what is fundamental, needing ecclesiastical commands, and subsidiary, needing only ecclesiastical guidance and suggestion; (2) as distinguished from the earlier protesting standpoint, e.g. of the Thirty-nine Articles, he emphasized a positive and constructive statement of the Anglican position.\n\nHis best-known work is the \"Preces Privatae or Private Prayers\", edited by Alexander Whyte (1896), which has widespread appeal and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. The \"Preces Privatae\" were first published by R. Drake in 1648; an improved edition by F. E. Brightman appeared in 1903. John Rutter set some of those prayers to music. Andrewes's other works occupy eight volumes in the \"Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology\" (1841 – 1854). Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of Charles I, have been occasionally reprinted, and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes has been commemorated by literary greats such as T. S. Eliot.\n\nAndrewes was considered, next to Ussher, to be the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste. Nevertheless, there are passages of extraordinary beauty and profundity. His doctrine was High Church, and in his life he was humble, pious, and charitable. He continues to influence religious thinkers to the present day, and was cited as an influence by T. S. Eliot, among others. Eliot also borrowed, almost word for word and without his usual acknowledgement, a passage from Andrewes' 1622 Christmas Day sermon for the opening of his poem \"Journey of the Magi\". In his 1997 novel \"Timequake\", Kurt Vonnegut suggested that Andrewes was \"the greatest writer in the English language,\" citing as proof the first few verses of the 23rd Psalm. His translation work has also led him to appear as a character in three plays dealing with the King James Bible, Howard Brenton's \"Anne Boleyn\" (2010), Jonathan Holmes' \"Into Thy Hands\" (2011) and David Edgar's \"Written on the Heart\" (2011).\n\nHe has an academic cap named after him, known as the Bishop Andrewes cap, which is like a mortarboard but made of velvet, floppy and has a tump or tuff instead of a tassel. This was in fact the ancient version of the mortarboard before the top square was stiffened and the tump replaced by a tassel and button. This cap is still used by Cambridge DDs and at certain institutions as part of their academic dress.\n\nBULLET::::- 1555–: Lancelot Andrewes Esq.\nBULLET::::- –1589: \"The Reverend\" Lancelot Andrewes\nBULLET::::- 1589–bef. 1590: \"The Reverend\" Prebendary Lancelot Andrewes\nBULLET::::- bef. 1590–1594: \"The Reverend\" Prebendary Doctor Lancelot Andrewes\nBULLET::::- 1594–1601: \"The Reverend\" Canon Doctor Lancelot Andrewes\nBULLET::::- 1601–1605: \"The Very Reverend\" Doctor Lancelot Andrewes\nBULLET::::- 1605–1626: \"The Right Reverend\" Doctor Lancelot Andrewes\n\n\nBULLET::::- Lancelot Andrewes on \"Project Canterbury\"\n"}

His wife was Tanaquil.\n\nAccording to Livy, Tarquin came from Etruria. Livy claims that his original Etruscan name was \"Lucumo\", but since lucumo (Etruscan \"Lauchume\") is the Etruscan word for \"king\", there is reason to believe that Priscus' name and title have been confused in the official tradition. After inheriting his father's entire fortune, Lucius attempted to gain a political office. Disgruntled with his opportunities in Etruria (he had been prohibited from obtaining political office in Tarquinii because of the ethnicity of his father, Demaratus, who came from the Greek city of Corinth), he migrated to Rome with his wife Tanaquil, at her suggestion. Legend has it that on his arrival in Rome in a chariot, an eagle took his cap, flew away and then returned it back upon his head. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, interpreted this as an omen of his future greatness. In Rome, he attained respect through his courtesy. The king himself noticed Tarquinius and, by his will, appointed Tarquinius guardian of his own sons.\n\nAlthough Ancus Marcius, the Roman king, was the grandson of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, the principle of hereditary monarchy was not yet established at Rome; none of the first three kings had been succeeded by their sons, and each subsequent king had been acclaimed by the people. Upon the death of Marcius, Tarquin addressed the \"Comitia Curiata\" and convinced them that he should be elected king over Marcius' natural sons, who were still only youths. In one tradition, the sons were away on a hunting expedition at the time of their father's death, and were thus unable to affect the assembly's choice.\n\nAccording to Livy, Tarquin increased the number of the Senate by adding one hundred men from the leading minor families. Among these was the family of the Octavii, from whom the first emperor, Augustus, was descended.\n\nTarquin's first war was waged against the Latins. Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", this war must have occurred prior to 588 BC.\n\nHis military ability was then tested by an attack from the Sabines, who received auxiliaries from five Etruscan cities. Tarquin doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort. The Sabines were defeated after difficult street fighting in the city of Rome. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquin received the town of Collatia, and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, better known as \"Egerius\", as commander of the garrison there. Tarquin returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph on September 13, 585 BC.\n\nSubsequently, the Latin cities of Corniculum, old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum were subdued and became Roman.\n\nSince Tarquin had kept the captured Etruscan auxiliaries prisoners for meddling in the war with the Sabines, the five Etruscan cities who had taken part declared war on Rome. Seven other Etruscan cities joined forces with them. The Etruscans soon captured the Roman colony at Fidenae, which thereupon became the focal point of the war. After several bloody battles, Tarquin was once again victorious, and he subjugated the Etruscan cities who had taken part in the war. At the successful conclusion of each of his wars, Rome was enriched by Tarquin's plunder. \n\nTarquin is said to have built the Circus Maximus, the first and largest stadium at Rome, for chariot racing. Raised seating was erected privately by the senators and equites, and other areas were marked out for private citizens. There the king established a series of annual games; according to Livy, the first horses and boxers to participate were brought from Etruria.\n\nAfter a great flood, Tarquin drained the damp lowlands of Rome by constructing the Cloaca Maxima, Rome's great sewer. He also constructed a stone wall around the city, and began the construction of a temple in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. The latter is said to have been funded in part by the plunder seized from the Sabines.\n\nAccording to Florus, Tarquin celebrated his triumphs in the Etruscan fashion, riding a golden chariot drawn by four horses, while wearing a gold-embroidered toga and the tunica palmata, a tunic upon which palm-leaves were embroidered. He also introduced other Etruscan insignia of civilian authority and military distinction: the sceptre of the king; the trabea, a purple garment that varied in form, but was perhaps most often used as a mantle; the fasces carried by the lictors; the curule chair; the toga praetexta, later worn by various magistrates and officials; the rings worn by senators; the paludamentum, a cloak associated with military command; and the phalera, a disc of metal worn on a soldier's breastplate during parades, or displayed on the standards of various military units. Strabo reports that Tarquin introduced Etruscan sacrificial and divinitory rites, as well as the tuba, a straight horn used chiefly for military purposes. \n\nTarquin is said to have reigned for thirty-eight years. According to legend, the sons of his predecessor, Ancus Marcius, believed that the throne should have been theirs. They arranged the king's assassination, disguised as a riot, during which Tarquin received a fatal blow to the head. However, the queen, Tanaquil, gave out that the king was merely wounded, and took advantage of the confusion to establish Servius Tullius as regent; when the death of Tarquin was confirmed, Tullius became king, in place of Marcius' sons, or those of Tarquin.\n\nTullius, said to have been the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who had fallen in battle against Tarquin, was brought to the palace as a child with his mother, Ocreisia. According to legend, Tanaquil discovered his potential for greatness by means of various omens, and therefore preferred him to her own sons. Tullius married Tarquinia, one of Priscus daughters, thus providing a vital link between the families. Tullius' own daughters were subsequently married to the king's sons (or, in some traditions, grandsons), Lucius and Arruns.\n\nMost ancient writers regarded Tarquin as the father of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, but some stated that the younger Tarquin was his grandson. As the younger Tarquin died about 496 BC, more than eighty years after Tarquinius Priscus, chronology seems to support the latter tradition. An Etruscan legend related by the emperor Claudius equates Servius Tullius with \"Macstarna\" (apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin \"magister\"), a companion of the Etruscan heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, who helped free the brothers from captivity, slaying their captors, including a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius. This episode is depicted in a fresco at the tomb of the Etruscan Saties family at Vulci, now known as the François Tomb. This tradition suggests that perhaps the sons of the elder Tarquin attempted to seize power, but were defeated by the regent, Servius Tullius, and his companions; Tullius would then have attempted to end the dynastic struggle by marrying his daughters to the grandsons of Tarquinius Priscus. However, this plan ultimately failed, as Tullius was himself assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law, who succeeded him.\n\nBULLET::::- Livy, \"\"\nBULLET::::- Florus, \"\"\nBULLET::::- Eutropius, \"\"\n\nBULLET::::- Stemma Tarquiniorum, Tarquinius family tree\n"}
{"id": "18047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18047", "title": "Lucius Tarquinius Superbus", "text": "Lucius Tarquinius Superbus\n\nLucius Tarquinius Superbus (died 495 BC) was the legendary seventh and final king of Rome, reigning from 535 BC until the popular uprising in 509 BC that led to the establishment of the Roman Republic. He is commonly known as Tarquin the Proud, from his cognomen \"Superbus\" (Latin for \"proud, arrogant, lofty\"). \n\nAncient accounts of the regal period mingle history and legend. Tarquin was said to have been the son or grandson of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and to have gained the throne through the murders of both his wife and his elder brother, followed by the assassination of his predecessor, Servius Tullius. His reign is described as a tyranny that justified the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nTarquin was said to be the son or grandson of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and Tanaquil. Tanaquil had engineered her husband's succession to the Roman kingdom on the death of Ancus Marcius. When the sons of Marcius subsequently arranged the elder Tarquin's assassination in 579 BC, Tanaquil placed Servius Tullius on the throne, in preference to her own sons. \n\nAccording to an Etruscan tradition, the hero Macstarna, usually equated with Servius Tullius, defeated and killed a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius, and rescued the brothers Caelius and Aulus Vibenna from captivity. This may recollect an otherwise forgotten attempt by the sons of Tarquin the Elder to reclaim the throne.\n\nTo forestall further dynastic strife, Servius married his daughters, known to history as Tullia Major and Tullia Minor, to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the future king, and his brother Arruns. One of Tarquin's sisters, Tarquinia, married Marcus Junius Brutus, and was the mother of Lucius Junius Brutus, one of the men who would later lead the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom.\n\nThe elder sister, Tullia Major, was of mild disposition, yet married the ambitious Tarquin. Her younger sister, Tullia Minor, was of fiercer temperament, but her husband Arruns was not. She came to despise him, and conspired with Tarquin to bring about the deaths of Tullia Major and Arruns. After the murder of their spouses, Tarquin and Tullia were married .. Together, they had three sons: Titus, Arruns, and Sextus, and a daughter, Tarquinia, who married Octavius Mamilius, the prince of Tusculum.\n\nTullia encouraged her husband to advance his own position, ultimately persuading him to usurp Servius. Tarquin solicited the support of the patrician senators, especially those from families who had received their senatorial rank under Tarquin the Elder. He bestowed presents upon them, and spread criticism of Servius the king.\n\nIn time, Tarquin felt ready to seize the throne. He went to the senate-house with a group of armed men, sat himself on the throne, and summoned the senators to attend upon King Tarquin. He then spoke to the senators, denigrating Servius as a slave born of a slave; for failing to be elected by the senate and the people during an interregnum, as had been the tradition for the election of kings of Rome; for having become king through the machinations of a woman; for favouring the lower classes of Rome over the wealthy, and for taking the land of the upper classes for distribution to the poor; and for instituting the census so that the wealth of the upper classes might be exposed in order to excite popular envy.\n\nWhen word of this brazen deed reached Servius, he hurried to the curia to confront Tarquin, who leveled the same accusations against his father-in-law, and then in his youth and vigor carried the king outside and flung him down the steps of the senate-house and into the street. The king's retainers fled, and as he made his way, dazed and unattended, toward the palace, the aged Servius was set upon and murdered by Tarquin's assassins, perhaps on the advice of his own daughter.\n\nTullia, meanwhile, drove in her chariot to the senate-house, where she was the first to hail her husband as king. But Tarquin bade her return home, concerned that the crowd might do her violence. As she drove toward the Urbian Hill, her driver stopped suddenly, horrified at the sight of the king's body, lying in the street. But in a frenzy, Tullia herself seized the reins, and drove the wheels of her chariot over her father's corpse. The king's blood spattered against the chariot and stained Tullia's clothes, so that she brought a gruesome relic of the murder back to her house. The street where Tullia disgraced the dead king afterward became known as the \"Vicus Sceleratus,\" the Street of Crime.\n\nTarquin commenced his reign by refusing to bury the dead Servius, and then putting to death a number of leading senators, whom he suspected of remaining loyal to Servius. By not replacing the slain senators, and not consulting the senate on matters of government, he diminished both the size and the authority of the senate. In another break with tradition, Tarquin judged capital crimes without the advice of counselors, causing fear amongst those who might think to oppose him. He made a powerful ally when he betrothed his daughter to Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, among the most eminent of the Latin chiefs.\n\nEarly in his reign, Tarquin called a meeting of the Latin leaders to discuss the bonds between Rome and the Latin towns. The meeting was held at a grove sacred to the goddess Ferentina. At the meeting, Turnus Herdonius inveighed against Tarquin's arrogance, and warned his countrymen against trusting the Roman king. Tarquin then bribed Turnus' servant to store a large number of swords in his master's lodging. Tarquin called together the Latin leaders, and accused Turnus of plotting his assassination. The Latin leaders accompanied Tarquin to Turnus' lodging and, the swords then being discovered, the Latin's guilt was then speedily inferred. Turnus was condemned to be thrown into a pool of water in the grove, with a wooden frame, or \"cratis\", placed over his head, into which stones were thrown, drowning him. The meeting of the Latin chiefs then continued, and Tarquin persuaded them to renew their treaty with Rome, becoming her allies rather than her enemies. It was agreed that the soldiers of the Latins would attend at the grove on an appointed day, and form a united military force with the Roman army.\n\nNext, Tarquin instigated a war against the Volsci, taking the wealthy town of Suessa Pometia. He celebrated a triumph, and with the spoils of this conquest, he commenced the erection of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which Tarquin the Elder had vowed. He then engaged in a war with Gabii, one of the Latin cities that had rejected the treaty with Rome. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquin resorted to another stratagem. His son, Sextus, pretending to be ill-treated by his father, and covered with the bloody marks of stripes, fled to Gabii. The infatuated inhabitants entrusted him with the command of their troops, and when he had obtained the unlimited confidence of the citizens, he sent a messenger to his father to inquire how he should deliver the city into his hands. The king, who was walking in his garden when the messenger arrived, made no reply, but kept striking off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick. Sextus took the hint, and put to death, or banished on false charges, all the leading men of Gabii, after which he had no difficulty in compelling the city to submit.\n\nTarquin agreed upon a peace with the Aequi, and renewed the treaty of peace between Rome and the Etruscans. According to the Fasti Triumphales, he won a victory over the Sabines, and established Roman colonies at the towns of Signia and Circeii.\n\nAt Rome, Tarquin leveled the top of the Tarpeian Rock, overlooking the Forum, and removed a number of ancient Sabine shrines, in order to make way for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. He constructed tiers of seats in the circus, and ordered the excavation of Rome's great sewer, the \"cloaca maxima\".\nAccording to one story, Tarquin was approached by the Cumaean Sibyl, who offered him nine books of prophecy at an exorbitant price. Tarquin abruptly refused, and the Sibyl proceeded to burn three of the nine. She then offered him the remaining books, but at the same price. He hesitated, but refused again. The Sibyl then burned three more books before offering him the three remaining books at the original price. At last Tarquin accepted, in this way obtaining the Sibylline Books.\n\nIn 509 BC, having angered the Roman populace through the pace and burden of constant building, Tarquin embarked on a campaign against the Rutuli. At that time, the Rutuli were a very wealthy nation, and Tarquin was keen to obtain the spoils that would come with victory, in hopes of assuaging the ire of his subjects. Failing to take their capital of Ardea by storm, the king determined to take the city by siege.\n\nWith little prospect of battle, the young noblemen in the king's army fell to drinking and boasting. When the subject turned to the virtue of their wives, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus claimed to have the most dedicated of spouses. With his companions, they secretly visited each other's homes, and discovered all of the wives enjoying themselves, except for Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, who was engaged in domestic activities. Lucretia received the princes graciously, and together her beauty and virtue kindled the flame of desire in Collatinus' cousin, Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son. After a few days, Sextus returned to Collatia, where he implored Lucretia to give herself to him. When she refused, he threatened to kill her, and claim that he had discovered her in the act of adultery with a slave, if she did not yield to him.\n\nTo spare her husband the shame threatened by Sextus, Lucretia submitted to his whims. But when he had departed for the camp, she sent for her husband and father, revealing the whole affair, and accusing Sextus. Despite the pleas of her family, Lucretia took her own life out of shame. Collatinus, together with his father-in-law, Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and his companions, Lucius Junius Brutus and Publius Valerius, swore an oath to expel the king and his family from Rome.\n\nAs Tribune of the Celeres, Brutus was head of the king's personal bodyguard, and entitled to summon the Roman comitia. This he did, and by recounting the various grievances of the people, the king's abuses of power, and by inflaming public sentiment with the tale of the rape of Lucretia, Brutus persuaded the comitia to revoke the king's imperium and send him into exile. Tullia fled the city in fear of the mob, while Sextus Tarquinius, his deed revealed, fled to Gabii, where he hoped for the protection of the Roman garrison. However, his previous conduct there had made him many enemies, and he was soon assassinated. In place of the king, the \"comitia centuriata\" resolved to elect two consuls to hold power jointly. Lucretius, the prefect of the city, presided over the election of the first consuls, Brutus and Collatinus.\n\nWhen word of the uprising reached the king, Tarquin abandoned Ardea, and sought support from his allies in Etruria. The cities of Veii and Tarquinii sent contingents to join the king's army, and he prepared to march upon Rome. Brutus, meanwhile, prepared a force to meet the returning army. In a surprising reversal, Brutus demanded that his colleague, Collatinus, resign the consulship and go into exile, because he bore the hated name of Tarquinius. Stunned by this betrayal, Collatinus complied, and his father-in-law was chosen to succeed him.\n\nMeanwhile, the king sent ambassadors to the senate, ostensibly to request the return of his personal property, but in reality to subvert a number of Rome's leading men. When this plot was discovered, those found guilty were put to death by the consuls. Brutus was forced to condemn to death his two sons, Titus and Tiberius, who had taken part in the conspiracy. Leaving Lucretius in charge of the city, Brutus departed to meet the king upon the field of battle. At the Battle of Silva Arsia, the Romans won a hard-fought victory over the king and his Etruscan allies. Each side sustained painful losses; the consul Brutus and his cousin, Arruns Tarquinius, fell in battle against each other.\n\nAfter this failure, Tarquin turned to Lars Porsena, the king of Clusium. Porsena's march on Rome and the valiant defense of the Romans achieved legendary status, giving rise to the story of Horatius at the bridge, and the bravery of Gaius Mucius Scaevola. Accounts vary as to whether Porsena finally entered Rome, or was thwarted, but modern scholarship suggests that he was able to occupy the city briefly before withdrawing. In any case, his efforts were of no avail to the exiled Roman king.\nTarquin's final attempt to regain the Roman kingdom came in 498 or 496 BC, when he persuaded his son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, dictator of Tusculum, to march on Rome at the head of a Latin army. The Roman army was led by the dictator, Albus Postumius Albus, and his Master of the Horse, Titus Aebutius Elva, while the elderly king and his last remaining son, Titus Tarquinius, accompanied by a force of Roman exiles, fought alongside the Latins. Once more the battle was hard fought and narrowly decided, with both sides suffering great losses. Mamilius was slain, the master of the horse grievously injured, and Titus Tarquinius barely escaped with his life. But in the end, the Latins abandoned the field, and Rome retained her independence.\n\nAfter the Latin defeat and the death of his son-in-law, Tarquin went to the court of Aristodemus at Cumae, where he died in 495.\n\nTarquin is mentioned by William Shakespeare in his plays, \"Titus Andronicus\", \"Julius Caesar\", \"Coriolanus\", \"Macbeth\", and \"Cymbeline\".\n\nIn 1765, Patrick Henry gave a speech before the Virginia House of Burgesses, in opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765. Toward the end of his speech, he inserted as a rhetorical flourish, a comparison between King George III and various historical figures who were brought low by their enemies, including Charles I, Caesar, and in some accounts of the speech, Tarquin.\n\nThe cultural phenomenon known as \"tall poppy syndrome,\" in which persons of unusual merit are attacked or resented because of their achievements, derives its name from the episode in Livy, in which Tarquin is said to have instructed his son, Sextus, to weaken the city of Gabii by destroying its leading men. The motif of using an unwitting messenger to deliver such a message, through the metaphor of cutting the heads off the tallest poppies, may have been borrowed from Herodotus, whose \"Histories\" contain a similar story, involving ears of wheat instead of poppies. A passage concerning Livy's version of the story appears in Kierkegaard's \"Fear and Trembling\".\n\nBenjamin Britten employed the character in his 1946 chamber opera \"The Rape of Lucretia\".\n\nTarquin is also shown in the 4th book of The Trials Of Apollo pentalogy series by Rick Riordan. He is delicted as a zombie king who attacks the demigods just because they were trying to rewrite the Sybilline Books. However Diana kills Tarquin once and for all.\n\nBULLET::::- Britannica: Tarquin, King of Rome\nBULLET::::- Stemma Tarquiniorum\n"}
